1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,034
Yes, I'm a very lazy eater.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,710
That's why I like soup.
First of all, it looks half-digested...

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,235
...so you feel like half the work
is done already.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,868
I'm hoping Campbell's comes out
with an IV line of soup...

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,554
...that you could just jam
right into your arm, you know?

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,995
Campbell's tomato intravenous.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,912
Mainline gumbo.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,640
Everyone just sitting around
at dinner with their soup IV...

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,030
...hanging on the hook there,
you know?

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,236
How's yours, Grandpa?

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,595
Oh, chunky style.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,597
What theatre do you wanna
go to tonight?

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,230
We got 61 st and 3rd
or 84th and Broadway.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,192
Which one you wanna go to,
Schmoopie?

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,157
You called me "Schmoopie."
You're Schmoopie.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,833
- You're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,230
You're Schmoopie.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,392
All right, Schmoopies,
what's it gonna be?

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,676
- Pick a theatre.
- We'll go to 3rd Avenue.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,752
So can you come with us
to the soup place?

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,992
No, you have a good lunch.
I'll meet you here for the movie.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,349
- Hey.
- Hey.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,078
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hi, Sheila.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,629
All right, then I'll see you later.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,711
- Bye, Schmoopie.
- Bye, Schmoopie.

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,673
Okay, we ready to go?

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,990
Yes, please. Please, let's go.

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,752
I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,150
- No, we gotta go to the soup place.
- What soup place?

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,390
There's a soup stand.
Kramer's been going there.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,549
He's always raving.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,029
I finally got a chance to go,
and I tell you this:

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,519
You will be stunned.

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,954
Stunned by soup?

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,157
You can't eat this soup standing up.
Your knees buckle.

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,799
All right, let's go. Come on.

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,552
There's only one caveat.

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,029
Guy who runs the place
is a little temperamental.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,509
Especially about
the ordering procedure.

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,752
He's secretly referred to
as the "Soup Nazi."

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,798
What happens
if you don't order right?

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
- He yells, and you don't get your soup.
- What?

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,875
Just follow the procedure
and you will be fine.

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,076
- All right, let's go over that again.
- All right.

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,472
As you walk in the place,
move immediately to your right.

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,915
Okay, the main thing
is to keep the line moving.

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,640
You hold out your money,
speak your soup in a clear voice...

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,756
...step to the left, and receive soup.
- Right.

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,956
It's very important not
to embellish your order.

50
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,271
No extraneous comments,
no questions, no compliments.

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,034
- Oh, boy, I'm really scared.
- Elaine.

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,395
Jerry, that's enough now
about the Soup Nazi.

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,874
Look at this.

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,271
You know what this is?
This is an antique armoire.

55
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,955
It's French, armoire.

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,758
Armoire.

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,672
- How much is this?
- I was asking 250.

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,990
But you got a nice face.
Two even.

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,277
Two hundred. You know, I've always
wanted one of these things.

60
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,069
- He gave you the nice-face discount.
- Yeah. All right, you guys go ahead.

61
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,312
- What about the soup?
- I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,152
Pardon.

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,594
This line is huge.

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,239
And it's like this all the time.

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,834
Isn't that that Bania guy?

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,397
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,949
Too late. I think
he picked up the scent.

68
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,194
Hey, Jerry, I didn't know
you liked soup.

69
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,833
Hard to believe.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,468
This guy makes the best soup
in the city, Jerry. The best.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,551
You know what they call him?
"Soup Nazi."

72
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,755
All right, Bania.

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,514
- I'm not letting you cut in line.
- Why not?

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,636
If he catches us,
we'll never get soup again.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,233
Okay, okay.

76
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,275
Medium turkey chili.

77
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,711
Medium crab bisque.

78
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,917
- I didn't get any bread.
- Just forget it. Let it go.

79
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,629
Excuse me.
I think you forgot my bread.

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,153
Bread, $2.00 extra.

81
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,788
Two dollars? But everyone
in front of me got free bread.

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,712
- You want bread?
- Yes, please.

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,472
Three dollars!

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,559
- What?
- No soup for you!

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,270
What do you mean,
I can't bring it in? I live here.

86
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,271
It's Sunday.
There's no moving on Sunday.

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,829
- That's the rule.
- But I didn't know, Tom.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,151
Can't you just make an exception?
Please? I've got a nice face.

89
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,598
Tomorrow, okay?
You move it in tomorrow.

90
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,954
I'll even give you a hand.

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,840
- You're gonna have to hold it.
- I'm the guy on the sidewalk.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,274
I don't have layaway.

93
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,715
Oh, no. Please don't go.

94
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,553
Please. Please don't walk away.

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,638
Oh, man.

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,954
Oh, this is fantastic.

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,356
How does he do it?

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,958
I don't see how you can sit there
eating, and not even offer me any?

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,317
I gave you a taste.
What do you want?

100
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,159
- Why can't we share?
- I told you not to say anything.

101
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,676
You can't go in there, flout the rules,
and then think I'm gonna share.

102
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,957
- Do you hear you yourself?
- I'm sorry.

103
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,317
This is what comes
from living under a Nazi regime.

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,275
Well, I gotta go back there
and try again.

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,514
- Hi.
- Hi.

106
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,954
- Hi, Schmoopie.
- Hi, Schmoopie.

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,475
- No, you're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.

108
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,596
- Going.
- Hey, listen...

109
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,990
...so we'll meet you and Susan
at the movie tonight?

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,950
You know what? I changed my mind.
I don't think so.

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,509
- Why?
- I just don't feel like it anymore.

112
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,116
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

113
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,631
Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?

114
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,191
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,355
Yeah.

116
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,159
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

117
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,675
Elaine has to leave her armoire
on the street all night.

118
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,239
I'm gonna guard it for her.

119
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,152
I need something to sit on.

120
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,231
Well, sit on one of your cushions.

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,073
But this is so nice and thick.

122
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,708
Ahoy, there.

123
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,836
Oh, Kramer, thank God.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,151
- I really appreciate your doing this.
- Well, you asked for it, you got it.

125
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,878
Do you need anything?

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,474
Well, a hot bowl of mulagatani
would hit the spot.

127
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,517
- Mulagatani?
- Yeah, it's an Indian soup.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,149
Simmered to perfection...

129
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,834
...by one of the great
soup artisans in the modern era.

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,439
Who, the Soup Nazi?

131
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,749
He's not a Nazi.

132
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,275
He just happens to be
a little eccentric.

133
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,873
You know, most geniuses are.

134
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,353
- I'll be back.
- Wait a second.

135
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,511
- You don't know how to order.
- No, I got it.

136
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,240
- No, Elaine.
- Hey, I got it.

137
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,472
Hey, didn't you already get soup?

138
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,517
No, I didn't get it.

139
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,757
Why? What happened?

140
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,831
I made a mistake.

141
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,953
Well, we'll see
what happens to you.

142
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,111
Yeah, no, listen, George,
I am quite certain...

143
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,794
...l'm walking out of there
with a bowl of soup.

144
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,712
Let me ask you something.
Is it just me...

145
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,633
...or do you find it unbearable
to be around Jerry and that girl?

146
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,552
Oh, I know.

147
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,869
It's awful.

148
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,678
Why do they do that
in front of people?

149
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,876
- I don't know.
- What is that with the Schmoopie?

150
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,951
- Schmoopie.
- Oh, stop it. I know.

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,237
I had to listen to a discussion on
which one is actually called Schmoopie.

152
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,470
I cancelled plans
to go to the movies with them.

153
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,313
- You know, we should say something.
- We absolutely should.

154
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,392
I mean, why does he do that?
Doesn't he know what a turnoff that is?

155
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,073
- He can be so weird sometimes.
- Yes.

156
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,912
- I haven't figured him out.
- Me neither.

157
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,317
I gotta focus.
I'm shifting into soup mode.

158
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,277
Oh, God.

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,031
Good afternoon.

160
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,318
One large crab bisque to go.

161
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,790
Bread. Beautiful.

162
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,554
You're pushing your luck, little man.

163
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,198
Sorry. Thank you. Thank you.

164
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,879
Hey, there.

165
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,756
Oh, one mulagatani, and...

166
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,832
What is that there?
Is that lima bean?

167
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,152
- Yes.
- Never been a big fan.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,035
You know what?

169
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like Al Pacino?

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,076
You know, Scent of a Woman.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,558
Very good. Very good.

172
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,836
You know something?
No soup for you!

173
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,549
- What?
- Come back, one year!

174
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,515
Next!

175
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,834
- Look at this.
- It's an antique.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,594
It's all handmade,
and I love the inlay.

177
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,273
Yes, yes. Me too.

178
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,715
It's gorgeous, completely. Pick it up.

179
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,429
- Pick it up from the bottom.
- Wait, what are you doing?

180
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,989
What does it look like we're doing?
We're taking this.

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,669
You can't take this.
This belongs to a friend of mine.

182
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,432
Look, you wanna get hurt?

183
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,991
I don't think you wanna get hurt.
If you wanna get hurt, I can hurt you.

184
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,354
Now, just back off.

185
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,552
- Bob.
- Just pick it up.

186
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,233
Hey, what is this, huh?

187
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,278
You have some kind of problem?
What is it you're not understanding?

188
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,795
We're taking the armoire,
and that's all there is to it.

189
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,552
Okay?

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,399
I mean, is he allowed to do this?

191
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,879
It's discrimination.

192
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,951
I'm gonna call the state's
attorney's office.

193
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,554
This is fabulous, my God.
Elaine, you have to taste this.

194
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,358
All right, all right.
Give me a taste.

195
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,033
- Oh, my God. I've gotta sit down.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,115
What happened?
Where's my armoire?

197
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,558
- It was stolen.
- What?

198
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,358
These street toughs,
they robbed me.

199
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,555
Street toughs took my armoire?

200
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,995
Yeah, it was very frightening.

201
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,479
My life was in danger.

202
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,551
You should've seen
the way they talked to me.

203
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,629
- I can't believe this!
- So where's the soup?

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,831
The Soup Nazi threw me out.

205
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,631
Yeah!

206
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,994
- What are you gonna get?
- I'll decide at the last minute.

207
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,952
You better decide, sister.
You're on deck.

208
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,438
Sheila!

209
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,191
What is this?
You're kissing in my line?

210
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,839
Nobody kisses in my line.

211
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,269
- I can kiss anywhere I want to.
- You just cost yourself a soup.

212
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,069
How dare you?

213
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,629
Come on, Jerry, we're leaving.

214
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,554
Jerry?

215
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,910
Do I know you?

216
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,394
So essentially,
you chose soup over a woman?

217
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,156
It was a bisque.

218
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,231
Yeah, you know what
I've just realized?

219
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,836
Suddenly, George has become
much more normal than you.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,070
- Really?
- Yeah. Well, I mean, think about it.

221
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,992
He's engaged to be married.

222
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,390
Your top priority is soup.

223
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,073
Have you tasted the soup?

224
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,149
Yeah, all right.
You made the right decision.

225
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,793
See, it's much easier
to patch things up with Sheila...

226
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,473
...than with the Soup Nazi.

227
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,557
- Hey.
- Hey.

228
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,392
- Oh, thanks.
- There he is.

229
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,313
Elaine, I'm really sorry
about the armoire.

230
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,515
Yeah, I know. Me too.

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,478
- So did these thieves want any money?
- No.

232
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,518
- They just wanted the armoire?
- Yeah, they were quite taken with it.

233
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,713
Yeah.

234
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,880
Have you noticed
George is acting a little strange lately?

235
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,268
No. In what way?

236
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,432
I don't know. A lot of attitude,
like he's better than me.

237
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,398
I don't think George has ever thought
he's better than anybody.

238
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,718
- Hello.
- Hello.

239
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,233
- Hello.
- Hello.

240
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,068
Were you just talking about me?
What's going on?

241
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,474
Absolutely not.

242
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,078
- Something's going on here.
- All right.

243
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,593
I'm gonna go get some soup.

244
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,035
One of these days,
that guy is gonna get his.

245
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,792
So how was the movie?

246
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,599
We didn't go.
Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.

247
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,758
Oh, yeah?

248
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,994
Yeah.

249
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,558
What, are you happy?

250
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,748
- Happy? Why should I be happy?
- I don't know.

251
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,797
But you look like you're happy.

252
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,279
Why should I care?

253
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,708
You can't fool me.

254
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,075
Don't insult me,
because I know when you're happy.

255
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,435
All right, I am happy.
And I'll tell you why.

256
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,751
The two of you were making me
and every one of your friends sick.

257
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,911
Right, Elaine?

258
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,594
Is that so?

259
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,230
Yeah. With all that kissing and the
"Schmoopie, Schmoopie, Schmoopie."

260
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,834
- Out in public like that. It's disgusting.
- Disgusting?

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,230
People who do that
should be arrested.

262
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,869
I guess I have all the more reason
to get back with her.

263
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,759
And we had a pact, you know.

264
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,589
- What?
- You shook my hand.

265
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,193
You're still with the pact?

266
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,715
- You reneged.
- All I did was shake your hand.

267
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,718
And then they just ran off
with the armoire, just like that.

268
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,314
This city.

269
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,398
One large jambalaya, please.

270
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,635
- So continue.
- My friend is awfully disappointed.

271
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,711
You know, she's very emotional.

272
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,038
Thank you.

273
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,636
Jambalaya.

274
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,114
All right, now listen to me.
You have been a good friend.

275
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,713
I have an armoire in my basement.

276
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,075
If you want to pick it up,
you're welcome to it.

277
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,196
So take it, it's yours.

278
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,112
How can I possibly thank you?

279
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,032
You are the only one
who understands me.

280
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,760
- You suffer for your soup.
- Yes, that is right.

281
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,798
You demand perfection
from yourself, from your soup.

282
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,155
How can I tolerate any less
from my customers?

283
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,552
Gazpacho, por fav or.

284
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,111
- "Por fav or"?
- Oh, I'm part Spanish.

285
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,113
Adios, muchacho.

286
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,555
You heard him. Get out.

287
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,719
It was stupid of me.

288
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,154
Well, it was very insulting.

289
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,390
No, I know.
I was really sort of half kidding.

290
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,559
Well, behind every joke
there's some truth.

291
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,836
Well, what about that
Bavarian cream pie joke?

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,228
There's no truth to that.

293
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,436
Nobody with a terminal illness
goes to Europe...

294
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,272
...for a piece of Bavarian cream pie...

295
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,876
...and then when they don't have it,
he says, "I'll just have some coffee."

296
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,789
- There's no truth to that.
- Well, I guess you're right.

297
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,755
- So am I forgiven, Schmoopie?
- Yes, Schmoopie.

298
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,271
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Susan.

299
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,032
George. You remember Sheila.

300
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,509
- Oh, yes. Hello.
- Hello. Won't you join us?

301
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,716
- No, thanks. Yes.
- Of course.

302
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,595
So...

303
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,557
...you sit on the same side
in a booth?

304
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,756
Yeah, that's right.
You got a problem?

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,551
I just think it's a little unusual
for two people to sit on one side...

306
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,631
...and leave the other side empty.

307
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,711
Well, we're changing the rules.

308
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,472
Well, good for you.

309
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,835
What are you getting, George?

310
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,517
I don't know, honey.
What do you wanna get?

311
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,717
I want you to get anything you want.

312
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,792
Because I love you so much,
and I want you to be happy.

313
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,393
Okay, sweetie?

314
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,391
Oh, George, you're so sweet.

315
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,393
Well, I can be a little
sweetie-tweetie-wheetie-wheetie.

316
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,316
What about you, Schmoopie?
How about a little tuna?

317
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,870
- You want a little tuna fishy?
- Yeah, a little tuna fishy.

318
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,839
Fishy.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,592
Come here.

320
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,032
And voilà!

321
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,998
- Yeah.
- Oh, I love it!

322
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,593
I absolutely love it!

323
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,830
Yeah, did the K-Man do it
or did the K-Man do it?

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,752
- The K-man did it!
- Yeah!

325
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,229
- How much did you pay for this?
- How about zero?

326
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,960
What? What? Whose was it?
Where'd you get it?

327
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,388
I'll tell you where I got it.

328
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,279
From the guy you callously
refer to as the Soup Nazi.

329
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,396
Get out!

330
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,594
The Soap Nazi gave it to you?
Why?

331
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,309
Well, I told him the whole story,
and he just let me have it.

332
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,677
Yeah, he's a wonderful man.

333
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,354
Yeah, you know,
a little bit misunderstood, but...

334
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,556
I'm gonna go down there
and personally thank him.

335
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,154
I mean, I had this guy all wrong.
This is wonderful.

336
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,753
Yeah, well, he's a dear.

337
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,268
How much tip
do you leave on 8.15?

338
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,953
You know, sweetie...

339
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,793
...I just want you to know
that I was so proud of you today...

340
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,793
...expressing your feelings
so freely in front of Jerry and all.

341
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,269
Just knowing that you're
not afraid of those things...

342
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,034
...it's such a great step forward
in our relationship.

343
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,188
Because you love
your little Kiki, don't you?

344
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,753
- How is he today?
- I think he's in a good mood.

345
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,917
Hi.

346
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,437
Kramer gave me the armoire,
and it is so beautiful.

347
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,196
I mean, I just can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

348
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,319
You? If I knew it was for you,
I never would have given it to him!

349
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,597
I would have taken a hatchet
and smashed it to pieces.

350
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,432
Now, who wants soup?

351
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,710
Next, speak up.

352
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,756
I'm headed over to Elaine's.

353
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,476
Jerry, those are the guys
that mugged me for the armoire.

354
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,511
- Those two? Are you sure?
- That's them.

355
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,157
- Let's confront them.
- No, let's get a cop.

356
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,231
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.

357
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,389
Come on, let's go.

358
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,879
Wow, look,
that one is gorgeous.

359
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,393
I would just kill for that one.

360
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,357
No, not in blue.
Blue does not go at all.

361
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,112
Do you know what
you're talking about?

362
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,431
I don't think you know what you're
talking about. Take a look at that.

363
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,669
Excuse me.

364
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,678
- Are you talking to me?
- Well...

365
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,229
I said, are you talking to me?

366
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,516
Well, maybe he was talking to me.

367
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,874
Was you talking to him?

368
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,996
Because you was
obviously talking to one of us.

369
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,879
So what is it? Who?
Who was you talking to?

370
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,388
We were kind of
talking to each other.

371
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,357
Weren't we?

372
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,192
I mean, you know, I've never been
so insulted in my entire life.

373
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,316
There's something really wrong
with this man.

374
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,357
He is a Soup Nazi.

375
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,636
- What? What is that?
- I don't know.

376
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,631
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushroom...

377
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,439
...half a cup of olive oil,
three pounds of celery...

378
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,079
...chopped parsley..."
- Let me see.

379
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,116
You know what this is?
This is a recipe for soup.

380
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,475
Look at this. There are like
30 different recipes.

381
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,392
These are his recipes.

382
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,152
- So?
- So?

383
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,477
His secret's out. Don't you see?

384
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,790
I could give these
to every restaurant in town.

385
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,234
I could have them published.

386
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,597
I could drop fliers
from a plane above the city.

387
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,478
Wait, where do you think
you're going?

388
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,629
What do you care?

389
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,189
I don't want you causing trouble
down at that soup stand.

390
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,429
I love that soup.

391
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,996
- Get out of my way, Jerry.
- Elaine, let the man make his soup.

392
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,515
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.

393
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,632
Look, they have it in blue.

394
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,279
For my baby bluey.

395
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,989
- Are you my baby bluey?
- Oh, yes, I'm your baby bluey.

396
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,151
Oh, yes.

397
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,233
Well, well.

398
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,437
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey, Susan, George.

399
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,352
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.

400
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,990
Oh, really? Because we're kind of
not seeing each other anymore.

401
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,111
Oh, no, that's too bad.

402
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,840
Yeah, well, she was
very affectionate, which I love.

403
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,274
You know I love that.

404
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,309
But mentally we couldn't quite
make a connection.

405
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,714
- Really?
- Yeah.

406
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,872
Too bad. You gotta have the affection,
which you obviously have.

407
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,231
I think it's great that you're so open
with your affections in public.

408
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,038
See, we had that.

409
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,236
- You did?
- Oh, yes.

410
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,511
But the mental thing...

411
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,432
But, anyway...

412
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,989
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

413
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,748
See you.

414
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,111
Go on, leave. Get out!

415
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,714
- But I didn't do anything.
- Next.

416
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,032
Hello.

417
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,949
You?

418
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,315
You think you can get soup?

419
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,152
Please, you're wasting
everyone's time.

420
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,638
I don't want soup.

421
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,360
I can make my own soup.

422
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,878
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushrooms...

423
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,951
...half a cup of olive oil...

424
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,031
...three pounds celery."

425
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,111
That is my recipe for
wild mushroom.

426
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,234
Yeah, that's right. I got them all.

427
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,039
Cold cucumber,
corn and crab chowder.

428
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,270
- Mulagatani.
- Mulagatani?

429
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,638
You're through, Soup Nazi.
Pack it up.

430
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,350
No more soup for you.

431
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,192
Next!

432
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,795
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!

433
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,871
- What is it?
- Something happened to Soup Nazi.

434
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,429
- What is the matter?
- Elaine's causing a commotion.

435
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,797
She got ahold of his recipes, and she's
gonna drive him out of business.

436
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,758
Now that his recipes are out
he's not gonna make any more soup!

437
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,235
He's moving out of the country!
Moving to Argentina!

438
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,470
No more soup, Jerry.
No more for any of us!

439
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,676
- Where you going?
- He's giving away what's left.

440
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,831
I gotta go home and get a big pot.
