1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,664
As humans, we need training
in social skills...

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,068
...conversational distance.

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,709
Don't you hate these people
that talk into your mouth...

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,072
...like you're a clown
at a drive-through?

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,543
And handshakes is the worst.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,239
There's absolutely no guidelines
for handshakes.

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,544
You know how many people--?
Too strong, too weak.

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,947
Sometimes they give you...

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,248
...the three-quarter handshake,
just the fingers.

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,981
Early release, late release.

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,718
Sometimes people
will dispute your release.

12
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,385
You've let go. They're hanging on.

13
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,294
l have actually said to people,
''Hey, the handshake is over.''

14
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,136
Too many pumps,
coming in too high...

15
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,705
...too sweaty, from too far away.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,810
Sometimes a guy will give you
a strong grip, late release...

17
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,310
...and pull you in for the
too-close conversation.

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,246
To him l say,
''That's three strikes. You're out.''

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,088
You know, the timing
couldn't be worse.

20
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,817
ls there a good time to have
your parents stay with you?

21
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,896
l haven't been together
with Rachel for three weeks.

22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,861
First l was on the road,
then my parents show up.

23
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,161
l'm getting a little backed up.

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,763
-When are they leaving for Paris?
-Not for three days.

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,466
-What about her place?
-She lives with her parents.

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,941
Really?

27
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,673
Maybe this will become, like,
a cool thing, living with your parents.

28
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,646
Then maybe baldness
will catch on.

29
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,446
Things will all be turning your way.

30
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,284
Hey, believe me,
baldness will catch on.

31
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,655
When the aliens come, who do
you think they're gonna relate to?

32
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,195
Who do you think's gonna be
getting tour of the ship?

33
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,059
The baldies.

34
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,667
My parents want your parents
over for dinner.

35
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,134
Good. l get the apartment
for at least one night.

36
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,297
l'm paying for this Paris trip.
lt's their anniversary present.

37
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,034
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Alec.

38
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,701
-Hey, Alec.
-This is Joey.

39
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,211
-Hey, Joey, how are you doing?
-Hey, listen...

40
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,214
...l was wondering if you'd be
interested in doing some work...

41
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,683
...for the Big Brother program.
l'm kind of running the local chapter.

42
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,580
What do you say, George?

43
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,849
-Well<i>....</i>
-Wouldn't you...

44
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,257
...like to be a Big Brother
to someone like me?

45
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,398
Please?

46
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,226
Well...

47
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,935
...sure, Joey, sure.

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,570
l would be thrilled.

49
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,037
That's great. Thanks.
l'll get in touch with you.

50
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,005
Wouldn't you like to be
a Big Brother--?

51
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,644
All right, Joey. That's enough.

52
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,211
Let's go. See you.

53
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,282
-What happened?
-What could l do?

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,475
Did you see the mug on that kid?

55
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,954
Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup
to someone like me?

56
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,157
Please?

57
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,990
Have you noticed they moved...

58
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,958
...where they do the interview
on <i>Jeopardy</i>?

59
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,188
Yeah. lt was in the middle
of Single Jeopardy.

60
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,357
-Now it's after Single Jeopardy.
-Yeah. lt's much better, isn't it?

61
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,832
Oh, no comparison.

62
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,904
l gotta get my parents one
of those French-English dictionaries.

63
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,373
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What?

64
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,738
Your parents are going
to Paris, right?

65
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,244
-Yeah.
-So l tell Alec...

66
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,440
...that l have to go to Paris
for an undetermined amount of time.

67
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,585
Then all l have to do
is buy postcards...

68
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,278
...and have your parents
mail them from Paris.

69
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,923
-What about little Joey?
-Who?

70
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,926
-He's probably better off.
-Yeah.

71
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,224
l'm trying to get out
of this Big Brother program.

72
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,128
When you get to Paris,
drop them in any mailbox.

73
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,260
-But there are no stamps on these.
-You gotta buy French stamps.

74
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,837
l'll reimburse you, of course.

75
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,372
Why are you doing this?

76
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,339
He wants this guy
to think he's in Paris.

77
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,739
-Why?
-Because George...

78
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,743
...is a deeply disturbed individual.

79
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,352
Oh, hey, Helen. Could l use
some more of your hand lotion?

80
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,479
l told you it was good. lt's from
the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.

81
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,419
l'll remember that
if l'm ever in Florida.

82
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,119
Yeah, or if ever on Fifth Avenue
here in New York City.

83
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,991
-You can get some there.
-Yeah?

84
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,259
Say, those are nice pants.
l got a pair just like them at home.

85
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,699
That doesn't surprise me.
l bought these at Rudy's.

86
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,601
lt's a used clothing store.
See, when people like you die...

87
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,208
...the widows,
they bring in their wardrobes.

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,470
-They make a bundle.
-Really?

89
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,683
My father's got a ton of old clothes
just sitting up in the attic.

90
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,318
-You think they're worth something?
-lf they're vintage.

91
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,919
And you're a widow.

92
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,919
What happens if the husband dies
after the wife?

93
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,527
-Who brings the clothing in then?
-l suppose the children do.

94
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,963
Yes, l suppose they do.

95
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,791
All right. l got a 1 0:00.
l'll see everybody later.

96
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,375
Hey, l just remembered...

97
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,515
...my parents wanna have you
over for dinner before you leave.

98
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,674
-What about tonight?
-Tonight?

99
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,649
Yeah. They're making paella.

100
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,881
l don't think we can make it tonight.
We have plans.

101
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,617
-What plans?
-We have plans.

102
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,787
-Where did you get plans?
-We have plans.

103
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,825
-Well, what about tomorrow night?
-Maybe.

104
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,769
Okay...

105
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,666
-...l guess l'll tell them that.
-Okay.

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,174
-Hey, give them our best, though.
-Yeah.

107
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,310
-l'll call you later.
-Yeah.

108
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,344
-So, what plans do you have?
-None.

109
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,884
So how come you're not
going over there for dinner?

110
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,148
Jerry, we don't care much
for the Costanzas.

111
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,588
We can't stand them.

112
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,793
-Really? Since when?
-Since always.

113
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,226
-We've never liked them.
-Why?

114
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,457
Well, they're so loud.
They're always fighting.

115
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,295
lt's uncomfortable.
You never noticed?

116
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,334
l noticed. But they're
from your age group.

117
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,028
l didn't think you could detect...

118
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,106
...abnormal behavior
among your own kind.

119
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,606
Well, we do.

120
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,443
-Yeah?
-<i>It's us.</i>

121
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,412
Oh, come on up.

122
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,521
-lt's Elaine. You have any problem?
-We adore Elaine.

123
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,054
-She's with her new boyfriend.
-What's he like?

124
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,784
-He's nice. A bit of a close talker.
-A what?

125
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,224
You'll see.

126
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,456
l really had no idea that you felt
this way about the Costanzas.

127
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,795
They're exhausting.
lt's like being in an asylum.

128
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,433
-Hi.
-Hi.

129
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,129
-There she is.
-Hello, Elaine.

130
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,639
Hi, Mrs. Seinfeld.

131
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,640
Oh, this is Aaron.

132
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,472
-Hello, Aaron.
-Hello.

133
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,443
How long are you folks in town?

134
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:28,144
Three more days. Three more days,
and then we're off to Paris.

135
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,619
We're going with a select
charter group.

136
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,315
l love France.
l was just there last year.

137
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,858
ln fact...

138
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,393
...you know, l still have
an envelope full of French francs.

139
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,190
l'll give them to you.

140
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,999
We can't take money.

141
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,069
No. lt's a gift. From us.

142
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,730
Oh, that is so nice, Aaron.

143
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,341
lsn't he nice?

144
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,569
Has Jerry been
showing you a good time?

145
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,474
No, l haven't.

146
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,672
You know, l have a friend...

147
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,182
...who works at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

148
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,217
How'd you like
a behind-the-scenes tour?

149
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,687
-Really? You could do that?
-Easily.

150
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,792
-lt wouldn't be any trouble?
-Of course not.

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,360
-When could we go?
-How about right now?

152
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,293
-l'm ready.
-Are you sure?

153
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,695
-Yes!
-Okay, let me get my coat.

154
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,028
Elaine, what do you say?

155
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,433
Well, l don't think so, Aaron.

156
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,065
l have plans.

157
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,271
How about you, Jerry?

158
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,106
l'm swamped.

159
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,772
You sure? You can examine
the artwork up close.

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,711
Maybe l'll try and catch up with you.

161
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,384
Yeah, that will happen.

162
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,019
All right. We're off.

163
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,452
-Okay. Bye.
-Let's go.

164
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,353
Okay. Bye-bye.
Have a good time.

165
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,754
-Bye.
-See everybody later.

166
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,862
-Okay.
-Bye.

167
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,692
Why would he ask your parents
to go to a museum?

168
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,458
-l don't know.
-What is that?

169
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,534
Maybe he was just trying
to be nice.

170
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,365
Have you ever heard of anyone
doing anything like this?

171
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,599
Wait a second.
He just did me a big favor.

172
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,006
-What?
-He got them out of the house.

173
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,169
-What?
-l can call Rachel.

174
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,510
Oh, no. l got the machine.

175
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,616
Rachel are you there? l got
the place to myself for a few hours.

176
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,913
Rachel, where are you?

177
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,055
Rachel!

178
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,893
Sorry, pal. Wish l could
help you out.

179
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,198
-They're not coming?
-No. They had plans.

180
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,595
How could they have plans?

181
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,326
What difference does it make?

182
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,732
They wouldn't lie to us.

183
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,339
-They're our dear friends.
-What am l supposed to do...

184
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,840
-...with all this paella?
-They said tomorrow, maybe.

185
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,035
-Maybe?
-Maybe they don't like us.

186
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,146
Why wouldn't they like us?

187
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,552
Again with the pepper? What do
you gotta use all that pepper for?

188
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,917
-Keep quiet.
-You trying to set my mouth on fire?

189
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,084
l don't know what
the reason could be.

190
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,760
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

191
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,264
What a day.

192
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,403
Jerry, you would not believe
the time we had.

193
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,198
Aaron is quite the tour guide.

194
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,739
Have you ever seen
those lmpressionist paintings?

195
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,969
-Oh, sure, like Monet.
-Don't you think he had to be...

196
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,943
...nearsighted? Nobody would
paint like that if they could see.

197
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,605
lt's all out of focus.

198
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,842
He's from the lmpressionist school,
you know...

199
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,988
...like Monet, Manet,
Tippy-tippy-day-day.

200
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,885
l say that guy was painting
without his glasses.

201
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,857
Hello. Rachel.

202
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,961
Yeah.

203
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,291
No. They're back.

204
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,133
Jerry if you have something to do,
we can just sit right here and read.

205
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,434
Yes. Well...

206
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,941
...l'm sorry too.
Listen, l'll call you later.

207
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,903
Okay. Bye.

208
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,604
Well, l should be going.

209
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,579
Oh, thanks again.

210
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,047
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

211
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,016
-Hey.
-Oh, you must be Kramer.

212
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,122
l've heard about you.

213
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,853
Hey, you must be Aaron.
l've heard about you.

214
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,690
-Well, see you later.
-Yeah.

215
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,196
-Bye.
-Okay.

216
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,702
So, what are you guys
doing for dinner?

217
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,341
-We have no plans.
-Look at that, Helen.

218
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,103
Do you see what he's wearing?
That's the Executive.

219
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,611
-What is the Executive?
-The beltless trench coat.

220
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,715
-My father invented it.
-l sure did.

221
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,977
Raincoats were my business.
The Executive was a classic.

222
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,144
These haven't been made
in 20 years.

223
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,290
Why would they?
Nobody bought them then.

224
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,186
-He's wearing one.
-These are a hot item at Rudy's.

225
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,852
You don't say.

226
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,430
You know, l have boxes of those
sitting in my garage in Florida.

227
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,862
Get them up here.

228
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,730
You give me 25 percent,
l'll take care of everything.

229
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,134
-You got a deal.
-Yeah.

230
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,037
This is like the meeting
of Smith and Wesson.

231
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,674
l'll call Jack Klompus.
He's got a key to the garage.

232
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,579
-He can send them overnight delivery.
-You're gonna start shipping boxes?

233
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,085
-We're leaving for Paris in three days.
-He'll send them express.

234
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,985
-You're crazy.
-l'll tell you how crazy l am.

235
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,023
l'm paying for this trip
with these coats.

236
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,753
-l'm paying for the trip.
-So much the better.

237
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,465
Anyway, it's kind of a fluke thing...

238
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,627
...but l'll be leaving for Paris
in two days.

239
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,934
l will send you a postcard
when l get there.

240
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,941
-Paris, huh?
-Yeah.

241
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,138
You know, l feel terrible about Joey,
but it's a great business opportunity.

242
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,545
l don't even know how long
l'm gonna be away.

243
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,885
Where will you stay?

244
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,213
An apartment complex. The<i>....</i>

245
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,556
The Eiffel Towers.

246
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,660
Like l said, you'll be getting
a postcard in a few days...

247
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,525
...and again, l'm sorry.

248
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,269
George, you have no idea
how fantastic this is.

249
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,227
-Fantastic?
-Yeah.

250
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,164
We've been trying to reunite
Joey with his father...

251
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,603
...who lives in Paris.

252
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,005
But he's afraid to fly alone.
You know, he's kind of withdrawn...

253
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,944
...but he seems to take to you.

254
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:02,617
-So it's a perfect solution.
-Gee, what a coincidence.

255
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,147
And you'll send me a postcard.

256
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,792
Helen really seemed
to respond to Renoir.

257
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,665
l think she really connected
with the way he painted children.

258
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,397
And that Morty.

259
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,705
l'll tell you, that old guy's full of life.

260
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,542
He was convinced
Monet was nearsighted.

261
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,373
-l kept telling him--
-Aaron?

262
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,814
Yes?

263
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,611
Let me ask you a question.

264
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,215
How come you asked
Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld...

265
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,822
...to go to the museum with you?

266
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:43,527
Well, they were in from out of town.
l thought they'd enjoy it.

267
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,623
You didn't feel uncomfortable...

268
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,167
...spending the whole
day at the museum...

269
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,170
...with two complete strangers
who are more than twice your age?

270
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,830
No.

271
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,338
lt was fun.

272
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,538
You had fun
with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld?

273
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,046
Yeah.

274
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,075
They bought me a Coke.

275
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,557
How'd you get the idea
for the beltless trench coat?

276
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,253
l came home one night,
and l tripped over one of Jerry's toys.

277
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,299
So l took out my belt,
just to threaten him...

278
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,492
...and l got a glimpse
of myself in the mirror.

279
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,398
-How serendipitous.
-So that night, l cut off the loops...

280
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,207
...and the Executive was born.

281
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,279
He also had an idea
for a brimless rain hat...

282
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,381
...but that never materialized.

283
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,074
All right, come on. Let's play.

284
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,015
-Did you call Jack Klompus?
-l haven't been able to reach him.

285
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,416
l'll call him right now.

286
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,113
-Oh, come on.
-Just a second.

287
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,485
Jerry, have you seen
<i>Schindler's List</i>?

288
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,594
-No, l haven't seen it yet.
-You have to go.

289
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,059
-l'm going.
-You have to.

290
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,527
Okay.

291
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,328
-Hello, Jack?
-<i>Yeah?</i>

292
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,435
-Jack, it's Morty.
-Who died?

293
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,507
Nobody died. Jack, l want you
to do me a big favor.

294
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,168
-ln my garage are a couple of boxes.
-What boxes?

295
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,041
-l'm gonna explain what boxes.
-All right. How the hell do l know?

296
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,183
Anyway, there are
these three big boxes...

297
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,252
...you can't miss them, l want you
to ship them here to New York.

298
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,048
l thought you were going to Paris.

299
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,713
l'm still going to Paris.

300
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,688
l got a big deal cooking here.

301
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,393
-What's in the boxes?
-Raincoats.

302
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,824
Raincoats?

303
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,023
You think you're gonna sell
those old crappy raincoats?

304
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,428
That's garbage.

305
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,765
l guarantee you, Doris won't let him
mail those boxes.

306
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,304
-When do you want these?
-Send them tomorrow.

307
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,508
So you think
they're coming tonight?

308
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,612
l don't know. They said maybe.

309
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,941
Of course they're coming.
They're leaving soon.

310
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,051
-lf they don't come, they won't see us.
-Well, they better come.

311
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,811
l got all this paella.

312
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,715
l admire Morty and Helen
going to France.

313
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,655
We should take a trip.

314
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,492
Maybe a cruise.

315
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,627
Yes, a cruise.

316
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,629
A long cruise.

317
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,062
Just the two of you.

318
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,898
Georgie, what were you doing
poking around the attic last night?

319
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,938
-l wasn't in the attic.
-l heard noise.

320
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,478
-Maybe it was a mouse.
-Okay, that's it! We're moving!

321
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,642
-What?
-l will not tolerate infestation.

322
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,846
You haven't even seen one.

323
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,049
Don't you understand?
The very thought, the very idea.

324
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,955
l'll never be comfortable again.

325
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,857
All right, Frank. That's enough.

326
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,696
l guess l've been hanging
onto them for so long...

327
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,337
...because l couldn't accept the fact
that Dad was really gone forever.

328
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,073
They will get a good home,
won't they?

329
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,717
l gotta be honest, there's nothing
here too spectacular.

330
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,648
Oh, l beg to differ.

331
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,715
My father took great pride
in his appearance.

332
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,119
He was a very handsome man,
a Casanova, really.

333
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,659
l'll give you $200
for the three boxes.

334
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,229
Could you make it 225?
That was his high game in bowling.

335
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,532
Yeah, l'm in a good mood. Here.

336
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,337
Thank you.

337
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,564
Hey, George.
What are you doing here?

338
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,413
l'm just selling some of Dad's things.
That's what he would have wanted.

339
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,480
Oh, l got you.

340
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,241
-That'll do.
-Hey, guess what.

341
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,717
Morty Seinfeld and l are going into
business together, selling raincoats.

342
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,652
-That's swell.
-We worked it out...

343
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,554
-...all over dinner last night.
-Dinner?

344
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,522
-You had dinner with the Seinfelds?
-Yeah, last night.

345
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,594
Was this something
you had planned?

346
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,563
No, it was spur of the moment.

347
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,895
Well, you know Morty. He likes to fly
by the seat of his vintage pants.

348
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,071
They had plans, huh?
They had plans!

349
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,269
Boy, l've never seen these before.
They just came in.

350
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,971
Part of my springtime
cruise collection.

351
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,483
-Two for $25.
-Oh, l'll take these. Yeah.

352
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,451
Hey, remember this raincoat
that you sold me?

353
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,021
Sure. That's the Executive.

354
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,091
-Do you have any others?
-l wish. They don't make it anymore.

355
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,420
Suppose l told you l have 50
in mint condition. You interested?

356
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,792
-Very interested.
-They're coming in from Florida.

357
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,558
-Bring them in.
-So you'll buy them?

358
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,793
l don't see what would
possibly stop me?

359
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,278
They had plans, huh?
They were busy.

360
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,115
They were busy
with their big plans, huh?

361
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,655
-What are you talking about?
-Mom and Pop Seinfeld.

362
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,316
-Look, l don't know.
-l know what they did last night.

363
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,258
-They had dinner with Kramer.
-lt was a last-minute thing.

364
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,126
They won't have dinner
with my parents?

365
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,096
-Right.
-Something wrong with my parents?

366
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,600
-Absolutely.
-My parents are wonderful people.

367
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,102
-These the same people you live with?
-Yes.

368
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,011
-Are they coming tonight or not?
-l don't know what their plans are.

369
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,647
Okay. Fine.

370
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,338
lt's gonna be very interesting...

371
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,617
...very interesting
if they don't show up tonight.

372
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,448
You know, my mother
made all this paella.

373
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,522
What is that, anyway?

374
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,624
lt's a Spanish dish.

375
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,556
lt's a mélange of fish
and meat with rice.

376
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,787
-Very tasty.
-l'll tell them.

377
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,263
-Could you do one other thing for me?
-Name it.

378
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,626
Would your parents
have any objections...

379
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,033
...to taking a little kid
to Paris with them?

380
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,541
lt turns out that the kid's father
lives in Paris.

381
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,306
ls that a coincidence?

382
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,043
You know, Alec wants me
to take him over there...

383
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,380
...so l figure as long
as they're going--

384
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,648
You thought as long as
they're mailing postcards...

385
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,089
...it wouldn't be too much
to ask my parents to drag a child...

386
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,355
...who they've never seen
through the streets of Paris?

387
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,601
lf you think it's too much,
they don't have to mail the postcards.

388
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,371
So where's he taking you?

389
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,601
Well, first we're going to a matinee.
l'm taking the afternoon off.

390
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,438
We're gonna go see <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

391
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,908
And then we're gonna
go to dinner.

392
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,881
-He knows all these fantastic places.
-You are one lucky girl.

393
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,318
Wish l could find a nice guy.

394
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,522
-Hi, Aaron.
-Hey, Joanne.

395
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,488
-Hey.
-Hi.

396
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,565
-Hello, hello.
-Hello, Elaine.

397
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,367
l was able to finagle
two more tickets to <i>My Fair Lady...</i>

398
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,534
...and l thought, why not ask
Morty and Helen?

399
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,046
-Great.
-This is some office.

400
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,875
What's the square footage?

401
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:49,118
-You don't mind, do you, Elaine?
-Mind? Oh, of course not.

402
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,586
We can make a whole day of it.

403
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,247
This is some building.

404
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,620
Harry Fleming used to have
an office here.

405
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,285
There was a deli on the first floor.

406
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,931
You don't get corned beef
like that anymore.

407
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,095
What happened to that deli?

408
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,928
l really don't know, Mr. Seinfeld.

409
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,614
We better not.

410
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,847
They're gonna be here
any second.

411
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,386
When are they leaving?

412
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,319
ln two days.

413
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,494
-lt's been so long.
-l know.

414
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,425
Okay.

415
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,133
-lt's only two more days.
-Right.

416
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,199
Thursday, 3:00.

417
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,110
-Oh, hi.
-We didn't know you had company.

418
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,144
Yeah. This is Rachel.

419
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,872
-Hi.
-Hello, Rachel.

420
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,313
-We'll come back another time.
-What other time?

421
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,952
-Whenever.
-Where you going?

422
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,850
-We'll drive around for a while.
-You don't have a car.

423
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,014
-We'll take a bus.
-Come on. Stop.

424
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,783
-No, we don't mind.
-l'll get a book.

425
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,326
No, it's okay.
l was just leaving anyway.

426
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,589
Are you sure?
Because we don't wanna--

427
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,130
No, it's okay.

428
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,734
-We'll go see <i>Schindler's List</i>, right?
-Definitely.

429
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,300
Okay.

430
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,006
-lt was nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you.

431
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,800
-See you later.
-Bye-bye.

432
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,908
Boy, that was some show.

433
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,272
-What show?
-<i>My Fair Lady.</i>

434
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,280
-When did you get tickets to see that?
-Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.

435
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,385
Oh, Elaine? Really?

436
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,646
Well, that sounds interesting.

437
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,689
We saw Regis Philbin
get out of a limousine.

438
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,688
He looks better on TV.

439
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,832
-Hello.
-Hello, Jerry.

440
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,195
-Yeah?
-lt's Jack Klompus.

441
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,996
Oh, hi, Jack.

442
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,839
So when are you coming down
to Florida again?

443
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,033
As soon as is humanly possible.

444
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,339
You know, l still got that pen,
the one that writes upside down.

445
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,574
Yeah. l should have kept it.

446
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,719
-So where's your father?
-Oh, he's right here.

447
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,719
-Yeah?
-<i>Hello, Morty.</i>

448
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,387
Listen, l can't get in the garage.

449
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,620
-<i>What do you mean?</i>
-There is something...

450
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,094
...wrong with the key.
The key doesn't work.

451
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,825
-You gotta jiggle it a little bit.
-l jiggled it.

452
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,162
l jiggled it for 1 5 minutes.

453
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,828
Tell him to come down here
and get his own packages.

454
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,600
You have nothing better to do
than worry about his boxes?

455
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,641
You gotta pull on the knob
as you turn it.

456
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,540
Get the hell out of here
with your knob!

457
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,112
What does he want from you?

458
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,374
My idiot son could open
that garage door.

459
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,412
What did l do?

460
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,020
Just do it first thing tomorrow.
l need it.

461
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,748
They'll be here first thing
Thursday morning.

462
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,792
Thursday morning?
You know we're leaving at 3:00.

463
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,055
Yeah, you're leaving at 3:00.

464
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,597
-How will you get this done?
-Don't worry about it.

465
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,201
Yeah, how you gonna get
all this done in time?

466
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,404
They were drinking
champagne in a buggy!

467
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,132
-First Kramer, then Elaine?
-Yeah.

468
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,902
-lt's a slap in the face.
-What did we ever do to them?

469
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,980
l wanna know what we did to them.

470
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,640
What are they, too good for us?
A raincoat salesman.

471
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,946
-l could buy and sell him, like that.
-The hell with them!

472
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,613
The thing that bothers me the most
is the lying.

473
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,025
Well, let's forget about it.

474
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,856
We're going on a beautiful vacation.

475
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,427
Vacation?

476
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,590
Your mother and l are planning
on taking a cruise.

477
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,761
But l can't find any
of my vacation clothes.

478
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,372
They were in the attic.

479
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,472
The attic?

480
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,075
You haven't worn any
of those clothes for years.

481
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,213
How can l go on a cruise
without my cabana-wear?

482
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,350
l love those clothes.

483
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,382
A mouse! l saw a mouse!

484
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,354
lt's the remote.

485
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,656
Where the hell are my clothes?
l love those clothes.

486
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,396
Lousy, moth-ridden crap.

487
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,768
l'm not crazy about used clothes.
l mean, they call it vintage...

488
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,534
...you know, to take your mind
off what it really is, nasty-wear.

489
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,912
Oh, it's clean, you know.
People wear underwear.

490
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,240
Yeah, well, they don't
wear iron underwear.

491
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,316
And that's what it's gonna take
to get me in those clothes.

492
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,716
l'll move into an apartment
after a strange person moves out.

493
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,584
Why would l wanna move
into somebody's pants?

494
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,453
There is no vintage underwear,
of course.

495
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,186
But it's not because a guy
couldn't sell his underwear.

496
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,195
lt's because men
wear their underwear...

497
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,994
...until it absolutely disintegrates.

498
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:08,332
Men hang onto underwear
until each individual...

499
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,805
...underwear molecule
is so strained...

500
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,467
...it can barely retain
the properties of a solid.

501
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,738
lt actually becomes
underwear vapor.

502
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,416
We don't even throw it out.
We just open a window...

503
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,677
...and it goes out
like dandelion spores.

504
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,720
That's how men throw out underwear.
We go-- Then it's gone.

505
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,653
That's it. lt's just<i>....</i>

506
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,893
-Hey, Jerry.
-So how was the movie?

507
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,757
Oh, really good. Really good.

508
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,296
-Didn't three hours go by like that?
-Like that.

509
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,766
What about the end, with the list?

510
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,568
Yeah, that was some list.

511
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,105
What'd you think
of the black and white?

512
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,333
The black and white?

513
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,704
The whole movie
was in black and white.

514
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,907
Oh, yeah, l didn't even realize.

515
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,685
You don't think about it.
There's so much going on.

516
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,789
Yeah. Yeah. l tell you,
l could see it again.

517
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,658
So Klompus has the key,
but the jerk couldn't open it up.

518
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,324
All you gotta do is jiggle it. You just
get it in there, jiggle it, jiggle it.

519
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,197
Look, l find this whole thing
very uninteresting.

520
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:50,068
-When you get the coats, come in.
-Oh, yeah. Hey, l'm on your side.

521
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,708
Hey. What, again?

522
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,071
l'm trying to buy some
of the clothes back.

523
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,179
Hey, wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

524
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,111
My mother made
all this extra paella.

525
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,978
Paella? Yeah, l'll be there.

526
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,985
Apparently, the Seinfelds
are too good for us.

527
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,622
l shouldn't say anything bad
about your partner.

528
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,726
No, no. We're not really partners.
l only get 25 percent.

529
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,793
Twenty-five percent?
lt was your idea.

530
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,797
-Yeah, l know.
-You're doing all the legwork.

531
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,958
-That's right.
-He's ripping you off.

532
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,537
-You're right. He's ripping me off.
-You should be getting more.

533
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,971
-He's ripping me off.
-Don't let him take advantage of you.

534
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,047
Oh, it's you.

535
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,740
You're the one who sold me
the moth-ridden cabana crap.

536
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,922
You know, l've been thinking...

537
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,216
...why is Kramer getting 25 percent?

538
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,053
Well, he told you about the place.

539
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,058
So what?
Why is that worth 25 percent?

540
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,925
lt's a finder's fee.
You know what a finder's fee is?

541
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,066
You find something, you get a fee.

542
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,361
A finder's fee is 1 0 percent,
no more.

543
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,060
Well, it's too late now.

544
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,430
Those are my coats.
l saved them, l stored them.

545
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,337
l've been waiting years
for this payoff.

546
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,910
Well, you're not gonna say anything.

547
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,603
Hey.

548
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,116
-l've been thinking about something.
-Yeah, so have l--

549
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,946
-l don't think the deal is fair.
-You don't think it's fair?

550
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,748
No, no. l found the place.
l set the whole thing up.

551
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,118
-l'm doing all the legwork.
-What legwork?

552
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,988
-There's legwork.
-lf anything, you're getting too much.

553
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,357
-Too much?
-That's right. They're my coats.

554
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,896
Okay, look, l want 35 percent.

555
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,533
l'm thinking more like 1 5.

556
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,135
-No way l'm taking 1 5.
-Well, you're not getting 35!

557
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,135
All right, let's compromise.

558
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,534
-Twenty-five percent.
-Okay, it's a deal.

559
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,711
Moths are the scourge of my business.
All it takes is one moth to lay eggs.

560
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,475
Know what happens to the larvae?
They hatch everywhere.

561
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,050
Well, l'm sorry.

562
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,619
Here's your money back.
And l'll take the clothes.

563
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,450
This will hardly put a dent
in my fumigation bill.

564
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,889
-So where are the clothes?
-l burned them.

565
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,996
That's good.

566
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,890
Now, l know they're
your parents, Jerry...

567
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,660
...and they're very nice people.

568
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,966
But don't you think it's odd...

569
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,973
...that a 35-year-old man
is going to these lengths...

570
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,010
...to see that someone else's parents
are enjoying themselves?

571
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,511
l mean, don't you
find that abnormal?

572
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,377
lt is a tad askew.

573
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,054
l mean, they're your parents,
and you don't do anything.

574
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,519
Why's this stranger doing it?

575
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,157
l've hardly been out with them.

576
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,623
See? See?
And l can't even say anything...

577
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,456
...you know, because
all he's really doing is being nice...

578
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,258
...but nobody's this nice.
This is, like...

579
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:32,027
-...certifiably nice.
-You're right. He's insane.

580
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,263
Yes, he's insane.
That's what l think.

581
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,538
-So, what are you gonna do?
-l don't know.

582
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,438
l don't know what to do.

583
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,474
Oh, God. So how was the movie?

584
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,707
From what l saw, it was pretty good.

585
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,578
What do you mean,
''from what you saw''?

586
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,381
Well, l didn't actually get
to see the whole movie.

587
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,047
Yeah, why not?

588
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,953
l was kind of making out.

589
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,269
You were making out
during <i>Schindler's List</i>?

590
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,869
l couldn't help it.

591
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,904
We hadn't been alone in a long time.
lt got the better of me.

592
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,373
-During <i>Schindler's List</i>?
-We're both living with our parents.

593
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,240
Did anybody see you
or say anything?

594
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,439
Oh, l don't think so.
l saw Newman, but he didn't see me.

595
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,420
Hello, Mrs. Seinfeld.

596
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,657
Hello, Newman.

597
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,032
Jerry's not here.

598
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,760
Having a nice trip?

599
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,272
Wonderful. We went to
the theater last night.

600
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,170
Oh, the theater.

601
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,106
-Because l was wondering--
-Wondering what?

602
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,679
Why l didn't see you
at <i>Schindler's List</i> with Jerry.

603
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,077
Well, we already saw it.

604
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,845
Oh, well, it's a good thing
for Jerry that you didn't go.

605
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,180
-Why is that?
-Well, he really seemed to have...

606
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,518
...his hands full,
if you know what l mean?

607
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,193
l'm afraid l don't.

608
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,295
Him and his buxom little friend,
Rachel...

609
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,556
...were going at it pretty good
in the balcony.

610
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,723
-What?
-Do l have to spell it out for you?

611
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,530
He was moving on her
like the stormtroopers into Poland.

612
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,700
Jerry was necking
during <i>Schindler's List</i>?

613
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,103
Yes.

614
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,575
And a more offensive spectacle
l cannot recall.

615
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,341
Anyway, l just really came up
to get some detergent.

616
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,417
-Jerry sends his laundry out.
-Oh, right.

617
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,987
Well, it was nice seeing you folks.
Oh, by the way...

618
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,421
...you didn't hear this from me.
Ta-ta.

619
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,765
Hi.

620
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,404
-What? What did l do?
-How could you?

621
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,842
-How could l what?
-You were making out...

622
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,845
...during <i>Schindler's List</i>?

623
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,547
What?

624
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,151
-No.
-Don't lie, Jerry.

625
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,978
Newman.

626
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,324
-How could you do such a thing?
-l couldn't help it.

627
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,123
We hadn't been alone together
in a long time.

628
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,732
We started up a little
during the coming attractions...

629
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,131
...and the next thing we knew
the war was over.

630
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,000
-Hello.
-<i>Jerry.</i>

631
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,144
-lt's Jack Klompus.
-Hang on a second.

632
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,406
Dad, it's Klompus.

633
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,516
-Hello.
-<i>Hello, Morty?</i>

634
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,787
Listen. That key doesn't work.

635
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,549
-lt's no good.
-You didn't get in?

636
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,091
Oh, l got in.
l had to break the window with a rock.

637
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,526
And then l got my hand
all cut up reaching in.

638
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,894
-You broke the window?
-He broke the window?

639
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,127
You wanted those damn boxes,
didn't you?

640
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,534
He should be on his hands
and knees thanking you.

641
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,174
-Did you send them?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

642
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,539
They'll be there
tomorrow afternoon, 2:00.

643
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,236
Tomorrow afternoon?

644
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,813
-Tomorrow afternoon?
-Tomorrow afternoon?

645
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,814
l told you to send them express.

646
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,386
lt was $ 1 0 cheaper
in the afternoon than the morning.

647
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,386
l figured, what the hell's
the difference?

648
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,049
-What did you do about the window?
-l gotta fix your window now?

649
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,922
All right, all right. Goodbye.

650
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,392
l don't think we'll make that flight.

651
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,261
What do you mean
you won't make it?

652
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,868
We have to make the flight.
We're with a charter group.

653
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,334
lf we don't, the trip is off.

654
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,700
What's the difference?
We'll go someplace else.

655
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,739
Someplace else?
What about Paris?

656
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,242
You don't understand.
l've come this far. l can't stop now.

657
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,213
l can't believe that you're doing all this
just to sell some stupid raincoats.

658
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,783
You don't understand.

659
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,352
Fashion is cyclical.
This thing could come back.

660
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,182
l think you're out of your mind.

661
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:51,093
l just don't understand
how all those clothes can disappear.

662
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,663
-Moths?
-Moths ate three boxes?

663
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,130
Well, you know what happens
when larvae hatch.

664
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,791
They're everywhere.

665
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,800
You know, l was thinking today.

666
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,668
l never liked
those Seinfelds anyway.

667
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,605
He's an idiot altogether.

668
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,806
-Oh, there's Kramer.
-Hello!

669
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,710
Hello!

670
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,416
Hey.

671
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,955
-Good evening.
-Hope you're hungry.

672
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,351
Paella.

673
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,993
-Here, let me take your coat.
-Oh, yeah. Thanks, buddy.

674
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,426
-Hey.
-That shirt.

675
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,257
-Where did you get that shirt?
-What?

676
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,797
That's my cabana shirt.

677
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,957
You stole my shirt,
you son of a bitch!

678
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,899
George, your friends up in the attic,
stealing my clothes!

679
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,836
Give me that back.
Give me that. Give me.

680
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,967
l bought it from Rudy.

681
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,442
Rudy! That skunk!

682
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,047
-l knew he didn't burn those clothes!
-Who's Rudy?

683
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,514
-What clothes?
-l sold your clothes yesterday.

684
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,913
You sold my clothes?

685
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,214
What do you mean,
you sold my clothes?

686
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,086
-l didn't think you wore them anymore.
-lt's cruise-wear!

687
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,192
Kramer.

688
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,623
-l love that shirt.
-Oh, yeah.

689
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,662
That's because it's mine!

690
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,824
You look just like Frank...

691
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,401
...on our honeymoon.

692
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,333
Well, thank you.

693
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,235
-Who's this Rudy?
-Rudy's the guy...

694
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,773
...buying Morty's raincoats.

695
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,808
Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.

696
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,378
The whole deal's
going down tomorrow.

697
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,175
-Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
-Missing his plane?

698
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,477
-Wasn't that a charter flight?
-Yeah.

699
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,485
What happens to charter tickets
when you don't use them?

700
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,486
Well, l suppose they're wasted.

701
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,818
Yes, l suppose they are.

702
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,927
Tomorrow l'm going straight down
to this Rudy and get my clothes.

703
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,723
-A mouse!
-Egad! A mouse!

704
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,162
ln the bedroom!

705
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,941
-You want the tickets?
-Yes.

706
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,081
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?

707
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,616
l get a free trip to Paris.
l go in the Big Brothers' Hall of Fame.

708
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,013
l mail my own postcards.

709
00:35:56,187 --> 00:36:00,317
-You know l'm paying for these tickets.
-lt's all right. l got lunch.

710
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,158
You should've gone
to the Costanzas' for dinner.

711
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,497
The paella was magnificent.

712
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,362
Have you ever had
really good paella?

713
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,370
-Not really.
-lt's an orgiastic feast for the senses...

714
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,408
...a wanton festival of sights,
sounds and colors and<i>....</i>

715
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,446
Dad, you sure we're at
the right carousel?

716
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,605
-This is it.
-So how much are we gonna make?

717
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,616
Take it easy. l've been through
a million of these negotiations.

718
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,083
Two thousand? Three thousand?

719
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,552
That's giving it away.
This is a one-of-a-kind item.

720
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,181
-More? More than 3000?
-Just watch me do my thing.

721
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,355
-Say, Dad, isn't that one of yours?
-Look at this.

722
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,192
Look how this idiot packed it.

723
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,391
He didn't tape it.
He just flipped the flaps.

724
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,196
Wait. Hold it.

725
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,537
Kramer, you missed a couple.

726
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,039
<i>Bonjour</i>, welcome to
the Gateway to Paris charter flight.

727
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,802
Dad, isn't that your charter group?

728
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,738
Honesty. Hard work.

729
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,380
These are the values
that l was raised with.

730
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,074
The most important thing, Joey...

731
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,153
...is to be able to look yourself
in the mirror before you sleep.

732
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,153
Hey, l got news for you, four-eyes...

733
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,157
...there's no way you're staying
with us in Paris.

734
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,758
You burned them?
Those clothes are not yours to burn.

735
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,629
-Who are you, anyways?
-l'm the father.

736
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,397
-He said his father was dead.
-He said l was dead?

737
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,564
That's right.
Squeezed an extra $25 out of me.

738
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,309
That's what my life
is worth to him, $25?

739
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,571
-Hey, Frank!
-Oh, hey.

740
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,648
l want you to know that
l'm retracting our dinner invitation.

741
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,751
You don't have to retract it.
We never went.

742
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,149
l'm retracting that
it was ever offered.

743
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,084
l retract your retraction.

744
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,555
What are you, trying to unload
some junk of yours?

745
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,320
Will you excuse me, please?
We're conducting business here.

746
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,960
Keep them. l'm not interested.

747
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,860
-l thought we had a deal?
-That's another one of my shirts!

748
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,160
Not buying any more clothes
from anyone off the street.

749
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,633
The street?
l'm in the raincoat business 35 years.

750
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:57,240
-Maybe they have moths, like his stuff.
-My clothes don't have moths!

751
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,968
Because of his moths,
you're not buying my raincoats?

752
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,602
-That's right.
-l'm all ticklish.

753
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,679
<i>Flight 433 now boarding</i>
<i>for Miami at gate 1 8-A.</i>

754
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,520
-<i>Flight 433 now boarding.</i>
-Okay. Let's go.

755
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,662
lt was so nice of you to come
to the airport to see us off.

756
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,898
Are you sure you can't stay
a little longer?

757
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,829
-No!
-No!

758
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,229
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.

759
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,893
-Take care.
-Okay, Jer.

760
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,164
-Bye-bye, Elaine.
-Bye-bye.

761
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,068
We'll call you when we get home.

762
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,941
Thank you.

763
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,704
l think she meant me, but<i>....</i>

764
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,912
Make sure Kramer uses good tape
to send back the raincoats.

765
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,915
-Okay.
-Bye.

766
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,418
-Bye.
-Aaron?

767
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,488
Aaron, are you okay?

768
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,284
l could've done more.

769
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,323
l could've done so much more.

770
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,596
-You did enough.
-No.

771
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,629
l could've called the travel agency...

772
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,631
...got them on
another flight to Paris.

773
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,997
-l could've got them out!
-You tried, Aaron.

774
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,038
-lt was too expensive.
-This watch.

775
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,436
This watch could've paid
for their whole trip.

776
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,407
This ring.

777
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,173
This ring is one more dinner
l could've taken them out to.

778
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,107
Water.

779
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,583
-They need some water.
-Why?

780
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,619
They'll get dehydrated on the plane!

781
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,087
Get the Seinfelds some water!

782
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,823
Please!

783
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,652
Please!

784
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,299
Hi, Mr. Goldstein. ls Rachel home?

785
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,872
l'm afraid Rachel is not going
to see you tonight...

786
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,736
...or any other night for that matter.

787
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,809
-Why? What did l do?
-You know very well.

788
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,606
l heard about your behavior
at the movies the other night.

789
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,306
lt was disgraceful.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

790
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,814
l will not allow
my daughter to be involved...

791
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,511
...with someone of such weak
moral fiber.

792
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,816
Fortunately, my postman happened
to witness the entire incident.

793
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,460
A heavyset fellow. l believe
he lives in your building.

794
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,823
-Now, if you don't mind<i>....</i>
-Rachel.

795
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,588
-Rachel.
-Good night.

796
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,495
So my parents get home,
they open the door...

797
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,832
...my father flicks the light on, and
the whole place is cleaned out.

798
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,065
-Everything.
-Get out.

799
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,300
-How did that happen?
-The broken window.

800
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,241
Klompus never fixed it.
They just walked right in.

801
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,506
Boy, they could use a vacation.

802
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,277
They're taking one. The travel agent's
trying to set something up for them.

803
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,750
So how about that Aaron?

804
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,685
You know what drove me crazy
about him?

805
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,020
Did you ever notice he stood
too close to you when he talked?

806
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,293
No, l hadn't noticed.

807
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,060
Pair of bear claws, please.

808
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,602
-Hi, Newman.
-Hello, Jerry.

809
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,208
l happened to catch you coming out
of <i>Schindler's List</i> the other night.

810
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,367
Oh, were you there?

811
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,510
Yes, l was.

812
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,147
-lt's a powerful film.
-Yeah.

813
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,944
-Shocking brutality, don't you think?
-Shocking.

814
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,781
-Yeah, well, that was nothing.
-Jerry! Jerry!

815
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,220
Where the hell is your father?

816
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,868
This is the best thing we ever did.

817
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,300
l hope those exterminators
know what they're doing.

818
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,873
Forget about them.
Let's just try and relax.

819
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,535
Personal distance is
a very important thing.

820
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,906
There's a new personal distance,
ATM distance.

821
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,607
When someone's using an ATM,
you wanna be about 6 feet back.

822
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,719
Don't you? Because people get
edgy around that ATM, don't they?

823
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,084
They got their money out,
their eyes are darting all around.

824
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,418
The other place l wanna be
6 feet away is a urinal.

825
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,686
You want some distance there too.

826
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,729
ATMs and urinals. l guess whenever
someone's taking valuables...

827
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:45,232
...out of their pants, you wanna give
them as much room as possible.
