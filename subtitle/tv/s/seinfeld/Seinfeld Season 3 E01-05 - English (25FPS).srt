1
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:05,247
Every time somebody recommends
a doctor, he's always the best.

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,647
"This guy's the best."
They can't all be the best.

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,606
There can't be this many bests.

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,682
Someone's graduating
at the bottom of these classes.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,760
Where are these doctors?

6
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,085
Is somewhere someone
saying to their friend:

7
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:21,717
"You should see my doctor.
He's the worst.

8
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:24,768
Oh, yeah. He's the worst.
He's the absolute worst there is.

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,205
Whatever you've got,
it'll be worse after you see him.

10
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,202
He's just a... He's a butcher.
The man's a butcher."

11
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:36,162
Then there's always that, " Make sure
you tell him that you know me."

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,320
Why? What's the difference?
He's a doctor.

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,844
What is he...?
"Oh, you know Bob.

14
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,206
Oh, okay, I'll give you
the real medicine.

15
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,239
Everybody else
I'm giving Tic Tacs."

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,642
And usually for lunch, I'll have a salad.
And for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

17
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,202
What do you think
the worst part of being blind is?

18
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:04,963
Excuse me?

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,608
You know, if you were blind...

20
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,363
...what do you think
the worst part of it would be?

21
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,688
I don't know.

22
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,765
I think it would be not being able to tell
if there was bugs in my food.

23
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,158
How could you ever
enjoy a meal like that?

24
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,799
I'd constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.

25
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:30,763
Well, that's how my 5-year-old eats.
He's a very picky eater.

26
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:34,444
Hear about that kid that was kidnapped
the other day in Pennsylvania?

27
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,122
No.

28
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,008
He was at a carnival with his mother.
She gets a hot dog...

29
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:42,081
...next thing you know,
she turns around, boom, he's gone.

30
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,482
Imagine how sick a person has to be
to do something like that.

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,004
And these people
are all over the place.

32
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,366
You never know who's crazy.
I could be one of these people.

33
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:56,679
Have you seen any good movies?

34
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,601
Who takes care of your boy
during the day?

35
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,078
We have a woman. Why?

36
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,004
- No, I'm just saying.
- She had references.

37
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,763
I'm sure she did.
I'm sure they're impeccable.

38
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,965
I'm talking about the ones
that forge them.

39
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,725
You know,
I think this is really helping.

40
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,527
I don't live near here, you know.

41
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,041
So she's giving me the massage
and I'm just making conversation.

42
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,724
- I don't like to talk during a massage.
- Neither do I, but I do it for them.

43
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,959
- I figure they're bored.
- Yeah, I do that too.

44
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:35,008
I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.
I feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk.

45
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,887
It stops me from enjoying it.

46
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,528
There's nothing to eat in here.

47
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,478
- I forgot to tell you.
- I'm in the middle of a story.

48
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:44,004
- Okay, go ahead.
- Why don't you ever go shopping?

49
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,285
It's not like it's a really funny story.

50
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,964
- What happened?
- So she mentioned that she had a son.

51
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,687
And then for some reason...

52
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,524
...I launch into the story about the kid
from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

53
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,964
- Oh, wasn't that terrible?
- Yes, it was.

54
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,323
Not even an apple.

55
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,480
She doesn't wanna hear that.
That was stupid.

56
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,004
- I know it was stupid.
- Really stupid.

57
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,648
Hey, I just said it was stupid.

58
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:07,879
- What about this Chinese food?
- Take it.

59
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,246
- I can't believe you said that.
- Hey, would you stop it already.

60
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,082
So, what did she say?

61
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:15,160
She actually seemed
to get a little paranoid.

62
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,681
This is terrible.
What is this, ginger?

63
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,568
I hate ginger. I can't understand
how anyone can eat ginger.

64
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,765
- I have a good masseuse.
- No, she's really good.

65
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:26,238
She's not just a masseuse.
She's a physical therapist.

66
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,764
There's a big difference.
She uses the ultrasound.

67
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,282
It's a real medical procedure.

68
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:33,919
In fact, if you get a doctor's note,
it's covered by insurance.

69
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,166
Physical therapy is covered
by insurance?

70
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,557
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:43,199
- You don't pay for the massage?
- Not if you have a doctor's note.

72
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:45,007
So where do you get this note?

73
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,399
I've never actually done it,
but if I wanted to...

74
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,958
...I could probably get one from Roy,
the dentist.

75
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,642
Right. Your friend Roy.

76
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,640
What's the name
of this physical therapist?

77
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:57,245
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything
about her kid. She's a little off.

78
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,479
And you don't have to pay?

79
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:03,080
We have 3:00 appointments.

80
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,319
- George and Elaine, right?
- Right.

81
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,719
Could you fill these out, please?

82
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:10,608
And, Elaine,
you'll be seeing Julianna.

83
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,727
And, George,
you'll be with Raymond.

84
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,360
Excuse me. Did you say Raymond?

85
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,797
Yes.

86
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:27,645
But Raymond is a man.

87
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,282
That's right.

88
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,082
I can't get a massage from a man.

89
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,568
- Why not?
- What, are you crazy?

90
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,004
I can't have a man touching me.

91
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,768
Switch with me.

92
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,362
I don't want the man either.

93
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,642
What? You're a woman.
They're supposed to be touching you.

94
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:56,119
- He'd just be touching your back.
- He'd just be touching your back too.

95
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:59,042
- No, it could get sexual.
- I know.

96
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,440
That's the point. If it's gonna get
sexual, it should get sexual with you.

97
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,328
- I wouldn't be comfortable.
- I would?

98
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:08,526
- What if something happens?
- Oh, what could happen?

99
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,200
What if it felt good?

100
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,646
- It's supposed to feel good.
- I don't want it to feel good.

101
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,519
- Then why get the massage?
- Exactly.

102
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:27,888
George.

103
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,283
- Yes.
- I'm Raymond.

104
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,482
Hello.

105
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,767
Are you ready?

106
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,926
And then Julianna asked me if
I wanted to join her here in the office.

107
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,238
Really?

108
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,559
Used to be a flight attendant.

109
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,207
Oh, boy.

110
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:06,203
Why don't you open those pants.
It's gonna be a lot easier that way.

111
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,721
- So, what do you do?
- What?

112
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,000
I said, what do you do?

113
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,722
I don't know.

114
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,798
- You don't know what you do?
- No.

115
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,721
Oh, come on.

116
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,839
- You're very tense.
- Coffee. Too much coffee.

117
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,609
Take off those pants.
I'll work the hamstring.

118
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,158
Oh, the hamstring's fine.

119
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,162
- But you wrote that it was tender.
- I wrote. I wrote.

120
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,362
I'll check it out.

121
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,404
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Take them off.

122
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:22,888
How did you hurt this?

123
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,528
I don't know.

124
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:26,926
- You don't know?
- No.

125
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:28,761
- But you just told me.
- Korea.

126
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,559
- You hurt it in Korea?
- What?

127
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,118
- The hamstring.
- Korea.

128
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,168
How?

129
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,887
Hamstring.

130
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:40,279
How did you hurt the hamstring?

131
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,087
Hotel.

132
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,885
How'd it go?

133
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:54,167
George?

134
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:59,165
No appointments at all?
Because my neck is still tight.

135
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,001
What about Thursday?

136
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,761
And Friday?

137
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,759
Oh, boy. Okay. Thanks anyway.

138
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,761
What's with you?

139
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,847
A...

140
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,081
Yes. A...

141
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,361
A man gave me...

142
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,122
Yes. A man gave you...

143
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,247
A man gave me...

144
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,481
...a massage.

145
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,163
- So?
- So he...

146
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,082
...had his hands and...

147
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,724
He was...

148
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,398
- He was what?
- He... He was...

149
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,766
...touching and rubbing.

150
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,202
That's a massage.

151
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,079
- Then I took my pants off.
- You took your pants off?

152
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,040
For my hamstring.

153
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,521
He got about...

154
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,725
...two inches from...

155
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,961
...there.
- Really?

156
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,120
I think it moved.

157
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,000
- It moved?
- It may have moved. I don't know.

158
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,763
- I'm sure it didn't move.
- It moved!

159
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,762
It was imperceptible, but I felt it.

160
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,682
Maybe it just wanted
to change positions. You know...

161
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,044
...shift to the other side.
- No, no.

162
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,679
It wasn't a shift. I've shifted.
This was a move.

163
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,358
- Okay. So what if it moved?
- That's the sign, the test.

164
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,043
If a... If a man makes it move.

165
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,769
That's not the test.
Contact is the test.

166
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,365
If it moves as a result of contact.

167
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,240
Do you think it's contact?
It has to be touched?

168
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,684
That's what a gym teacher
once told me.

169
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,481
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,685
I just saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts.

171
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,079
You know, I looked in there and there
he was having coffee and a doughnut.

172
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:57,602
Joe DiMaggio?

173
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,327
- In Dinky Doughnuts?
- Yes.

174
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:01,639
- Joe DiMaggio.
- No. I'm sorry.

175
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,404
If Joe DiMaggio wants a doughnut,
he goes to a fancy restaurant.

176
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:07,560
He's not sitting in Dinky Doughnuts.

177
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,765
Well, maybe he likes
Dinky Doughnuts.

178
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,885
I don't like to sit next
to men on airplanes...

179
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,607
...because our knees might touch.

180
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,203
I can't see Joe DiMaggio
sitting at the counter...

181
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,281
...at little, tiny, filthy,
smelly Dinky Doughnuts.

182
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,838
Why can't he have a doughnut
like everybody else?

183
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,524
He can have a doughnut,
but not a Dinky.

184
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,646
I don't even like to use urinals.
Always been a stall man.

185
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,881
Look, I'm telling...

186
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,998
I'm telling you,
that was Joe DiMaggio.

187
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,966
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe.
He's in Dinky Doughnuts.

188
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,403
What about this doctor's note?

189
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,639
- Let's go see Roy.
- I never said I'd do that.

190
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,879
What are you talking about?
That's 75 bucks.

191
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm not working. I can't afford that.

192
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,722
I don't know how I feel about it.

193
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:54,278
Oh, what are you,
like a Quaker now?

194
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,001
All right, all right.

195
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,160
A stall man, huh?

196
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,921
So we were wondering if it was
possible for you to write us a note.

197
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,761
And if you can't,
believe me, it's fine.

198
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,568
- He didn't say he can't.
- lf you feel funny about it at all.

199
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,242
- He doesn't feel funny.
- lf he does.

200
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,842
- Do you feel funny?
- Forget it.

201
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:16,445
- He didn't say anything.
- He feels funny.

202
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,562
- You don't have to do this.
- He knows that!

203
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,845
Should we go?
Is this a breach of our friendship?

204
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

205
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,239
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,168
Holyfield. He's a good friend
of one of my patients.

207
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,081
He's got a hell of a body,
doesn't he?

208
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:34,762
How would I know?

209
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,442
Do you like him?

210
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:39,242
What do you mean, like him?

211
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,838
- Do you like him?
- Well, I mean, he's a good fighter...

212
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,364
...and a nice guy,
but I don't like him.

213
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,204
- How come you don't like him?
- Why should I?

214
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,485
- What is the matter with you?
- Nothing. Why?

215
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,958
You think something's wrong?
Am I different?

216
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,604
- So you want the notes?
- You don't have to, really.

217
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,361
No, no. It's okay.

218
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,680
We should probably get one
for Elaine too, right, George?

219
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:02,118
George?

220
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,602
George.

221
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,522
What about the week after?

222
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,724
No appointments at all?

223
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,407
What?

224
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,048
Well, can l...?

225
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:24,918
Can I at least just talk to her
so I can apologize?

226
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:27,447
Forget it.

227
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:31,443
I can't believe this.
I make one innocent comment...

228
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,601
...about some lunatic in Pennsylvania,
and I'm cut off.

229
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:37,158
This woman is insane.

230
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,600
What's with you?

231
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:41,602
What?

232
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,847
You were too close to me.
I was all scrunched in there.

233
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,205
Hey, you scrunched me.

234
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,803
I sat down here first.

235
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,202
Hey.

236
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,167
I saw DiMaggio
in the doughnut shop again.

237
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,561
- Yeah.
- Joe DiMaggio?

238
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,721
Joe DiMaggio. This time I went in
and I sat down across from him...

239
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,288
...and I really watched him.

240
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,599
I studied his every move.

241
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,966
For example, he dunks.

242
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,364
- Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts?
- That's right.

243
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,805
See, now I know it's not him.
Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

244
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,766
Oh, he's a dunker.

245
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,522
- Why couldn't he be a dunker?
- Nothing diverts his attention.

246
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,442
Like, I'm sitting in there,
you know...

247
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:34,125
...and I start banging on the table
so that he'll look up.

248
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,881
Like I'm sitting there, and l...

249
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:43,408
He wouldn't move. So then I started
doing these yelping noises, like:

250
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,248
No reaction, because the guy
is so focused, you see.

251
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,287
He can just block out anything
that's going on around him.

252
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,838
See, that's how he played baseball.

253
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,364
He dunks like he hits.

254
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,121
- So then what?
- Well...

255
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,042
...then the waitress, she comes up
and she tells me to shut up...

256
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,006
...or they're gonna throw me out.

257
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:09,808
Why didn't you just
call out his name?

258
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,207
What happened to you?

259
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,966
These kids called me a Mary.

260
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,723
A what?

261
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,244
I was jumping over a puddle.

262
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,606
For some reason, I went like this:

263
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,727
And they called me a Mary.

264
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,881
So I chased them
and I tripped and I fell.

265
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:39,405
Yeah, you know kids.
They can be very perceptive.

266
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,643
Hey, George. What is this?

267
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,037
What is that?

268
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,325
No, really. What is that?

269
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,442
Hello.

270
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,440
Oh, hi, Roy.

271
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:55,883
What?

272
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,483
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,205
How did this happen?

274
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,406
What can I do?

275
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,003
I am so sorry.

276
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:07,563
Okay.

277
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:08,957
Bye.

278
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,439
That was Roy. He's under
investigation for insurance fraud.

279
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,201
- I told you.
- Told me what?

280
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,883
- I told you we shouldn't do it.
- I didn't say anything.

281
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:34,598
He's got a house, a family.
They could take away his license.

282
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,648
Three notes. How stupid was that?
We never should've got three notes.

283
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,004
- Three notes?
- Yeah. You, me and George.

284
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,568
- You got me a note?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,287
- But I got my own note.
- You what?

286
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,759
- I got a note from my gynecologist.
- Why'd you do that?

287
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:50,762
- I didn't know you'd get me a note.
- Of course I'd get you a note.

288
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,885
- You didn't say anything.
- Neither did you.

289
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:55,961
That's how he got caught. We
sent in four notes from two doctors.

290
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,438
How could you do that
to your friend?

291
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:04,683
He's got a wife, kids
and a lot of other stuff.

292
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:08,046
Oh, yeah.

293
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:14,440
- Hi, Pam.
- Hello.

294
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,167
Hello.

295
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,402
I just thought maybe
I could talk to Roy if...

296
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:22,527
Pam, did the x-ray
from Mrs. Sloane...?

297
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,883
- Hi.
- Hi, Roy.

298
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,960
- How you doing?
- Come on back.

299
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:28,040
I have a patient, but she's under.

300
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,044
- I don't even know what to say.
- Me neither.

301
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,962
- I knew this would happen.
- Me too.

302
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,245
I mean, the whole thing, it's just...

303
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,798
- Tragic.
- Well, it's not tragic.

304
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,925
- No?
- No. It's...

305
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,478
- Unsettling?
- Okay.

306
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:49,528
- I mean, what if they...?
- I hope you're both happy.

307
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:53,638
I'm not happy.

308
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,480
Me, neither.
I've never been happy.

309
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:02,761
I mean, I'm happy sometimes,
but not now.

310
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,999
In college, maybe.

311
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,685
- Those were fun times.
- Yeah, college was fun.

312
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:12,765
You know the whole practice
is in jeopardy. You know that.

313
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,927
- Don't mind her.
- Oh, please. I love her.

314
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,683
I've just met her,
but I'm very impressed.

315
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,602
I've never had a problem
with these notes before.

316
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,282
What's gonna happen now?

317
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,839
Nothing, as long as we get the physical
therapist to go along with our story.

318
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,522
What? The physical therapist? Why?

319
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:33,362
She has to say the complaint
was related to a dental problem.

320
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,923
How you doing?

321
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,525
Hi. Look, I know
I don't have an appointment...

322
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,203
...but it's really important
that I talk with Julianna.

323
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,848
I'm sorry. She's not in.

324
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,569
I know she's mad at me,
but I really have to speak with her.

325
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,162
I told you she's not here.

326
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,887
Look, you have to leave.

327
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,482
Wait a second. Don't you...?

328
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:58,765
Hi. Look,
I don't know what you think...

329
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,362
- Please.
- But, you see...

330
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,202
Let me talk to you for a second.
What I did is inadvertently...

331
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,963
I treated you, so please
just get out of the office.

332
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:07,723
Can't you listen to me?

333
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,608
Run, Billy! Run to the office
and close the door.

334
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,038
Call the police.

335
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,481
The police.

336
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:15,968
What is the...?

337
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,642
Hi, George.

338
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,248
Hello.

339
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,762
Raymond?

340
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,162
Well, I mean,
it's only a six-month probation.

341
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:30,762
It's a slap on the wrist.

342
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:33,887
I still don't see any dinner invitations
forthcoming.

343
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,998
Men have been popping
into my sexual fantasies.

344
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:41,365
All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.

345
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:43,683
Of what?

346
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,402
And a guy will appear
from out of nowhere.

347
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:50,797
I said, "Get out of here.

348
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,005
What do you want?
You don't belong here."

349
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,888
- What do they do?
- They talk back.

350
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,119
They go, " Hey, George,
how's it going?"

351
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,678
I said, "Get the hell out of here."

352
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,840
Hey, it's the K-Man.

353
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,840
Maybe it's time
you got a different hobby.

354
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,558
Oh, man.

355
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,959
Just came from Roy's.

356
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,288
I threw up from the gas.

357
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:25,566
- Did he say anything?
- No, no. He's fine.

358
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,160
Oh, my God. It's...

359
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,684
- What?
- Joe DiMaggio.

360
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,364
Having a cup of coffee.

361
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,999
- And he's dunking.
- Yeah.

362
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:40,321
Look at him.

363
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:42,923
The Yankee Clipper.

364
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,363
Here.

365
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:47,527
You see?
Now, that is a handsome man.

366
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,437
Oh, please.

367
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,725
Wait. Hold on a minute. Wait.

368
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,687
See? I told you.

369
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,202
What causes homophobia?

370
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:12,760
What is it that makes
a heterosexual man worry?

371
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:17,167
I think it's because men know
that deep down...

372
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,399
...we have weak sales resistance.

373
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,006
We're constantly buying shoes
that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.

374
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:27,044
Men think, "Obviously,
I can be talked into anything.

375
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:30,366
What if I accidentally wander
into some sort of homosexual store...

376
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,759
...thinking it's a shoe store,
and the salesman goes:

377
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,888
'Just hold this guy's hand, walk
around the store. See how you feel.

378
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,719
No obligation, no pressure,
just try it.

379
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,399
Would you like to see him
in a sandal?"'

380
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,400

381
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:40,971
Good evening. Welcome to the show.
The extra buttons.

382
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:44,324
Yeah.

383
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:48,964
What kind of a sicko, really,
would save these...

384
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:51,566
...have them in a huge file?

385
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:54,724
Drawers that wide.
You know, you just...

386
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,681
"Where the hell is that but..."

387
00:21:57,852 --> 00:22:01,925
I mean, is it that hard to get
black, round buttons...

388
00:22:02,092 --> 00:22:03,889
...that they make it
into a whole thing?

389
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:05,610
Like this is such a great jacket.

390
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:09,765
These buttons are so unique,
so one-of-a-kind.

391
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:12,241
You'll never find them.
We'll save you the trouble...

392
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:15,449
...of knocking your brains out.
We know they're going to fall off too.

393
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:18,172
That's the other point that
they're trying to make here.

394
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,770
Everyone in my family's creative.

395
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:29,049
And even though I'm working
as an accountant right now...

396
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,443
...l'd really like to eventually
work exclusively...

397
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:34,807
...on my papier-mâché hats.

398
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:40,722
I don't understand.
Papier-mâché hats?

399
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:45,165
What if it rains?

400
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,327
They're art.
You hang them on the wall.

401
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:50,966
Art.

402
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,485
It's my creative outlet,
one of my passions.

403
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:55,926
Any money in it?

404
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:59,167
"Who so belongs only to his age...

405
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:02,961
...reverences only its popinjays
and mumbo jumbos."

406
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:06,168
Of course. Right.

407
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:09,848
- Thomas Carlyle, 1864.
- Tommy C.

408
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,044
These are the receipts from '85.

409
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,442
- And I'm gonna do '86.
- I'm sorry.

410
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:23,082
I thought it was a legitimate charity.
I didn't know you'd get audited.

411
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,447
I don't blame you. I blame myself.

412
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,842
- No, blame me.
- Okay, I blame you.

413
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,401
- No, no, don't blame me.
- What was I supposed to do?

414
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,130
I was on my first date with Elaine.

415
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,806
You come barging in here,
asking me to contribute money...

416
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:37,532
...to a volcano relief fund
for Krakatoa.

417
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:39,205
It was supposed to erupt.

418
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:41,010
I find the whole thing embarrassing.

419
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,163
Well, you know what
my feelings are about this.

420
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:44,526
I don't even pay taxes.

421
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:46,922
Yeah. That's easy when
you have no income.

422
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:50,963
- Hi.
- Hi.

423
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:54,408
Kramer, do me a favour, will you?

424
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:57,370
If you insist on making pasta
in my apartment...

425
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:01,640
...please don't put the tomato sauce
on the pasta while it's in the strainer.

426
00:24:01,812 --> 00:24:06,249
All the little squares have
hardened red sauce in them.

427
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:09,049
What's so funny?

428
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:12,409
Oh, I don't know. Kramer dating
your roommate, it's funny.

429
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,404
It's a riot, Alice.

430
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:17,205
When do you put the sauce on?

431
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,930
Any other time.

432
00:24:19,412 --> 00:24:22,722
No, no, no. I like to strain the sauce.

433
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:26,482
And I could really live without...

434
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:31,123
...the tribal music and the make-out
sessions in the living room.

435
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,691
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.

436
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:42,282
- What are you doing? What is all this?
- Oh, he's helping me sort my receipts.

437
00:24:42,452 --> 00:24:43,851
I'm being audited.

438
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:46,162
You're being audited? What for?

439
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:49,563
Oh, I contributed money to a charity
that turned out to be fraudulent.

440
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:52,724
- It's really very boring.
- When was this?

441
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,122
A long, long time ago...

442
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:58,329
...in a galaxy far, far away.

443
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:03,560
I remember you donated to some
volcano thing on our first date.

444
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:06,002
Volcano? Really?

445
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:09,012
Oh, wait a minute.
Don't tell me that that was...

446
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:10,924
Something to drink?

447
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,889
What, did you think
that would impress me?

448
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:14,326
You've got me all wrong.

449
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:17,650
I was thinking only
of the poor Krakatoan.

450
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:19,768
Like you'd make this donation
for 50 bucks...

451
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:21,763
...and I'd start tearing my clothes off?

452
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:24,526
Those brave Krakatoans...

453
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,328
...east of Java...

454
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,564
...who sacrificed so much,
for so long.

455
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:32,370
Now you're being audited
because of it.

456
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,762
- See, that's karma.
- No, that's Kramer.

457
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:42,049
- So, what are you gonna do?
- It's all taken care of.

458
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:43,440
How is that?

459
00:25:44,532 --> 00:25:46,966
An old friend of mine,
whom you may have met...

460
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:49,692
...George Costanza,
has recently become intimate...

461
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:52,207
...with a female accountant
who was formerly...

462
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:54,806
...a highly placed official
with a little outfit...

463
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,930
...known as the IRS.

464
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:01,004
And as we speak,
at this very moment...

465
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:05,445
...he is handing over to her
all of my pertinent tax information...

466
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,768
...and she has assured us...

467
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:12,165
...that the matter is well within
her field of expertise.

468
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:14,806
Why is she doing this?

469
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:16,883
I don't know. It must be love.

470
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,523
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

471
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:22,644
You're great...

472
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,770
...but I'm riddled
with personal problems.

473
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:28,162
- What's wrong? What did I do?
- Nothing. It's not you.

474
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:32,120
It's me. I have a fear of commitment.

475
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:35,090
- I don't know how to love.
- You hate my earrings, don't you?

476
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:37,285
- No, no.
- And you didn't comment...

477
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:38,646
...on the chopsticks.

478
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:42,885
I love the chopsticks. I personally
prefer a fork, but they look very nice.

479
00:26:44,652 --> 00:26:47,371
You're not telling me the truth.
I must have done something.

480
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:50,886
- I have a fear of intimacy. l...
- Don't give me clichés.

481
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:52,690
I have a right to know.
What did I do?

482
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:54,126
Nothing. It's not you.

483
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:55,645
I want the truth!

484
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:58,804
The truth? You want the truth?!

485
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:00,564
It is your earrings!

486
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,051
It is your chopsticks.

487
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:04,726
But it's so much more.
You're pretentious.

488
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:07,049
You call everyone by their full name.

489
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:09,601
You called my doorman Sammy,
"Samuel."

490
00:27:09,772 --> 00:27:13,367
But you didn't even say Samuel.
You went "Samuel."

491
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,124
Papier-mâché?

492
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:17,647
What is papier-mâché?

493
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,166
Keep going.

494
00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:23,565
I think I made my point.

495
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:26,610
I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.

496
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,648
No. I asked for the truth.

497
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,084
Thank you for being so honest.

498
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:34,645
Can I...?

499
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:38,521
- Can I walk you back to work?
- I really prefer to go alone.

500
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:41,360
How much do I owe?

501
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:42,931
Oh, please.

502
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:46,002
Four dollars is fine.

503
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:50,247
If this audit had happened to me and
I didn't have this woman to help me...

504
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:53,961
...I would've killed this man. I would've
strangled him with my bare hands.

505
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,088
- I don't blame you.
- Ever been through an audit?

506
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:57,844
- No.
- It's hell.

507
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:01,368
It's the financial equivalent
of a complete rectal examination.

508
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:03,204
I would've killed this man.

509
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:04,771
Torn him limb from limb.

510
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:07,969
Ripped the flesh right off his bones.

511
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:11,766
- Yeah?
- It's George.

512
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:13,206
Come on up.

513
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:16,526
There he is, the man himself...

514
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:18,489
...George Louis Costanza.

515
00:28:18,652 --> 00:28:20,882
Here I am, about to go
to the electric chair...

516
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:23,612
...and my oldest friend
is dating the governor.

517
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:28,725
My whole life has been
a complete waste of time.

518
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:30,485
And there's so much more to go.

519
00:28:30,652 --> 00:28:33,325
Now I know what I'm supposed
to do. It is so simple.

520
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:37,201
Tell the truth. That's all.
Just tell the truth.

521
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:39,567
- You give her my tax papers?
- What?

522
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:41,484
My papers?

523
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,240
What?

524
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:46,164
Oh, the papers.

525
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:48,842
- You didn't give her the papers?
- No, I did.

526
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,650
So?

527
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:54,569
I broke up with her.

528
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:05,522
- You what?
- I broke up with her.

529
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:07,125
I'm being audited...

530
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,852
...and you broke up with her?
- It's okay. It's fine.

531
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:13,721
- She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
- Why? Why will she still do it?

532
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:17,043
She hates you now. People don't
do you favours after you dump them.

533
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,725
No, no. We left on good terms.

534
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,723
How is that possible?

535
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,202
Because l...
I told her the truth.

536
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:26,608
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

537
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:28,888
- It's unheard of.
- She asked me to.

538
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:30,280
So you lie.

539
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:33,808
- What did you tell her?
- I told her that she was pretentious.

540
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,325
Pretentious?

541
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:38,962
The woman has my tax papers.
You told her she's pretentious?

542
00:29:39,132 --> 00:29:40,531
The IRS...

543
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:42,967
...they're like the Mafia.
They take anything they want.

544
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:45,441
How would you like it if
someone told you the truth?

545
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:48,206
- What? What could they say?
- There are plenty of things to say.

546
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:50,681
Like what? I'm bald?
What is it specifically?

547
00:29:50,852 --> 00:29:52,888
Is there an odour I'm not aware of?

548
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:55,123
- George, please.
- Give me one.

549
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:57,562
- You sure?
- Yes.

550
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:59,245
Okay.

551
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:03,367
You're extremely...

552
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,484
...careful with money.

553
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,645
I'm what?

554
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:10,882
- Forget it.
- I'm cheap? You think I'm cheap?!

555
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:13,441
How could you say that to me?
I can't believe this!

556
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,921
- How could you say that to me?
- You asked me to.

557
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:17,969
- You should've lied.
- So should you!

558
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:20,202
Okay, wait a second.
What happened to my papers?

559
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,886
- I'm not really working right now.
- I know.

560
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:25,850
When I was working, I spent, baby!

561
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:30,366
Yeah, I know.
Champagne, limos, cigars.

562
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:32,045
What happened to the papers?

563
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:34,567
She put them in her pocketbook.
I guess she took them.

564
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,725
- A pocketbook or a handbag?
- Is that relevant? She took them.

565
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,163
Call her office.

566
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:42,765
Give me the phone.

567
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:52,525
Yeah, hi, I'd like to speak to Patrice.

568
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:54,770
What?

569
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:57,489
Oh, really.

570
00:30:57,732 --> 00:31:00,200
Oh, okay. Thank you.

571
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,649
What? What?

572
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,324
She never came back from lunch.

573
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:09,083
This is no good.

574
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,483
This is no good.

575
00:31:13,612 --> 00:31:15,523
Call her house.

576
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:22,005
Hi. Are you okay?

577
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:25,000
No, no. No...

578
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:31,683
She hung up.

579
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,290
Not good.

580
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:38,166
All right, look,
there's nothing to be worried about.

581
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:40,368
She's just a little annoyed right now.

582
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,443
Tomorrow, I'll personally
go over there.

583
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:45,532
I'll apologize. I'll get the papers.

584
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:49,011
Don't worry. Don't worry.

585
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:52,409
Not good.

586
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:57,366
Yeah, it's a windshield.

587
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:01,331
I can see that. What's it for?

588
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:03,403
I found it on the road.

589
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:09,768
- Yeah?
- I just finished working out.

590
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:12,685
- Are you busy?
- No. Come on up.

591
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:16,049
Can you believe somebody
threw this out?

592
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:20,370
I'm gonna make a coffee table
out of this and surprise Tina.

593
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:22,682
Well, wouldn't it be invisible?

594
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,924
I mean, what, are you gonna just
sense it's in front of the couch?

595
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:28,130
Well...

596
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:38,131
Hello.

597
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:40,284
Hello.

598
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:44,403
What's with you two?

599
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:49,287
- You haven't told him?
- Told me what?

600
00:32:51,412 --> 00:32:53,846
Go ahead, tell him.

601
00:32:54,412 --> 00:32:56,209
I saw her naked.

602
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:04,408
He saw me naked.

603
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:08,250
Kramer saw me naked.

604
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:11,051
Well, it was an accident.

605
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:14,010
Who walks into a woman's bedroom
without knocking? I wanna know.

606
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,323
I thought it was a closet.

607
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:19,086
Completely naked?

608
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,852
Completely naked.

609
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:25,883
Jerry, how can I go on?

610
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:32,560
All right, if it's gonna make you feel
any better, you can see me naked.

611
00:33:32,732 --> 00:33:34,324
No, thank you.

612
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,243
- No, I want you to see me naked.
- No, no, no.

613
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:38,640
- I wanna show you.
- No! Jerry!

614
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:40,928
Hold it. Just a second.

615
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:44,243
Let's not lose our heads here.

616
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:47,087
Kramer, you know you're always
welcome in my home...

617
00:33:47,252 --> 00:33:49,561
...but as far as Mr. Johnson
is concerned...

618
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:52,007
...that's another story.

619
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:57,689
- What is this?
- It's a windshield.

620
00:33:58,012 --> 00:34:00,128
It's going to be
your new coffee table.

621
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:03,763
I'm gonna kill myself on that thing.
You can't even see it.

622
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:05,365
You'll sense it.

623
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:12,640
Well? What happened?
Was she there?

624
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:14,643
No. No, she wasn't.

625
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:17,042
- You didn't get my papers?
- No, I didn't.

626
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,331
Well, where is she?

627
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,766
A mental institution.

628
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:28,525
Why is it so difficult,
uncomfortable to be naked?

629
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,648
It's because we have clothes on...

630
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:34,282
...you can always make those little
adjustments, which people love to do.

631
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:37,603
You feel like you're getting it together.
"Yeah, I look pretty good.

632
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:39,888
Feeling good, looking good."

633
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:44,250
But when you're naked, it's like...
It's so final. You're just, "Well...

634
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:46,209
...that's it.

635
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,329
There's nothing else I can do."

636
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:52,404
That's why I like to wear
a belt when I'm naked.

637
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:54,164
Because I feel
it gives me something.

638
00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:57,051
Some, you know,
"I'm naked, but, you know..."

639
00:34:57,652 --> 00:35:00,530
I'd like to get pockets to hang
off of the belt. That would be...

640
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:02,523
Wouldn't that be the ultimate thing?

641
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:05,684
To be naked
and still be able to do this.

642
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:08,844
I think that would really help a lot.

643
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,330
A mental institution?

644
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:16,643
You know what they do in there?
Did you see Cuck oo's Nest?

645
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:19,122
They put those electrodes
in your head.

646
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:21,010
It's not really a mental institution.

647
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:22,810
It's more like a depression clinic.

648
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:26,328
She went out to Woodhaven and
checked herself in. I'm sick over this.

649
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,403
- Who told you this?
- Her roommate.

650
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,290
I've driven women
to lesbianism before...

651
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:32,329
...but never to a mental institution.

652
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:38,565
My friend Bob Sacamano
had shock treatments.

653
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:41,849
But his synapses were so large,
had no effect.

654
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:46,647
You know, I hate to raise
a crass financial concern...

655
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:51,442
...but was there any information
as to the whereabouts of my papers?

656
00:35:52,372 --> 00:35:55,887
She put them in her pocketbook. She
probably took them out there with her.

657
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:58,162
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

658
00:35:58,332 --> 00:35:59,526
Can we go out there?

659
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:01,922
- Where?
- Woodhaven.

660
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:05,445
We could.

661
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:07,844
I'm very nervous about this.

662
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:11,243
I've never spoken
to a mental patient before.

663
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:14,172
My cousin Douglas
was in a place like this one time.

664
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:17,927
Came over to my house for dinner,
there was no soda...

665
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,083
...and he went berserk.

666
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:22,891
He was screaming, "Where's
the Pepsi? Where's the Pepsi?"

667
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:25,520
I should be in a place like this.

668
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:27,884
I envy this woman.

669
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:30,800
Get to wear slippers all day.

670
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,208
Friends visit, they pity you.

671
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:38,005
Pity's very underrated. I like it.
It's good.

672
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:41,290
Plus, they give you those word-
association tests. I love those.

673
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,522
They're great.
There's no wrong answer.

674
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:46,331
- Potato.
- Tuberculosis.

675
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:49,283
- Blanket.
- Leroy.

676
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:52,365
- Grass.
- Tuberculosis.

677
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:57,843
Oh, boy. Here she comes.

678
00:37:05,012 --> 00:37:06,286
Oh, my God.

679
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:14,844
Oh, Kram...

680
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:26,966
Kramer! Kramer, could you please...

681
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:28,565
...put something on?

682
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:31,927
Well... Oh, boy.

683
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:34,322
Listen, you want some leftovers?

684
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:37,609
I made some African food.
There's yambalas and sambusa.

685
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:39,690
Sweetie.

686
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:44,005
- Are you coming back to bed?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there, babe.

687
00:37:46,492 --> 00:37:48,528
Hi, Elaine.

688
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:52,885
What did you think
of the coffee table?

689
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:55,764
It's invisible.

690
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:57,206
So is everything cool or what?

691
00:37:57,372 --> 00:37:59,886
Yeah, you seem
a little bit dysfunctional.

692
00:38:01,372 --> 00:38:03,840
- Well...
- Come on, Elaine...

693
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:05,604
...just tell us the truth.

694
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:08,724
The truth?

695
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:10,325
You want the truth?

696
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:13,005
Who are you?

697
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,686
This is my friend...

698
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,564
...Jerry.

699
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,930
Why are you talking like that?

700
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:26,242
And what do you want?

701
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:27,811
Want? What could I possibly want?

702
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:32,090
I just came because I heard so many
nice things about you from George.

703
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:34,004
George thinks I'm pretentious.

704
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:37,166
Pretentious. Who isn't pretentious?
I mean...

705
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:41,007
...if everyone that was pretentious
was in a mental institution...

706
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:44,084
Obviously,
this isn't a mental institution.

707
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:48,882
You're trying to take it back because
you're feeling guilty I'm in here.

708
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:51,122
- No, that's not it at all.
- Don't lie, George!

709
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,407
I'm not a liar.

710
00:38:53,012 --> 00:38:54,286
We're cool. Everything's cool.

711
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:56,841
- No problem. We're good.
- Just chatting.

712
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:58,331
Very friendly.

713
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:02,444
Alrighty.

714
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,202
No reason for us to raise our voices.

715
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:07,647
I know what you said.
You can't change that.

716
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,848
What I said.
I say stupid things all the time.

717
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:12,162
I can't go two minutes
without saying something dumb.

718
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:16,086
It's one stupid thing after another.

719
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:18,812
So let me ask you, when you come
to one of these places...

720
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,610
...do you bring your pocketbook?

721
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,084
You should be the one criticizing me.

722
00:39:23,252 --> 00:39:25,766
I'm lucky to even know
someone like you.

723
00:39:26,252 --> 00:39:27,844
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

724
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:30,480
- I'm incapable of guile.
- He's never guiled.

725
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,331
You know, some women keep a lot of
important papers in their pocketbooks.

726
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:37,369
Like, for example...

727
00:39:37,532 --> 00:39:40,490
...someone else's
personal financial papers.

728
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:42,926
Papers.

729
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:45,970
Oh, Jerry. You're the Jerome
with the tax problem.

730
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:48,809
You know,
after that date with George...

731
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,611
...I got so cuckoo,
I threw out all your papers.

732
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:54,161
So I'd love to help you,
but I'll just need the copies.

733
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,530
There are no copies.

734
00:39:58,492 --> 00:39:59,811
So...

735
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:02,406
...are you saying you want
to continue seeing me?

736
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:04,883
Who makes copies?

737
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:08,486
The truth is...

738
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,726
...I think...

739
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:15,768
...you make a very nice couple.

740
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:19,923
Oh, Kramer.

741
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:33,521
- Here, Kramer?
- No, no.

742
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:35,762
Let's go to the couch.

743
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:41,360
Yes, I'm trying to get
a copy of a receipt...

744
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:44,569
...for a computer that I bought there.

745
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:48,526
It was 1987.

746
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:53,011
I remember I talked to a guy,
had, like, a maroon sport jacket...

747
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:56,847
...and he might have had a toupee.
Oh, it was a weave?

748
00:40:57,852 --> 00:41:00,889
Okay, well, then I'll come by.

749
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:02,280
Okay, bye.

750
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:05,160
Anybody want to take a walk down
to 48th Street?

751
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:07,687
I think I may have tracked
down another receipt.

752
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:10,891
I can't. I got to go visit Tina
in the hospital.

753
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,043
- George?
- I'm going to a poetry reading...

754
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:14,440
...with Patrice.

755
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:16,523
First-time poets.

756
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:19,604
It's in a burnt-out building
down by the docks.

757
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:21,924
It's supposed to be good.

758
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:27,125
Are you going to the hospital now?

759
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:29,806
- Yeah, I suppose I am.
- All right. Great, great.

760
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:31,121
We'll share a cab.

761
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,010
You going by 48th.
You can give me a ride.

762
00:41:33,172 --> 00:41:34,446
I'm getting in on that.

763
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:36,409
- Yeah.
- You know you're chipping in.

764
00:41:36,572 --> 00:41:38,563
You're going that way anyway!

765
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:40,529
Come on.

766
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:44,163
I was audited last year.
I have been through an audit.

767
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:47,244
At first, I thought, "Well,
IRS kind of sounds like Toys 'R' Us.

768
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:50,484
Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe they
have a sense of fun about it."

769
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:53,246
You know?
But it's bad. It's an ordeal.

770
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:56,131
And they don't do anything
to keep your spirits up...

771
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:57,850
...through the ordeal.

772
00:41:58,052 --> 00:42:00,691
I think they should take all
your receipts and put them...

773
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,968
...in one of those big,
Lucite sweepstake drums...

774
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:04,884
...and just kind of crank
it around there.

775
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:08,283
Give you a feeling like you might win
something. You know what I mean?

776
00:42:08,452 --> 00:42:10,170
Then they can pull them out and go:

777
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:13,927
"Oh, I'm sorry.
That's another illegal deduction...

778
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:18,882
...but we do have some lovely
parting gifts for you. Jail."

779

780
00:43:10,775 --> 00:43:12,208
So I'm on the plane. We left late.

781
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:17,289
Pilot says, "We're going to be making
up some time." Isn't that interesting?

782
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:18,649
They just make up time.

783
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:20,612
That's why you have to
reset your watch.

784
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,051
Of course when they say
they're making up time...

785
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:26,730
...obviously, they're increasing
the speed of the aircraft.

786
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,807
Now my question is,
if you can go faster...

787
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:32,853
...why don't you just go
as fast as you can...

788
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:34,573
...all the time?

789
00:43:34,735 --> 00:43:38,444
Come on. There's no cops up here.
Nail it. Give it some gas.

790
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,685
We're flying.

791
00:43:44,935 --> 00:43:47,529
Travelling, of course,
is the best education.

792
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:48,889
You know, last year...

793
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:54,887
...I was ill for 40, 45 countries...

794
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:58,934
...and I would've gone to more,
but I'd just got a puppy.

795
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,290
And he was too young
to take with me.

796
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:03,889
But not now.
I won't travel without him.

797
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:06,444
- Is he on the plane now?
- Oh, yes.

798
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:10,009
Yes, he's in
the baggage compartment.

799
00:44:10,175 --> 00:44:13,565
I don't know why they won't
let him sit up here with me.

800
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,374
He's a lot better behaved
than most of the dregs...

801
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:18,844
...you find onboard here.

802
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,253
You have any pets?

803
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:24,848
Just my next-door neighbour.

804
00:44:25,015 --> 00:44:26,243
Well...

805
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:28,724
...you are missing out
on a relationship...

806
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:33,286
...that could enrich your life in ways
that you never even thought possible.

807
00:44:33,455 --> 00:44:36,606
How about picking up their...?
You know.

808
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,686
You find that enriching?

809
00:44:41,535 --> 00:44:43,890
- What's the matter?
- Oh, I'm feeling a bit...

810
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,534
...queasy.

811
00:44:47,015 --> 00:44:49,654
Sir, we're gonna make
an emergency landing in Chicago...

812
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,646
...and get you to a hospital.

813
00:44:52,175 --> 00:44:54,131
My dog.

814
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:55,694
What about my dog?

815
00:44:55,855 --> 00:44:57,174
You have a dog?

816
00:44:57,335 --> 00:44:59,212
Do you know anyone
on the plane, Mr. Palone?

817
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,446
Jerry.

818
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:08,414
How you feeling?

819
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,214
Would you take care of Farfel?

820
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:13,443
Farfel?

821
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:16,413
It's his dog. We're landing in
Chicago to get him to a hospital.

822
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:20,204
- Could you take his dog to New York?
- The dog?

823
00:45:20,615 --> 00:45:23,083
- The dog?
- I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

824
00:45:23,415 --> 00:45:25,167
But, you know...
What if, you know...?

825
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:27,724
Give me your address
and phone number. I'll call you.

826
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:29,694
The dog?

827
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:35,414
Let go, Farfel.

828
00:45:35,575 --> 00:45:37,213
Let go. Give me that.

829
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:40,447
Give me that sneaker,
you stupid idiot.

830
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,568
Shut up!

831
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,803
So, what would you do?

832
00:45:45,975 --> 00:45:48,694
It's only been three days.
I'm sure he's gonna call.

833
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,929
Stop it! Shut up!

834
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:56,055
Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I'm dealing with?

835
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:58,046
I got a wild animal in the house.

836
00:45:58,215 --> 00:46:01,685
He'd deranged. Maybe he's got
rabies. I can get lockjaw.

837
00:46:02,535 --> 00:46:05,174
- lf only.
- Look at this place.

838
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,768
He's going everywhere.

839
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:11,132
I can't go out of the house at night.
I haven't performed in three days.

840
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:13,604
This will be my first night out
since I got back.

841
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:16,687
Hey, when you walk him, do you...?

842
00:46:17,495 --> 00:46:18,723
Do I what?

843
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:21,770
Do you pick it up?

844
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:25,451
Yes, I pick it up.

845
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:27,890
- You pick it up?
- Well, you have to.

846
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:30,774
Oh, boy, would I love to see that.

847
00:46:33,295 --> 00:46:34,808
Shut up!

848
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:37,170
Shut up, Farfel! Stop it!

849
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:38,768
I don't know what to do.

850
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:41,768
What if I take it to the pound,
then the guy shows up?

851
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:44,369
You should call the airline.
They might know where he is.

852
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,572
No, I tried. They don't know anything.
You gotta put the syrup in first.

853
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:49,930
- No, milk.
- I'm telling you. The guy's a drunk.

854
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:52,051
He's probably on a bender.

855
00:46:52,775 --> 00:46:54,731
What is a bender anyhow?

856
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,126
I don't know. They drink and they
bend things at the bar. I don't know.

857
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,970
I can't believe he hasn't called.

858
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,693
Two hundred seats on a plane...

859
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:07,291
...I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack
and his dog Cujo.

860
00:47:09,495 --> 00:47:10,723
Shut up!

861
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,204
One more day,
and you are pound-bound!

862
00:47:13,815 --> 00:47:15,726
Hey, I'm sorry. I can't
watch the dog tonight.

863
00:47:15,895 --> 00:47:17,886
- Why?
- We're going to the movies.

864
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:19,693
We're gonna see
Prognosis Negative.

865
00:47:19,855 --> 00:47:21,811
I can't. I gotta get this Ellen
out of my life.

866
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:24,614
- You're breaking up?
- Oh, yeah.

867
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,050
The sooner the better.
I can't wait to do it.

868
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:29,490
You know some people
you worry about whether or not...

869
00:47:29,655 --> 00:47:32,772
...you're gonna hurt their feelings?
With her, I'm looking forward to it.

870
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:34,334
Boy, I'd like to get it on video.

871
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:36,372
Watch it in slow motion
and freeze-frame it.

872
00:47:39,935 --> 00:47:42,369
Kramer, I don't know how you
lasted as long as you did.

873
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:43,883
You didn't like her?

874
00:47:44,055 --> 00:47:46,364
If you could see her personality...

875
00:47:46,535 --> 00:47:48,685
...it'd be like one of the
Elephant Man exhibits...

876
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:51,528
...where they pull off the sheet
and everyone gasps.

877
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:54,448
I can't believe someone
hasn't killed her yet.

878
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:56,328
How come you never said anything?

879
00:47:56,495 --> 00:47:59,089
You can't tell someone how you feel
about their girlfriend...

880
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,007
...till after they stop...
- I tell you.

881
00:48:01,175 --> 00:48:03,245
You. I'm talking about people.

882
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:06,927
Are we still going
to the movies tonight?

883
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:10,087
No, I can't. I gotta watch Farfel.
You and George can go without me.

884
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:12,810
- Just me and George?
- Sure.

885
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:14,249
But we need you.

886
00:48:14,415 --> 00:48:16,007
What do you need me for?

887
00:48:17,255 --> 00:48:18,893
Because.

888
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:23,367
- Yeah?
- Prognosis Negative.

889
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:26,848
Because I relate to George
through you.

890
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:28,573
We're more like...

891
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:32,523
...friends-in-law. Besides, we said
we'd see Prognosis Negative together.

892
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:34,765
Can't you put some newspapers
down or something?

893
00:48:34,935 --> 00:48:38,530
No, I can't trust him. He gets insane.
I won't enjoy myself.

894
00:48:39,175 --> 00:48:41,643
That's right, Farfel,
I'm talking about you!

895
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,809
Just me and George alone?

896
00:48:45,775 --> 00:48:50,053
Let's go, people. Let's go.
It's Prognosis Negative time.

897
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:51,888
I can't go.

898
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:55,247
- You can't go? Why not?
- Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

899
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:58,812
- I thought Kramer was watching him.
- He's breaking up with his girlfriend.

900
00:48:58,975 --> 00:49:00,852
What's the problem?
Just put newspaper down.

901
00:49:01,015 --> 00:49:03,051
No, I don't want that smell
in the house.

902
00:49:03,215 --> 00:49:05,445
- You spritz a little Lysol on it...
- No.

903
00:49:05,615 --> 00:49:07,094
It's like BO and cologne.

904
00:49:07,255 --> 00:49:11,407
They combine forces into some kind
of strange mutant funk.

905
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:12,849
So we're not going?

906
00:49:13,015 --> 00:49:14,573
Nah. You two go.

907
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,207
You still wanna go?

908
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:23,046
Do you?

909
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,808
If you want.

910
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:27,406
- It's... It's up to you.
- Go ahead.

911
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:33,364
Well, I really wanted to see
Prognosis Negative with Jerry.

912
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:36,003
You wanna see Ponce de Leon?

913
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:38,291
Ponce de Leon?

914
00:49:38,695 --> 00:49:40,048
Okay.

915
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:43,163
- You sure you don't wanna go?
- I want to, but I can't.

916
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:45,405
Oh! I tell you what.

917
00:49:45,575 --> 00:49:48,612
How about if I come back here first
and I clean everything up?

918
00:49:48,775 --> 00:49:51,448
And I open up the windows,
and if you're still not satisfied...

919
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,607
...we switch apartments for the night.
- No.

920
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:58,285
- What about this...?
- Forget it.

921
00:49:58,455 --> 00:50:00,491
Go ahead. You'll have a good time.

922
00:50:00,655 --> 00:50:03,408
- I know. It's not that.
- I just want you to go.

923
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:05,811
Well, thank you very much.

924
00:50:06,455 --> 00:50:09,811
I'm telling you, one more day,
stink breath!

925
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:12,364
On my block, a lot of people
walk their dogs...

926
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:15,891
...and I always see them walking
along with their little poop bags...

927
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,774
...which to me is just
the lowest function of human life.

928
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:22,450
If aliens are watching this
through telescopes...

929
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:25,493
...they're gonna think the dogs
are the leaders.

930
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:28,814
If you see two life forms,
one of them is making a poop...

931
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:31,887
...the other one's carrying it for him...

932
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:35,415
Who would you assume
is in charge?

933
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:44,287
So how long did you live there?

934
00:50:44,815 --> 00:50:46,612
About three years.

935
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:50,293
That's pretty long.

936
00:50:53,975 --> 00:50:56,284
- It's not that long, really.
- Yeah.

937
00:50:57,775 --> 00:50:59,333
- Do you...?
- So...

938
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:04,168
- And then you came here.
- Yeah.

939
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,209
So I've been here about six years.

940
00:51:11,455 --> 00:51:14,925
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90...

941
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:17,325
...'91.

942
00:51:19,015 --> 00:51:20,289
Yep.

943
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:21,729
Bad dog.

944
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:23,089
Bad dog!

945
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:24,847
You go outside!

946
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,892
Outside!

947
00:51:27,055 --> 00:51:29,410
What do you want from me? Tell me.

948
00:51:29,575 --> 00:51:31,531
Money? You want money?

949
00:51:31,695 --> 00:51:33,333
I'll give you money. How much?

950
00:51:33,495 --> 00:51:37,647
I must have been out of my mind.
Look at you.

951
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:40,375
Why don't you do something
with your life?

952
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:44,847
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

953
00:51:45,975 --> 00:51:48,364
You're just taking up space!

954
00:51:49,295 --> 00:51:52,605
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

955
00:51:53,975 --> 00:51:55,488
Wouldn't respect myself.

956
00:51:57,095 --> 00:51:59,006
I like herbal tea.

957
00:52:01,295 --> 00:52:03,445
Chamomile's good.

958
00:52:05,735 --> 00:52:07,566
Lemon Lift.

959
00:52:10,095 --> 00:52:11,926
Almond Pleasure.

960
00:52:25,535 --> 00:52:28,049
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

961
00:52:30,175 --> 00:52:32,848
- Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
- Yeah.

962
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:36,291
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

963
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:39,049
Jerry doesn't know
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

964
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,606
- You don't tell him?
- No.

965
00:52:42,775 --> 00:52:45,005
And you should see him.
Man, he gets all hyper.

966
00:52:45,175 --> 00:52:47,052
He doesn't even know why.
He loves it.

967
00:52:47,215 --> 00:52:49,809
He walks around going,
"God, I feel great!"

968
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:53,809
- You don't tell him?
- No.

969
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:57,645
- That is so funny.
- I know.

970
00:52:58,055 --> 00:52:59,408
Have you ever seen him throw up?

971
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:05,054
Please!

972
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,886
Please!

973
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,613
I take it all back!

974
00:53:10,775 --> 00:53:13,335
Everything. I take it all back!
Every word!

975
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:15,406
I love you!

976
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:18,086
I love you!

977
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:22,451
I can't live without you!
I'll do anything!

978
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:28,206
That's right. Gavin Palone.

979
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,969
What? You're sure?

980
00:53:31,135 --> 00:53:32,648
He was released on Monday?

981
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:34,771
Last Monday?

982
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,083
Did he leave a phone number
or address?

983
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,412
Unbelievable.

984
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:43,683
Well, thank you. Thanks.
Thanks very much.

985
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:47,811
That's it, Farfel. Party's over.

986
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:52,685
Start packing up your little squeeze
toys, buddy boy. You're checking out.

987
00:53:56,255 --> 00:53:59,088
It was weird because George
and I get along so great...

988
00:53:59,255 --> 00:54:00,483
...in so many situations...

989
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,169
...but this was the first time
we went one-on-one.

990
00:54:03,335 --> 00:54:06,133
One-on-one's a whole
different game. Can't pass off.

991
00:54:07,335 --> 00:54:10,532
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable
was when we were making fun of you.

992
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,485
Hello. Boy George, about time.

993
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,327
Beautiful. How soon?

994
00:54:19,495 --> 00:54:21,008
Okay, here's the plan:

995
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:25,009
We take the dog to the pound,
we go right to the movies.

996
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:27,530
Right. You, me and Elaine.

997
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:29,807
Yes, all three of us.

998
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:32,765
I am going.

999
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:35,244
Okay, see you in five minutes.

1000
00:54:42,815 --> 00:54:44,453
- What?
- Do you have to?

1001
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,413
What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to do it.

1002
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,486
I like dogs.

1003
00:54:49,655 --> 00:54:51,805
I'm not sure this is a dog.

1004
00:54:52,735 --> 00:54:54,851
You know the guy might have
just lost your number.

1005
00:54:55,015 --> 00:54:57,324
I'm in the book,
and I have a machine.

1006
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:00,851
Jerry, do you know what they do
to dogs at the pound?

1007
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:04,371
They keep them there for a week.
If nobody claims them, they kill them.

1008
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:05,809
Really?

1009
00:55:05,975 --> 00:55:07,727
How late are they open?

1010
00:55:13,175 --> 00:55:15,166
- What?
- What is it?

1011
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:17,970
I went back with Ellen.

1012
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:20,608
- That's great.
- Great.

1013
00:55:22,175 --> 00:55:23,688
- Terrific.
- Yeah.

1014
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:25,846
I really think you guys
are good together.

1015
00:55:26,015 --> 00:55:29,974
Yes. She understands you,
and she is not demanding.

1016
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:33,889
Do you think that I forgot
what you two said about her?

1017
00:55:34,055 --> 00:55:36,523
- We're just trying to be supportive.
- Yes.

1018
00:55:36,695 --> 00:55:38,447
- We knew you were upset...
- From now on...

1019
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:41,334
...when we pass each other,
I don't know you, you don't know me.

1020
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:44,443
Oh, Kramer. We didn't mean it.

1021
00:55:44,615 --> 00:55:47,254
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting my pot.

1022
00:55:48,055 --> 00:55:50,444
- Kramer, we like her.
- Kramer...

1023
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,850
What did we say that was so bad?

1024
00:55:55,015 --> 00:56:00,009
I believe I referred to her personality
as a potential science exhibit.

1025
00:56:00,575 --> 00:56:03,214
I said, " How come
no one's killed her?"

1026
00:56:05,255 --> 00:56:06,449
- Well.
- Well.

1027
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:08,367
Probably shouldn't have
said anything.

1028
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:11,095
I mean, everybody knows
the first breakup never takes.

1029
00:56:13,575 --> 00:56:17,170
- Yeah?
- Prognosis Negative.

1030
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:24,126
Great. Okay, Farfel,
put your shoes on.

1031
00:56:25,335 --> 00:56:27,485
Jerry, can't you just give it
one more day?

1032
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:30,169
- It's not his fault.
- It's not my dog.

1033
00:56:30,335 --> 00:56:32,212
I don't know where
this booze hound is.

1034
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:35,414
All right, I tell you what.

1035
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:38,009
How about if you and George
go to the movies...

1036
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:39,733
...and I stay here
and watch the dog?

1037
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:42,363
I can't let you do that.
What about Prognosis Negative?

1038
00:56:42,535 --> 00:56:44,446
We'll see it Sunday.

1039
00:56:45,455 --> 00:56:48,413
Tonight's the night, right?
Prognosis Negative.

1040
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:51,171
I'm not going.
I'm gonna watch the dog.

1041
00:56:51,695 --> 00:56:53,413
- What does this mean?
- Well...

1042
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:57,807
...we'll go see something else tonight.
We'll see Ponce de Leon.

1043
00:56:57,975 --> 00:57:00,853
What is with this dog? I thought
we were taking it to the pound.

1044
00:57:01,015 --> 00:57:02,653
She talked me into one more day.

1045
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:04,453
Talk. I'm going to the bathroom.

1046
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:07,049
Jerry, how long are you
gonna be in there?

1047
00:57:08,055 --> 00:57:10,888
I don't know, regular human time.

1048
00:57:11,055 --> 00:57:13,444
Why don't you wait
and go at the movies?

1049
00:57:15,495 --> 00:57:18,248
- Why shouldn't I go here?
- Well, you know.

1050
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:21,168
Sometimes it's good to get there
and make sure you get seats...

1051
00:57:21,335 --> 00:57:22,768
...and then go to the bathroom.

1052
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:25,085
- And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
- Yeah.

1053
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:29,975
Oh, yeah, George. Urinals are fun.

1054
00:57:31,735 --> 00:57:33,646
- Can I go?
- Hey, go.

1055
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:36,534
- Who's stopping you?
- What, are you doing me a favour?

1056
00:57:37,815 --> 00:57:40,375
Like we care if you go
to the bathroom.

1057
00:57:46,135 --> 00:57:48,091
- How's it going?
- Good.

1058
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:52,205
- You?
- Things are good.

1059
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:09,167
- Boy, he takes such a long time.
- I know.

1060
00:58:10,455 --> 00:58:12,446
You know what he does
in there? He gargles.

1061
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:14,446
Jerry gargles?
That why he takes so long?

1062
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:16,606
Yeah, he does it
like six times a day.

1063
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:19,370
- How come we never hear him?
- Because he does it quiet.

1064
00:58:19,535 --> 00:58:22,413
He does it quiet. Lookit...
Just like this. Watch.

1065
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:30,888
Wait, wait. Did you ever
see him throw up?

1066
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:33,966
We talked about that already.

1067
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:40,331
I have nothing to say
to anybody anymore.

1068
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,205
I'm so uninteresting.

1069
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,854
I'm think I'm out of conversation.

1070
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,485
So why do you call me
six times a day?

1071
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:50,126
All I know about is sports. That's it.

1072
00:58:50,295 --> 00:58:52,445
No matter how depressed,
I can always read sports.

1073
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:55,209
I could read the sports section
if my hair was on fire.

1074
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:59,054
You know what,
Ponce de Leon is sold out.

1075
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:02,884
It is. Oh, yeah, you're right.
What else is playing?

1076
00:59:03,055 --> 00:59:05,125
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.

1077
00:59:06,495 --> 00:59:08,804
Boy, I know she really wants
to see that with me.

1078
00:59:08,975 --> 00:59:10,613
Give me that jacket, mud face.

1079
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:12,527
This is not Seinfeld
you're dealing with.

1080
00:59:12,695 --> 00:59:15,687
When I get through with you,
you'll be begging to go to the pound.

1081
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:19,528
Shut up.

1082
00:59:20,335 --> 00:59:21,688
Shut up!

1083
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:24,333
Hello?

1084
00:59:25,015 --> 00:59:27,449
No. Who's calling?

1085
00:59:30,215 --> 00:59:33,048
Oh, my God. The dog guy.

1086
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:35,333
Well, where have you been?

1087
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:38,523
Yeah? Well, you better pick up
your dog tonight...

1088
00:59:38,695 --> 00:59:40,845
...or he has humped his last leg.

1089
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:46,329
I could understand if there was
something else playing...

1090
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:48,292
...but it's this or nothing.

1091
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:51,374
- I don't know what to do.
- What is this saving movies thing?

1092
00:59:51,535 --> 00:59:53,890
- Something's playing, you go.
- I know. I know.

1093
00:59:54,055 --> 00:59:55,374
So we're gonna do nothing now?

1094
00:59:55,535 --> 00:59:57,173
- This is crazy.
- It is kind of silly.

1095
00:59:57,335 --> 00:59:59,724
- Of course it is.
- I mean, it's just a movie...

1096
00:59:59,895 --> 01:00:02,534
- Exactly.
- It's not like she's in the movie.

1097
01:00:02,695 --> 01:00:03,889
Right.

1098
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:06,569
We're supposed to ruin the night
because she wants to see it?

1099
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:08,407
If I could have seen it
with her, fine.

1100
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,964
But I can't control these
circumstances and schedules...

1101
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,524
...and people's availabilities.
- She'll still see it.

1102
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,448
- You're not stopping her...
- How does sitting next to a person...

1103
01:00:16,615 --> 01:00:18,526
...in a movie theatre
increase the enjoyment?

1104
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:20,686
You can't talk during a movie.

1105
01:00:22,935 --> 01:00:24,163
This is stupid. Come on.

1106
01:00:24,335 --> 01:00:25,734
- Let's just go.
- Good.

1107
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:28,854
- Saving movies.
- Ridiculous.

1108
01:00:29,015 --> 01:00:31,483
Two for Prognosis Negative.

1109
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:36,647
- I'm in big trouble.
- Oh, you're dead.

1110
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,451
Bell's Palsy.

1111
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:45,494
The entire side of...
Of my face...

1112
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:47,885
...was paralysed.

1113
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:49,647
Farfel.

1114
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:53,573
You know, I couldn't... I couldn't...
I couldn't even feed myself.

1115
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:56,010
I was completely incapacitated.

1116
01:00:56,535 --> 01:00:58,093
Quiet, Farfel!

1117
01:00:58,255 --> 01:00:59,483
- Farfel.
- It's interesting...

1118
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:01,168
...because I called the hospital...

1119
01:01:01,335 --> 01:01:03,246
...and they said you were
released on Monday.

1120
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:06,044
Yes, that's true...

1121
01:01:06,215 --> 01:01:11,528
...but then, see, I was taken
to the Bell's Palsy Centre.

1122
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:14,206
In... In Rockville.

1123
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,969
Absolutely first...
First-rate facility.

1124
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,808
Top... Top-notch physicians.

1125
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,689
Hey, come on. Come on.
Get off me.

1126
01:01:22,855 --> 01:01:25,164
He won't hurt you. He's just playing.

1127
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:26,934
Now you keep that mutt
away from me.

1128
01:01:27,095 --> 01:01:30,451
Mutt? I'll wager his parents
are more pure than yours.

1129
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:33,327
Kramer, are you coming?

1130
01:01:33,495 --> 01:01:36,168
- Oh, hi, Ellen.
- Get in here.

1131
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,208
Listen, it's been a pleasure
taking care of your dog for a week...

1132
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:45,252
...but if you don't mind...

1133
01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:49,328
Prediction: You'll be calling me to ask
if you can come and visit him...

1134
01:01:49,495 --> 01:01:51,213
...before the month is out.

1135
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:55,689
Prediction: I never see you
or him again for the rest of my life.

1136
01:02:01,335 --> 01:02:02,927
We made plans.

1137
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:05,172
Why don't we just rent a movie?

1138
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:08,008
I thought you wanted to see
Prognosis Negative.

1139
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:13,124
No. It's supposed to be
really bad. Really bad.

1140
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:16,014
I mean, it's long. There's no story.

1141
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:20,532
It's so unbelievably boring...
I heard. I...

1142
01:02:21,895 --> 01:02:23,851
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

1143
01:02:24,015 --> 01:02:27,087
Well, George told me
the whole story, line for line.

1144
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:30,691
I almost feel like I've seen it already
and walked out on it.

1145
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:34,973
Wait. George saw the movie? I saw
him yesterday. He didn't mention it.

1146
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:37,287
You and George got together?

1147
01:02:37,455 --> 01:02:40,845
Yeah. I wanted to talk about how
we had nothing to talk about.

1148
01:02:42,695 --> 01:02:43,889
Hello.

1149
01:02:44,055 --> 01:02:45,329
Hi, hi, hi.

1150
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,723
What's up?

1151
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:48,374
Well, you were right.

1152
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:50,446
- About what?
- Ellen.

1153
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:53,175
We broke up again.

1154
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,808
Too bad.

1155
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:58,614
I thought she was the one.

1156
01:02:59,935 --> 01:03:01,971
I'll bring back the pot.

1157
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:04,533
Okay, come on. It's movie time.

1158
01:03:04,695 --> 01:03:06,765
- Hey, what are you gonna see?
- Prognosis Negative.

1159
01:03:06,935 --> 01:03:08,653
- That's supposed to be great.
- It's not.

1160
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:11,727
- Well, how do you know?
- I have an instinct for these things.

1161
01:03:11,895 --> 01:03:15,365
I had a parakeet when I was a kid.
That was the only pet I really enjoyed.

1162
01:03:15,695 --> 01:03:17,287
We used to let him out of his cage...

1163
01:03:17,455 --> 01:03:19,889
...and he would fly around.
And my mother had built...

1164
01:03:20,055 --> 01:03:23,252
One entire wall of our living room
was mirrored...

1165
01:03:23,415 --> 01:03:25,451
...she felt this gives you
a feeling of space.

1166
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:27,765
Have you ever heard this
interior-design principle?

1167
01:03:27,935 --> 01:03:30,165
The mirror makes it seem like
you have another room.

1168
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:31,734
Who walks up
to a mirror and goes:

1169
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:34,853
"Hey, look. There's a whole
other room in there.

1170
01:03:35,575 --> 01:03:38,294
There's a guy in there,
looks just like me"?

1171
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:43,412
But the parakeet will fall for this.
You let him out. He flies around.

1172
01:03:43,575 --> 01:03:46,931
Bang! With his little head.
He would just go:

1173
01:03:47,095 --> 01:03:50,405
I'd always think, even if he thinks
the mirror is another room...

1174
01:03:50,775 --> 01:03:54,973
...why doesn't he at least try and
avoid hitting the other parakeet?

1175
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:41,246
Subtitles by
SDI Media Group

1176
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,867
Does it seem to you
that the ventriloquist dummy...

1177
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:52,790
...has a very active sexual,
social life?

1178
01:04:53,234 --> 01:04:56,544
He's always talking about dates
and women that he knows...

1179
01:04:56,714 --> 01:04:58,909
...and bringing them back
to the suitcase at night.

1180
01:04:59,074 --> 01:05:02,430
There's always a sawdust joke
in there somewhere, you know.

1181
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:05,142
He says kinky things,
because he's made out of wood...

1182
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:06,827
...and he can spin his head around.

1183
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,947
We're somehow expected to believe...

1184
01:05:10,354 --> 01:05:12,914
...because the face is so animated...

1185
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:15,986
...they think we're not noticing
the feet are just swinging there.

1186
01:05:16,154 --> 01:05:18,224
Dummy feet never look
really right, do they?

1187
01:05:18,394 --> 01:05:21,909
They're just kind of dangling there.
Always kind of askew, you know.

1188
01:05:22,074 --> 01:05:23,427
You always see a little ankle.

1189
01:05:23,594 --> 01:05:26,506
Those little thin, fabric ankles
that they have, you know.

1190
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:29,393
You think,
"I don't think this thing is real."

1191
01:05:32,594 --> 01:05:34,550
Are you kidding me?

1192
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:36,830
Let me speak with the head librarian.
It's absurd.

1193
01:05:39,354 --> 01:05:43,063
An overdue book from 1971?

1194
01:05:43,234 --> 01:05:46,067
This is a joke, right? What are you,
from a radio station?

1195
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,829
Okay, you got me. I fell for it.

1196
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:51,633
All right. Okay.

1197
01:05:51,794 --> 01:05:54,069
I can be down there
in, like, a half-hour.

1198
01:05:54,234 --> 01:05:55,428
Bye.

1199
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:58,189
- What's the problem?
- This, you're not gonna believe.

1200
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,788
The New York Public Library...

1201
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:05,425
...says that I took out
Tropic of Cancer in 1971...

1202
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,152
...and never returned it.

1203
01:06:07,314 --> 01:06:09,874
Do you know how much
that comes to?

1204
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:12,429
That's a nickel a day for 20 years.

1205
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,869
- It's gonna be $50,000.
- It doesn't work like that.

1206
01:06:15,034 --> 01:06:16,945
If it's a dime a day,
it could be 100,000.

1207
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:18,706
It's not gonna be anything.

1208
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:21,229
I returned the book.
I remember it very vividly...

1209
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,191
...because I was with Sherry Becker.

1210
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,710
She wore this orange dress. It's the
first time I saw her in a dress like that.

1211
01:06:26,874 --> 01:06:30,071
I'd known her since ninth grade. She
was developing this body in secret...

1212
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:32,464
...under these loose clothes
for, like, two years.

1213
01:06:32,634 --> 01:06:34,113
And then one day...

1214
01:06:34,994 --> 01:06:37,110
...this orange dress.

1215
01:06:38,154 --> 01:06:41,908
- It's burned in my memory.
- Oh, memory burn, huh?

1216
01:06:42,074 --> 01:06:44,634
- I wonder whatever happened to her.
- How did they find you?

1217
01:06:44,954 --> 01:06:48,469
Oh, computers. They're cracking down
now on overdue books.

1218
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:51,512
The whole thing's
completely ridiculous.

1219
01:06:51,994 --> 01:06:55,509
It's George. Wait till he finds out we're
going to the library. He'll be thrilled.

1220
01:06:55,674 --> 01:06:59,030
- You know, I never got a library card.
- I'm coming down.

1221
01:06:59,194 --> 01:07:01,424
It's all a bunch of cheapskates
in there anyway.

1222
01:07:01,594 --> 01:07:03,505
People sitting around
reading the newspaper...

1223
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:06,188
...attached to those huge
wooden sticks...

1224
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:08,424
...trying to save a quarter.

1225
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:11,189
Look, I gotta go to the library.
You wanna go?

1226
01:07:11,354 --> 01:07:13,584
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

1227
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:25,867
The Dewey Decimal System.
What a scam that was.

1228
01:07:26,034 --> 01:07:30,232
Boy, this Dewey guy
really cleaned up on that deal.

1229
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:32,385
Where's George?

1230
01:07:32,794 --> 01:07:35,547
Look. Trying to save a quarter.

1231
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:39,229
I kind of like those sticks.
I'd like to get them in my house.

1232
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:47,263
This woman's completely
ignoring me.

1233
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:48,787
Look at her.

1234
01:07:48,954 --> 01:07:52,629
This is a lonely woman
looking for companionship.

1235
01:07:53,514 --> 01:07:55,470
A spinster.

1236
01:07:55,874 --> 01:07:57,910
Maybe a virgin.

1237
01:07:59,194 --> 01:08:03,312
Maybe she got hurt a long time ago.
She's a schoolgirl...

1238
01:08:03,474 --> 01:08:05,590
...there was a boy. It didn't work out.

1239
01:08:05,754 --> 01:08:10,623
So now she needs a little tenderness.
She needs a little understanding.

1240
01:08:10,794 --> 01:08:13,024
Needs a little Kramer, huh?

1241
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:18,553
Then she'll need
a little shot of penicillin.

1242
01:08:20,314 --> 01:08:22,066
- Yes?
- Yeah, I called before.

1243
01:08:22,234 --> 01:08:24,384
I got this notice in the mail.

1244
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:30,033
Tropic of Cancer. Henry Miller.

1245
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:35,031
This case has been turned over to our
investigations officer, Mr. Bookman.

1246
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,388
Bookman?

1247
01:08:36,554 --> 01:08:39,830
The library investigator's name is
actually Bookman?

1248
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:41,268
- Come on.
- It's true.

1249
01:08:41,434 --> 01:08:42,628
That's amazing.

1250
01:08:42,794 --> 01:08:45,752
That's like an ice-cream man
named Cone.

1251
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,269
Well, Lieutenant Bookman's
been working here 25 years...

1252
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:49,753
...so he's heard all the jokes.

1253
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:52,588
- Can I speak with this Bookman?
- Just a second.

1254
01:08:56,074 --> 01:08:58,224
Jerry.

1255
01:08:58,554 --> 01:08:59,748
What?

1256
01:09:00,514 --> 01:09:01,913
I think I saw him.

1257
01:09:02,074 --> 01:09:03,985
- I think it's him.
- Who?

1258
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:06,384
Did you see the homeless guy
on the library steps...

1259
01:09:06,554 --> 01:09:08,749
...screaming obscenities
and doing callisthenics?

1260
01:09:08,914 --> 01:09:12,065
- Yeah.
- I think that's Mr. Heyman.

1261
01:09:12,474 --> 01:09:14,066
The gym teacher from our high school.

1262
01:09:16,994 --> 01:09:19,588
- Heyman? Are you sure?
- He's older...

1263
01:09:19,754 --> 01:09:24,305
...completely covered in filth,
no whistle. But I think it's him.

1264
01:09:25,994 --> 01:09:27,985
George got him fired.
He squealed on him.

1265
01:09:28,154 --> 01:09:30,349
- Oh, tattletale.
- I didn't tattle.

1266
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:34,546
Well, what did this guy do?
What happened?

1267
01:09:34,714 --> 01:09:36,784
There was an incident.
I'd rather not discuss it.

1268
01:09:36,954 --> 01:09:39,024
- Oh, come on. You can tell me.
- Some other time.

1269
01:09:39,194 --> 01:09:40,991
What, tonight?

1270
01:09:42,074 --> 01:09:45,908
- I never figured you for a squealer.
- He sang like a canary.

1271
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:47,712
- Mr. Bookman's not here.
- Not here?

1272
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:51,025
- Why was I told to come down here?
- He'll be out all afternoon on a case.

1273
01:09:51,194 --> 01:09:54,231
He's out on a case?
He actually goes out on cases?

1274
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:56,473
What am I supposed to do now?

1275
01:09:56,634 --> 01:09:58,511
I'll have Mr. Bookman
get in touch with you.

1276
01:09:59,354 --> 01:10:00,992
All right. Thanks.

1277
01:10:01,154 --> 01:10:03,304
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go see if it's Heyman.

1278
01:10:03,474 --> 01:10:07,467
- It's not him.
- Hey, I'll see you boys later, huh?

1279
01:10:11,714 --> 01:10:15,992
So, what's a guy gotta do around here
to get a library card?

1280
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:29,227
- Where's Karen?
- She went to pick up lunch.

1281
01:10:30,554 --> 01:10:31,748
Well...

1282
01:10:32,594 --> 01:10:34,869
...she didn't ask me what I wanted.

1283
01:10:35,034 --> 01:10:37,264
She must've forgot.

1284
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:40,190
How could she forget?
I've been ordering lunch...

1285
01:10:40,354 --> 01:10:42,072
...every day for three and a half years.

1286
01:10:42,954 --> 01:10:44,751
Is there something
you're not telling me...

1287
01:10:44,914 --> 01:10:47,030
...because I'm getting, like,
a really weird vibe.

1288
01:10:48,274 --> 01:10:50,310
Is Lippman getting rid of me?
You can tell me.

1289
01:10:50,474 --> 01:10:53,068
- I won't say anything.
- I don't know anything.

1290
01:10:54,354 --> 01:10:56,504
You don't know. You see,
"I don't know anything"...

1291
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:59,586
...means there's something to know.
If you really didn't, you'd say:

1292
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:01,346
"You're crazy."

1293
01:11:01,514 --> 01:11:04,392
- Oh, hi, Mr. Lippman.
- Elaine.

1294
01:11:05,874 --> 01:11:07,910
I was wondering
if you got a chance...

1295
01:11:08,074 --> 01:11:11,032
...to look at that biography
of Columbus I gave you.

1296
01:11:11,194 --> 01:11:12,991
Yes, I did.

1297
01:11:14,194 --> 01:11:16,025
Yes, I did.

1298
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:21,347
- Marie, this water is still too cold.
- Oh, yeah. It's freezing.

1299
01:11:23,354 --> 01:11:25,504
Hurts your teeth.

1300
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:32,544
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

1301
01:11:32,714 --> 01:11:36,184
He never likes anything I recommend,
and then that lunch thing.

1302
01:11:36,354 --> 01:11:38,390
So they forgot to get your lunch.
Big deal.

1303
01:11:38,554 --> 01:11:41,273
What do you know?
You've never worked in an office.

1304
01:11:41,434 --> 01:11:43,789
See, you've worked in an office,
George. You understand.

1305
01:11:43,954 --> 01:11:47,185
Jerry thinks I'm overreacting,
but you understand lunch.

1306
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:49,988
I don't understand lunch.
I don't know anything about it.

1307
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:53,903
Just because I got the guy fired doesn't
mean I turned him into a bum, does it?

1308
01:11:54,074 --> 01:11:55,553
- What did he do?
- He purposely...

1309
01:11:55,714 --> 01:11:57,466
...mispronounced my name.

1310
01:11:57,634 --> 01:11:59,431
Instead of saying Costanza...

1311
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:03,826
...he'd say, " Can't stand you.
Can't stand you."

1312
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:07,232
Remember, he made me smell
my own gym socks once?

1313
01:12:07,394 --> 01:12:11,148
I remember he made you wear a jock
on your head for a whole class.

1314
01:12:11,514 --> 01:12:14,745
- And the straps were hanging down...
- Okay, okay.

1315
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,313
You never even had him for gym.

1316
01:12:16,474 --> 01:12:18,863
I had him for hygiene.
Remember his teeth?

1317
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,104
It was like from an exhumed corpse.

1318
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:23,988
Little baked beans.

1319
01:12:25,434 --> 01:12:28,312
Come on, tell me what happened.

1320
01:12:28,954 --> 01:12:30,706
Well, okay.

1321
01:12:30,874 --> 01:12:33,342
As I said, the guy had it in for me.

1322
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:37,063
He actually failed me in gym. Me.

1323
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:40,472
And those spastic Schnitzer twins.

1324
01:12:40,754 --> 01:12:42,984
- Can't stand you!
- Yes, Mr. Heyman?

1325
01:12:43,154 --> 01:12:46,146
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

1326
01:12:46,314 --> 01:12:48,305
Well, that's because
I wear boxer shorts.

1327
01:12:48,474 --> 01:12:50,066
Boxer shorts, huh?

1328
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:52,304
- What brand?
- I'm not really sure. l...

1329
01:12:52,474 --> 01:12:54,749
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

1330
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,427
He gave me a wedgie.

1331
01:12:57,594 --> 01:12:59,664
And he got fired the next day.

1332
01:12:59,994 --> 01:13:01,427
Why do they call it a "wedgie"?

1333
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:05,143
Because the underwear is pulled up
from the back until it...

1334
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:07,145
...wedges in.

1335
01:13:07,914 --> 01:13:10,553
They also have an atomic wedgie.

1336
01:13:10,714 --> 01:13:13,945
Now, the goal there is to actually
get the waistband...

1337
01:13:14,114 --> 01:13:16,150
...on top of the head.

1338
01:13:16,354 --> 01:13:18,345
It's very rare.

1339
01:13:19,474 --> 01:13:21,942
- Boys are sick.
- Well, what do girls do?

1340
01:13:22,114 --> 01:13:25,789
We just tease someone till they
develop an eating disorder.

1341
01:13:27,114 --> 01:13:29,230
I gotta go back to the library
and talk to him.

1342
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:32,227
I gotta find out if I'm the guy
that ruined his life.

1343
01:13:32,394 --> 01:13:34,225
Hey, babaloo, you better get home.

1344
01:13:34,394 --> 01:13:37,067
This guy Bookman from the library,
he's waiting for you.

1345
01:13:38,034 --> 01:13:39,513
What's amazing about the library...

1346
01:13:39,674 --> 01:13:41,505
...is here's a place
where you can go in...

1347
01:13:41,674 --> 01:13:44,188
...take out any book you want.
They just give it to you...

1348
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:46,822
...and say, " Bring it back
when you're done."

1349
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:49,588
Reminds you of that pathetic friend
everybody had as a kid...

1350
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:53,303
...that would let you borrow any of his
stuff if you would just be his friend.

1351
01:13:53,474 --> 01:13:57,262
That's what the library is. It's
a government-funded pathetic friend.

1352
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,345
That's why everybody
bullies the library.

1353
01:13:59,514 --> 01:14:01,744
"I'll bring it back on time,
I'll bring it back late.

1354
01:14:01,914 --> 01:14:04,269
What are you gonna do,
charge me a nickel?"

1355
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:08,349
I'm glad you're here so we can
straighten this out.

1356
01:14:08,514 --> 01:14:09,867
- Cup of tea?
- Got any coffee?

1357
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:11,103
- Coffee?
- Yeah, coffee.

1358
01:14:11,274 --> 01:14:13,105
- No, I don't drink coffee.
- You don't?

1359
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:15,026
- How about instant coffee?
- No, I don't...

1360
01:14:15,194 --> 01:14:16,946
- No instant coffee?
- Well, I don't...

1361
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:19,150
- Who doesn't have instant coffee?
- I don't.

1362
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:22,545
Buy a jar of Folgers crystals, put it in
the cupboard, you forget about it.

1363
01:14:22,714 --> 01:14:24,670
When you need it, it's there.
It lasts forever.

1364
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:27,302
It's freeze-dried.
Freeze-dried crystals.

1365
01:14:28,874 --> 01:14:30,546
Really? I'll have to remember that.

1366
01:14:30,874 --> 01:14:34,184
- You took this book out in 1971.
- Yes, and I returned it in 1971.

1367
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:36,743
Yeah, '71, that was my first year
on the job.

1368
01:14:36,914 --> 01:14:39,508
Bad year for libraries.
Bad year for America.

1369
01:14:40,154 --> 01:14:41,985
Hippies burning library cards.

1370
01:14:42,154 --> 01:14:44,714
Abbie Hoffman telling everybody
to steal books.

1371
01:14:45,034 --> 01:14:47,343
I don't judge a man by hair length
or musical taste.

1372
01:14:47,514 --> 01:14:48,708
Rock was never my bag.

1373
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:52,106
But you put on a pair of shoes
in the New York Public Library, fella.

1374
01:14:52,274 --> 01:14:54,424
Look, Mr. Bookman...

1375
01:14:56,154 --> 01:14:58,827
...I returned that book.
I remember it very specifically.

1376
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,950
You're a comedian.
You make people laugh.

1377
01:15:01,114 --> 01:15:03,628
- I try.
- You think this is all a big joke?

1378
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:06,833
No, I don't.

1379
01:15:06,994 --> 01:15:09,588
I saw you on TV once.
I remembered your name from my list.

1380
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:12,143
I looked it up.
Sure enough, it checked out.

1381
01:15:12,314 --> 01:15:15,306
You think because you're a celebrity,
somehow the law doesn't apply?

1382
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:17,226
- You're above the law?
- Certainly not.

1383
01:15:17,394 --> 01:15:19,828
Well, let me tell you something,
funny boy.

1384
01:15:20,234 --> 01:15:23,306
You know that little stamp, the one
that says "New York Public Library"?

1385
01:15:23,474 --> 01:15:24,953
That may not mean anything to you.

1386
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:27,503
But that means a lot to me.
One whole hell of a lot.

1387
01:15:27,674 --> 01:15:30,746
Sure, go ahead. Laugh if you want to.
I've seen your type before.

1388
01:15:30,914 --> 01:15:34,543
Flashy, making a scene,
flaunting convention.

1389
01:15:34,714 --> 01:15:36,227
Yeah, I know what you're thinking:

1390
01:15:36,394 --> 01:15:39,033
"Why's this guy making such a stink
about old library books?"

1391
01:15:39,594 --> 01:15:42,062
Well, let me give you a hint, junior.

1392
01:15:42,554 --> 01:15:45,626
Maybe we can live without libraries,
people like you and me. Maybe.

1393
01:15:45,794 --> 01:15:47,830
Sure, we're too old
to change the world.

1394
01:15:47,994 --> 01:15:50,872
But what about that kid sitting down
opening a book right now...

1395
01:15:51,034 --> 01:15:52,945
...in a branch at the local library...

1396
01:15:53,114 --> 01:15:56,470
...and finding drawings
of pee-pees and wee-wees...

1397
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:01,863
...in The Cat in the Hat
and The Five Chinese Brothers?

1398
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,228
Doesn't he deserve better?

1399
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:06,545
Look, if you think this is about
overdue fines and missing books...

1400
01:16:06,714 --> 01:16:09,274
...you better think again.
This is about that kid's right...

1401
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:11,664
...to read a book without
getting his mind warped.

1402
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:13,870
Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld.

1403
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:17,788
Maybe that's how you get your kicks,
you and your good-time buddies.

1404
01:16:17,954 --> 01:16:20,787
Well, I got a flash for you, joy-boy:

1405
01:16:24,034 --> 01:16:25,262
Party time is over.

1406
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:28,987
You got seven days, Seinfeld.

1407
01:16:29,594 --> 01:16:31,744
That is one week.

1408
01:16:36,554 --> 01:16:39,864
- What's wrong?
- It's Bookman, the library cop.

1409
01:16:40,314 --> 01:16:43,033
- So? I didn't do anything wrong.
- I'm supposed to be at work.

1410
01:16:43,194 --> 01:16:46,504
I could get fired.
I never should've come here.

1411
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:50,143
Why don't you leave?

1412
01:16:53,354 --> 01:16:55,743
I can't.

1413
01:16:57,194 --> 01:17:01,904
There's no way I'm paying that!
I returned that book in 1971!

1414
01:17:02,074 --> 01:17:04,429
I have a witness. Sherry Becker.

1415
01:17:04,594 --> 01:17:06,983
She wore an orange dress.

1416
01:17:07,154 --> 01:17:08,792
She gave me a piece
of Black Jack gum.

1417
01:17:08,954 --> 01:17:12,185
I said, " Liquorice gum.
What will they think of next?"

1418
01:17:12,354 --> 01:17:13,992
I remember it!

1419
01:17:19,274 --> 01:17:21,344
Becker, Becker...

1420
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:34,672
Kevin went to a public school.

1421
01:17:34,834 --> 01:17:36,313
He's the 14 year old.

1422
01:17:36,474 --> 01:17:39,386
We were gonna send Marsha
to a private school...

1423
01:17:39,794 --> 01:17:42,388
...because in some ways, they don't...

1424
01:17:42,554 --> 01:17:45,273
...learn enough, I think.

1425
01:17:45,434 --> 01:17:48,949
So, Sherry, what do you remember
about that day at the library?

1426
01:17:49,594 --> 01:17:52,631
I remember it like it was yesterday.

1427
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,705
It was a Friday afternoon.

1428
01:17:54,874 --> 01:17:58,105
- I wore a purple dress.
- Purple?

1429
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,788
- You sure it wasn't orange?
- Positive.

1430
01:18:00,954 --> 01:18:03,673
And I was chewing Dentyne.

1431
01:18:03,834 --> 01:18:06,871
I always chewed Dentyne.

1432
01:18:07,034 --> 01:18:09,912
Remember, Jerry? Dentyne?

1433
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:15,342
- No Black Jack?
- Liquorice gum? Never.

1434
01:18:15,514 --> 01:18:17,266
What else?

1435
01:18:17,594 --> 01:18:18,788
We were...

1436
01:18:18,954 --> 01:18:23,027
...reading passages to each other
from that Henry Miller book you had.

1437
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:25,754
- Tropic of Cancer.
- No.

1438
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:27,506
Tropic of Capricorn.

1439
01:18:28,034 --> 01:18:32,073
- Tropic of Capricorn?
- Remember?

1440
01:18:32,394 --> 01:18:34,703
"What holds the world together...

1441
01:18:34,874 --> 01:18:38,947
...as I have learned from
bitter experience...

1442
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:42,186
...is sexual intercourse."

1443
01:18:45,674 --> 01:18:48,950
Wait a second, wait a second.
You're right. I had both of them.

1444
01:18:49,114 --> 01:18:50,672
We read from Tropic of Capricorn.

1445
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:54,713
I was all set to return Tropic of Cancer.
And then...

1446
01:18:55,754 --> 01:18:57,551
- George, here's the book.
- Oh, man.

1447
01:18:57,714 --> 01:19:00,148
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

1448
01:19:00,314 --> 01:19:02,908
Jerry, it's me, George. Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.

1449
01:19:03,074 --> 01:19:06,384
All right. I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.

1450
01:19:08,314 --> 01:19:10,987
- Where are you going?
- It was nice seeing you again.

1451
01:19:11,154 --> 01:19:13,065
I just remembered something.
I've gotta go.

1452
01:19:14,234 --> 01:19:16,589
It was George!

1453
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:20,351
Read another poem.

1454
01:19:20,634 --> 01:19:24,513
Pressed chest
Fleshed out west

1455
01:19:24,674 --> 01:19:26,665
Might be the saviour

1456
01:19:26,834 --> 01:19:28,472
Or a garden pest

1457
01:19:29,674 --> 01:19:33,223
That is great poetry.
You should be published.

1458
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,271
It's great.

1459
01:19:37,634 --> 01:19:40,148
Well, the library's kind of a cool place
when it's closed.

1460
01:19:40,314 --> 01:19:42,703
Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet.

1461
01:19:42,874 --> 01:19:44,387
Listen to the echo.

1462
01:19:44,554 --> 01:19:46,306
- Hello!
- Hello!

1463
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:48,749
- Hello!
- Hello!

1464
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:50,393
- Hello!
- Hello.

1465
01:19:53,834 --> 01:19:55,028
Mr. Bookman.

1466
01:19:55,194 --> 01:19:58,550
I remember when the librarian was
a much older woman.

1467
01:19:58,714 --> 01:20:01,274
Kindly, discreet, unattractive.

1468
01:20:01,874 --> 01:20:03,830
We didn't know anything
about her private life.

1469
01:20:03,994 --> 01:20:06,064
We didn't wanna know
about her private life.

1470
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,623
She didn't have a private life.

1471
01:20:08,794 --> 01:20:10,705
When you think about that,
think about this:

1472
01:20:10,874 --> 01:20:13,434
The library closes at 5:00,
no exceptions.

1473
01:20:13,594 --> 01:20:15,266
This is your final warning.

1474
01:20:15,434 --> 01:20:17,743
Got that, kewpie doll?

1475
01:20:21,674 --> 01:20:24,268
Lippman wants to see me
in his office.

1476
01:20:24,434 --> 01:20:28,143
- See me. That can't be good.
- Maybe you're getting a raise.

1477
01:20:28,314 --> 01:20:30,703
Maybe I'm getting a wedgie.

1478
01:20:34,074 --> 01:20:36,030
- What?
- It's George.

1479
01:20:36,194 --> 01:20:40,267
- George is on his way up.
- Wait till I tell him about the book.

1480
01:20:41,674 --> 01:20:43,471
Are you okay?

1481
01:20:43,634 --> 01:20:48,788
- What?
- It's... It's Marion's poetry.

1482
01:20:48,954 --> 01:20:52,469
- I can't take it!
- Oh, Kramer.

1483
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:59,194
Remember that biography
I recommended?

1484
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,743
- My boss hated it!
- I'm right here.

1485
01:21:01,914 --> 01:21:03,825
Oh, sorry.

1486
01:21:04,634 --> 01:21:08,946
- Remember that Columbus book?
- Columbus. Eurotrash.

1487
01:21:20,754 --> 01:21:23,029
Well, it's definitely him.

1488
01:21:25,154 --> 01:21:28,464
- Him? Him who?
- Him who?

1489
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,386
Heyman him.

1490
01:21:30,554 --> 01:21:32,306
Heyman, the gym teacher?

1491
01:21:32,474 --> 01:21:35,307
- You found him?
- Oh, I found him.

1492
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,590
He was sitting on the steps
of the library.

1493
01:21:37,754 --> 01:21:39,028
I sat down next to him.

1494
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,706
He smelled like the locker room
after that game against Erasmus.

1495
01:21:42,874 --> 01:21:44,751
That was double overtime.

1496
01:21:44,994 --> 01:21:46,666
I said, " Mr. Heyman...

1497
01:21:46,834 --> 01:21:49,348
...it's me, George Costanza.

1498
01:21:49,514 --> 01:21:51,948
JFK, '71."

1499
01:21:52,114 --> 01:21:53,991
He doesn't move.

1500
01:21:54,194 --> 01:21:55,832
So I said:

1501
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:59,987
"Can't stand you. Can't stand you."

1502
01:22:00,354 --> 01:22:02,948
He turns and smiles.

1503
01:22:03,114 --> 01:22:05,753
The little baked-bean teeth.

1504
01:22:06,234 --> 01:22:08,304
I get up to run away...

1505
01:22:08,474 --> 01:22:11,784
...but something was holding me back.

1506
01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:14,545
It was Heyman.

1507
01:22:16,314 --> 01:22:18,066
He had my underwear.

1508
01:22:20,794 --> 01:22:25,584
Here I was on the steps
of the 42nd Street library...

1509
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:27,949
...a grown man...

1510
01:22:28,634 --> 01:22:30,465
...getting a wedgie.

1511
01:22:32,794 --> 01:22:34,193
At least it wasn't atomic.

1512
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:38,145
It was.

1513
01:22:41,954 --> 01:22:46,072
So, Georgie boy, guess what
happened to Tropic of Cancer.

1514
01:22:46,234 --> 01:22:48,543
- How should I know?
- Because I gave it to you.

1515
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:49,908
- Me?
- Yeah, think.

1516
01:22:50,074 --> 01:22:52,349
Don't you remember?
You kept begging me to see it.

1517
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:54,232
Then finally, I agreed.

1518
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:57,188
You were supposed to return it.

1519
01:22:57,354 --> 01:23:00,312
I met you in the gym locker room
and gave it to you.

1520
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:02,468
The locker room.

1521
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:05,071
- George, here's the book.
- Oh, man.

1522
01:23:05,234 --> 01:23:07,668
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

1523
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:10,143
It's me, George. Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.

1524
01:23:10,314 --> 01:23:13,829
All right. I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.

1525
01:23:17,594 --> 01:23:19,630
- Can't stand you!
- Yes, Mr. Heyman?

1526
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,104
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

1527
01:23:23,274 --> 01:23:26,391
- That's because I wear boxer shorts.
- Boxer shorts, huh?

1528
01:23:26,554 --> 01:23:28,624
- What brand?
- I'm not really sure.

1529
01:23:28,794 --> 01:23:31,024
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

1530
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:46,870
Anyway, I hope there's
no hard feelings.

1531
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:51,625
Hard feelings? What do you know
about hard feelings?

1532
01:23:53,714 --> 01:23:56,831
Ever have a man die in your arms?
Ever kill somebody?

1533
01:23:56,994 --> 01:23:59,064
- What is your problem?
- What's my problem?

1534
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:01,873
Punks like you. That's my problem.

1535
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:03,672
You better not
screw up again, Seinfeld.

1536
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:06,871
Because if you do, I'll be all over you
like a pit bull on a poodle.

1537
01:24:10,234 --> 01:24:13,032
That is one tough monkey.

1538
01:24:13,914 --> 01:24:17,748
- So you were saying?
- So I took your suggestion...

1539
01:24:17,914 --> 01:24:20,144
...and I gave my boss
Marion's poems...

1540
01:24:20,314 --> 01:24:22,066
...the ones that affected
Kramer so much.

1541
01:24:22,234 --> 01:24:26,193
- Oh, beautiful. Did he like them?
- No, he didn't.

1542
01:24:27,554 --> 01:24:30,273
No, he didn't.

1543
01:24:31,994 --> 01:24:35,031
- Was he out there?
- No, he's gone.

1544
01:24:35,514 --> 01:24:39,348
- I wonder what happened to him.
- I guess we'll never know.

1545
01:24:46,074 --> 01:24:47,507
Can't stand you.

1546
01:24:47,674 --> 01:24:52,111
Can't stand you. Can't stand you.

1547
01:24:52,274 --> 01:24:54,834
Can't stand you.

1548
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,949
Any day that you had gym...

1549
01:24:59,114 --> 01:25:01,230
...was a weird school day.

1550
01:25:01,394 --> 01:25:03,589
You know what I mean?
It started off kind of normal.

1551
01:25:03,754 --> 01:25:06,552
You have, like, English, geometry,
social studies...

1552
01:25:06,714 --> 01:25:09,786
...and then suddenly, you're, like,
in Lord of the Flies for 40 minutes.

1553
01:25:09,954 --> 01:25:13,026
You're hanging from a rope.
You have hardly any clothes on.

1554
01:25:13,194 --> 01:25:16,470
Teachers are yelling at you,
"Where's your jockstrap?" You know.

1555
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:20,752
Kids are throwing dodge balls at you.
You're trying to survive.

1556
01:25:21,194 --> 01:25:22,866
Then it's history...

1557
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:24,831
...science, language.

1558
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:28,145
There's something off
in the whole flow of that day.

1559
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,785

1560
01:26:22,173 --> 01:26:24,733
I have never seen an old person
in a new bathing suit...

1561
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:27,851
...in my life. I don't know where
they get their bathing suits.

1562
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:31,132
But my father has bathing suits
from other centuries.

1563
01:26:31,293 --> 01:26:32,646
My parents live in Florida.

1564
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:35,611
And if you go down there and
you forget your bathing suit...

1565
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:38,162
...then they want you
to wear one of theirs.

1566
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:39,812
You know how that gets?

1567
01:26:39,973 --> 01:26:42,771
"You need trunks, son?
I got trunks for you.

1568
01:26:42,933 --> 01:26:44,730
You can wear my trunks."

1569
01:26:44,893 --> 01:26:47,487
Fathers don't wear bathing
suits, they wear trunks.

1570
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:51,043
It's kind of the same thing a tree
would wear if it went swimming.

1571
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,929
So I get in the water in this thing,
and it's, like, floating around me...

1572
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:56,845
...somewhere.

1573
01:26:57,013 --> 01:26:59,288
You ever put on a bathing suit
that you don't know...

1574
01:26:59,453 --> 01:27:01,523
...exactly where you are
inside the bathing suit?

1575
01:27:01,693 --> 01:27:03,843
You bump into somebody,
"No, I'm parasailing.

1576
01:27:04,013 --> 01:27:05,924
I'm waiting for the boat
to come back."

1577
01:27:12,013 --> 01:27:14,243
It was supposed to be here at 7:30.

1578
01:27:14,413 --> 01:27:17,052
- Call the airlines again.
- What happened to the Scotch tape?

1579
01:27:17,213 --> 01:27:18,692
Who takes the Scotch tape?

1580
01:27:18,853 --> 01:27:21,287
Nobody returns anything
around here.

1581
01:27:21,453 --> 01:27:22,966
Oh, I think that's them.

1582
01:27:23,133 --> 01:27:24,691
Know what I'll do next time?

1583
01:27:24,853 --> 01:27:26,332
I'll hide it so nobody can find it.

1584
01:27:28,813 --> 01:27:30,326
- Hi! Welcome!
- Hi!

1585
01:27:30,493 --> 01:27:31,972
- Welcome.
- How are you?

1586
01:27:32,133 --> 01:27:35,330
- Welcome to Florida!
- Hi, Mr. Seinfeld.

1587
01:27:35,493 --> 01:27:37,768
Hey, there's the old man.

1588
01:27:37,933 --> 01:27:40,288
So, what took you so long?

1589
01:27:40,453 --> 01:27:42,887
We waited 35 minutes
in the rent-a-car place.

1590
01:27:43,053 --> 01:27:45,203
I don't know why.
We would have picked you up.

1591
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:47,523
- What's the difference?
- You could use our car.

1592
01:27:47,693 --> 01:27:49,126
I don't want to use your car.

1593
01:27:49,293 --> 01:27:51,329
- What's wrong with our car?
- Nothing. It's fine.

1594
01:27:51,493 --> 01:27:53,211
- What if you want to use it?
- We don't.

1595
01:27:53,373 --> 01:27:56,092
- What? We use it.
- lf you were using it, we wouldn't.

1596
01:27:56,253 --> 01:27:57,481
So, what, you'd hitch?

1597
01:27:57,653 --> 01:28:00,087
- How much is a rent-a-car?
- I don't know, 25 bucks a day.

1598
01:28:00,253 --> 01:28:03,131
- What? Oh, you're crazy.
- Plus the insurance.

1599
01:28:03,293 --> 01:28:04,726
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

1600
01:28:04,893 --> 01:28:07,043
How could you not
get the insurance?

1601
01:28:07,493 --> 01:28:08,687
We'll pay for the car.

1602
01:28:08,853 --> 01:28:10,889
- You're not paying for it.
- Morty.

1603
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:13,930
God, it's so hot in here.

1604
01:28:15,653 --> 01:28:17,405
Why don't you put on
the air conditioning?

1605
01:28:17,573 --> 01:28:21,202
You don't need the air conditioner.
Do you have your speech all ready?

1606
01:28:21,373 --> 01:28:22,965
Do I have to make a speech?

1607
01:28:23,133 --> 01:28:25,772
Of course. They're giving
a testimonial for your father.

1608
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:28,003
- You could do your comic routines.
- Oh, yeah.

1609
01:28:28,173 --> 01:28:30,812
That'll go over real well
with that crowd.

1610
01:28:31,053 --> 01:28:32,645
You have a lake.

1611
01:28:32,973 --> 01:28:34,725
- The lake isn't real.
- The lake is real.

1612
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,485
Are you kidding? They built the lake.

1613
01:28:36,653 --> 01:28:39,167
But it's real, it's water.

1614
01:28:40,053 --> 01:28:42,965
- Where are you going with those?
- I'll put Elaine's stuff in here.

1615
01:28:43,133 --> 01:28:44,964
Don't sleep in there.
Sleep in the bedroom.

1616
01:28:45,413 --> 01:28:46,732
I can't take your bedroom.

1617
01:28:46,893 --> 01:28:50,010
- I'm up at 6:00 in the morning.
- I can't kick you out of your bed.

1618
01:28:50,173 --> 01:28:52,164
We don't even sleep.

1619
01:28:52,613 --> 01:28:54,729
- Ma.
- It's a sofa bed.

1620
01:28:54,893 --> 01:28:56,804
- You'll be uncomfortable.
- What about you?

1621
01:28:56,973 --> 01:28:58,167
Why should I be comfortable?

1622
01:28:59,413 --> 01:29:01,483
- What about him?
- Don't worry. He's comfortable.

1623
01:29:01,653 --> 01:29:03,609
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.

1624
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:08,089
- Will you stop?
- Yeah, I'll just stay in here.

1625
01:29:08,853 --> 01:29:10,571
Jerry.

1626
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:16,086
Jerry, you don't have to stay
on the couch on my account.

1627
01:29:16,253 --> 01:29:19,131
- You two can stay in there together.
- That's not a good idea.

1628
01:29:19,293 --> 01:29:22,012
- I thought that you...
- Not now. She's right inside.

1629
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:23,526
What happened?

1630
01:29:23,773 --> 01:29:26,571
I don't know. We decided we
don't really work as a couple.

1631
01:29:26,933 --> 01:29:28,969
- What does that mean?
- Well...

1632
01:29:29,133 --> 01:29:30,964
Why are you whispering?

1633
01:29:31,493 --> 01:29:33,449
- Nothing, nothing.
- Elaine.

1634
01:29:33,613 --> 01:29:35,569
- What about her?
- Would you please be...?

1635
01:29:37,173 --> 01:29:39,926
You know, look at the
sun-dried tomatoes.

1636
01:29:40,093 --> 01:29:42,288
Where were they five years ago?

1637
01:29:42,453 --> 01:29:44,808
It just goes to show you,
you never know what...

1638
01:29:45,053 --> 01:29:47,203
What, you know, could happen...

1639
01:29:47,653 --> 01:29:50,963
...to a vegetable. It could just
take right off at any time.

1640
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:56,085
We've tried all kinds
of arrangements...

1641
01:29:56,253 --> 01:29:58,892
...but we can't seem to be friends
when we sleep together.

1642
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:01,567
Why do you need more friends?

1643
01:30:01,733 --> 01:30:03,212
You've got plenty of friends.

1644
01:30:03,533 --> 01:30:06,491
- He's an idealist.
- What are you looking for?

1645
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:09,167
- I'm looking. I like looking.
- He likes looking.

1646
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:10,846
- So look.
- But how long can you look?

1647
01:30:11,013 --> 01:30:13,004
I'm going for the record.

1648
01:30:15,133 --> 01:30:17,772
Your father wouldn't say so,
but he's really glad you came.

1649
01:30:17,933 --> 01:30:19,844
- Oh, come on.
- This is a big thing for him.

1650
01:30:20,013 --> 01:30:22,402
Outgoing president
of the condo association.

1651
01:30:26,173 --> 01:30:28,562
So they arrived safely.

1652
01:30:28,733 --> 01:30:31,088
- Remember Jack and Doris?
- Nice to see you.

1653
01:30:31,253 --> 01:30:32,845
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.

1654
01:30:33,013 --> 01:30:34,412
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Hello.

1655
01:30:34,573 --> 01:30:36,325
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hey, Jerry...

1656
01:30:36,493 --> 01:30:39,053
...you came all the way
down here for this?

1657
01:30:39,213 --> 01:30:40,487
And scuba diving.

1658
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:42,564
Scuba diving?
Who's going scuba diving?

1659
01:30:42,733 --> 01:30:44,564
We're going. We'll be back in time.

1660
01:30:44,733 --> 01:30:46,451
What do you have to go
scuba diving for?

1661
01:30:46,613 --> 01:30:48,410
- For fun.
- For fun?

1662
01:30:48,573 --> 01:30:50,245
Jack, have some sponge cake.

1663
01:30:51,173 --> 01:30:53,050
No. Thanks, no.

1664
01:30:53,213 --> 01:30:54,407
Jack is emceeing tomorrow.

1665
01:30:54,813 --> 01:30:57,885
- He's in charge of the whole thing.
- So, Jerry, your mother tells me...

1666
01:30:58,053 --> 01:31:00,692
...you're gonna do one of your
little comedy skits tomorrow.

1667
01:31:00,853 --> 01:31:03,287
- I don't think so.
- No?

1668
01:31:03,453 --> 01:31:05,842
Listen, Morty, you want to
settle up for last night?

1669
01:31:06,013 --> 01:31:10,962
All right. I owe you $19.45.

1670
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:13,203
What did you have?
You had the minute steak.

1671
01:31:13,373 --> 01:31:14,965
- Yeah.
- Did you have a Coke or what?

1672
01:31:15,133 --> 01:31:17,522
I did not have a Coke.

1673
01:31:17,693 --> 01:31:18,887
Somebody had a Coke.

1674
01:31:19,133 --> 01:31:20,964
- I had a Coke.
- Oh, and I had the scampi.

1675
01:31:21,533 --> 01:31:25,003
So, that's $17.10,
and the tax and the tip.

1676
01:31:25,373 --> 01:31:27,364
All right, make it 20 bucks.

1677
01:31:27,533 --> 01:31:30,809
It's $19.45, Morty.

1678
01:31:30,973 --> 01:31:32,531
$19.45?

1679
01:31:32,893 --> 01:31:34,326
See, you know your father.

1680
01:31:34,493 --> 01:31:36,529
You got to get it right
to the penny.

1681
01:31:36,693 --> 01:31:39,127
But that's why he was
such a good president.

1682
01:31:39,573 --> 01:31:40,847
Hey, what kind of pen is that?

1683
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,607
- This pen?
- Yeah.

1684
01:31:43,773 --> 01:31:46,241
Oh, this is an astronaut pen.

1685
01:31:46,493 --> 01:31:49,451
It writes upside down.
They use this in space.

1686
01:31:49,613 --> 01:31:53,447
Oh, that's the astronaut pen. I heard
about that. Where did you get it?

1687
01:31:53,933 --> 01:31:56,891
- It was a gift.
- Because a lot of times I write in bed...

1688
01:31:57,053 --> 01:32:00,045
...and I have to turn and lean on
my elbow to make the pen work.

1689
01:32:02,133 --> 01:32:03,532
- Take the pen.
- Oh, no.

1690
01:32:03,693 --> 01:32:04,728
- Go ahead.
- I couldn't.

1691
01:32:04,893 --> 01:32:06,042
- Take it.
- I can't take it.

1692
01:32:06,213 --> 01:32:08,329
- Do me a personal favour.
- No, I'm not comfortable.

1693
01:32:08,493 --> 01:32:10,290
- I cannot take it.
- Take the pen.

1694
01:32:10,453 --> 01:32:13,490
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive. Take the pen.

1695
01:32:14,013 --> 01:32:17,801
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you. Gee, boy.

1696
01:32:17,973 --> 01:32:20,043
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Stop it.

1697
01:32:20,213 --> 01:32:21,851
Jack, we should go.

1698
01:32:23,853 --> 01:32:25,969
It was nice meeting you.

1699
01:32:26,133 --> 01:32:27,532
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks again.

1700
01:32:27,813 --> 01:32:29,212
Come on!

1701
01:32:29,373 --> 01:32:31,250
She's adorable.

1702
01:32:35,373 --> 01:32:36,692
What did you take his pen for?

1703
01:32:38,453 --> 01:32:40,728
- He gave it to me.
- But you didn't have to take it.

1704
01:32:40,893 --> 01:32:43,009
She's gotta make a big deal
out of everything.

1705
01:32:43,173 --> 01:32:45,926
- He offered it to me.
- Because you made such a big fuss.

1706
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:48,482
Well, I liked it. Should I
have said I didn't like it?

1707
01:32:48,653 --> 01:32:51,247
You shouldn't have said anything.
What did you expect?

1708
01:32:51,413 --> 01:32:54,166
He could have said, "Thank you,"
and put it back in his pocket.

1709
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:57,006
- He loves that pen.
- Come on.

1710
01:32:57,173 --> 01:32:59,926
He talks about it all the time.
He goes on and on...

1711
01:33:00,093 --> 01:33:02,607
...about how it writes upside down,
how astronauts use it.

1712
01:33:02,773 --> 01:33:04,411
He never should have offered it.

1713
01:33:04,573 --> 01:33:07,371
- He didn't think you'd accept.
- Well, he was wrong.

1714
01:33:08,493 --> 01:33:11,132
I know his wife.
She has some mouth on her.

1715
01:33:11,293 --> 01:33:14,569
She'll tell everyone in the condo now
that you made him give you the pen.

1716
01:33:14,973 --> 01:33:16,804
They're talking about it right now.

1717
01:33:17,053 --> 01:33:19,362
- So you want me to return it?
- Yes.

1718
01:33:19,533 --> 01:33:21,763
He's not gonna return that pen.
That's ridiculous.

1719
01:33:21,933 --> 01:33:23,525
I don't even want the pen now.

1720
01:33:23,693 --> 01:33:26,491
Jack can afford to give away a pen
with all his money, believe me.

1721
01:33:26,653 --> 01:33:29,167
He gives me a check for $19.45.

1722
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:31,893
He didn't have a Coke.

1723
01:33:33,573 --> 01:33:35,450
Here, let me see it.

1724
01:33:37,613 --> 01:33:40,685
- Hey, it writes upside down.
- Yeah.

1725
01:33:51,053 --> 01:33:52,930
Come in.

1726
01:33:54,693 --> 01:33:56,092
You okay in here?

1727
01:33:57,333 --> 01:34:00,166
Why is it so hot in here?

1728
01:34:01,373 --> 01:34:03,045
How can they sleep like this?

1729
01:34:03,213 --> 01:34:04,771
It's only for three days.

1730
01:34:04,933 --> 01:34:06,605
Today's over.
Then we have tomorrow.

1731
01:34:06,773 --> 01:34:09,685
We leave on Sunday.
It's one day, really.

1732
01:34:12,453 --> 01:34:14,967
What is with this bar?

1733
01:34:15,653 --> 01:34:17,928
It's right in my back. It's killing me.

1734
01:34:18,093 --> 01:34:20,004
You wanna switch?
I'm on a love seat.

1735
01:34:20,173 --> 01:34:23,483
I got my feet up in the air
like I'm in a space capsule.

1736
01:34:24,253 --> 01:34:25,811
I am never gonna fall asleep.

1737
01:34:25,973 --> 01:34:28,362
Oh, no, don't say that.
You'll jinx me.

1738
01:34:30,013 --> 01:34:32,243
How can they not put
the air conditioning on?

1739
01:34:32,413 --> 01:34:34,563
They're nuts with temperature.

1740
01:34:36,973 --> 01:34:39,771
This bar is right in my back.

1741
01:34:42,013 --> 01:34:44,129
It's making a dent.

1742
01:34:46,253 --> 01:34:50,804
How about that guy
writing a check for $19.45?

1743
01:34:51,613 --> 01:34:53,046
I'm sweating here.

1744
01:34:53,933 --> 01:34:56,891
I'm in bed, sweating.

1745
01:34:57,213 --> 01:34:58,805
It's one day.

1746
01:34:59,133 --> 01:35:00,885
Half a day, really.

1747
01:35:01,213 --> 01:35:05,365
I mean, you subtract showers
and meals, it's like 20 minutes.

1748
01:35:05,653 --> 01:35:07,609
It'll go by like that.

1749
01:35:08,893 --> 01:35:12,090
Stay on 95 South
to Biscayne Boulevard.

1750
01:35:13,493 --> 01:35:14,642
Then you make a left turn.

1751
01:35:15,213 --> 01:35:18,285
Put your blinker on immediately,
there's an abutment there.

1752
01:35:18,453 --> 01:35:21,525
Then you're gonna merge over
very quickly, but stay on Biscayne.

1753
01:35:21,693 --> 01:35:23,445
Don't get off Biscayne,
you understand me?

1754
01:35:23,613 --> 01:35:25,490
Stay on Biscayne.

1755
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:27,766
You're going underwater?

1756
01:35:27,933 --> 01:35:30,766
Yes, generally, that's where
scuba diving is done.

1757
01:35:31,053 --> 01:35:33,851
What do you have to go for?
What's down there that's so special?

1758
01:35:34,973 --> 01:35:36,691
What's so special up here?

1759
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:40,527
What's the matter?

1760
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:43,082
- My back.
- What happened?

1761
01:35:43,253 --> 01:35:44,652
That... That bed.

1762
01:35:44,813 --> 01:35:47,122
The bar was right in my back.

1763
01:35:47,293 --> 01:35:49,249
I told you to let us sleep in there.

1764
01:35:49,413 --> 01:35:51,085
Then you would be hunched over.

1765
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:54,561
I don't even know if
I can go scuba diving.

1766
01:35:54,733 --> 01:35:56,963
- You can't go?
- So stay home.

1767
01:35:57,493 --> 01:35:59,245
- You can go.
- Without you?

1768
01:35:59,413 --> 01:36:00,812
That's the reason you came down.

1769
01:36:00,973 --> 01:36:02,770
- Don't go.
- You sure?

1770
01:36:02,933 --> 01:36:04,207
Maybe you should see a doctor.

1771
01:36:04,453 --> 01:36:06,967
- We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
- No, we'll stay in there.

1772
01:36:07,133 --> 01:36:08,407
Why don't you get a new sofa?

1773
01:36:08,893 --> 01:36:10,724
Nobody uses it.

1774
01:36:11,093 --> 01:36:12,731
I'm buying you a new sofa.

1775
01:36:12,893 --> 01:36:14,212
Jerry, don't talk crazy.

1776
01:36:14,373 --> 01:36:16,250
Mrs. Seinfeld, please...

1777
01:36:16,493 --> 01:36:18,449
...I am begging you:

1778
01:36:18,613 --> 01:36:22,526
Put the air conditioner on.

1779
01:36:25,853 --> 01:36:27,445
You're hot?

1780
01:36:28,733 --> 01:36:31,293
I've lost six pounds.

1781
01:36:31,733 --> 01:36:33,325
I don't even know how to work it.

1782
01:36:33,493 --> 01:36:35,882
I keep telling her
it's like an oven in here.

1783
01:36:37,533 --> 01:36:38,807
Is everybody up?

1784
01:36:38,973 --> 01:36:40,645
Hi, how are you?

1785
01:36:40,813 --> 01:36:42,246
Hello, Jerry.

1786
01:36:42,413 --> 01:36:43,892
Evelyn, this is Elaine.

1787
01:36:44,133 --> 01:36:45,327
Hi, Evelyn.

1788
01:36:46,813 --> 01:36:48,929
Jerry, you got thin.

1789
01:36:49,133 --> 01:36:50,646
- Too thin?
- Oh, stop worrying...

1790
01:36:50,813 --> 01:36:52,246
...so much about how you look.

1791
01:36:54,293 --> 01:36:56,045
So where's the new pen?

1792
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:07,210
- What?
- The pen.

1793
01:37:07,373 --> 01:37:09,329
The one Jack Klompus gave you.

1794
01:37:09,693 --> 01:37:12,048
- How did you know that?
- Blanche told me.

1795
01:37:12,213 --> 01:37:15,728
- Blanche?
- That's some good pen.

1796
01:37:15,893 --> 01:37:19,010
- Writes upside down.
- Yeah.

1797
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:22,805
- The astronauts use them.
- What did Blanche say?

1798
01:37:22,973 --> 01:37:25,328
I don't know, she said
Jerry wanted the pen.

1799
01:37:25,493 --> 01:37:27,563
I never really wanted the pen.

1800
01:37:27,733 --> 01:37:29,530
- He gave him the pen.
- Morty.

1801
01:37:29,693 --> 01:37:32,253
- Why? You don't like the pen?
- No, no, l...

1802
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:34,324
Because if you don't,
give it back to him.

1803
01:37:34,493 --> 01:37:36,370
- Is that what she said?
- Who?

1804
01:37:36,533 --> 01:37:38,649
- Blanche.
- What are you talking about?

1805
01:37:41,733 --> 01:37:42,927
Hello?

1806
01:37:43,093 --> 01:37:45,846
Oh, hello, Gussy. What?

1807
01:37:46,013 --> 01:37:49,210
Jerry wouldn't do that.
Jack gave it to him.

1808
01:37:50,653 --> 01:37:53,372
All he said was he liked it.

1809
01:37:53,533 --> 01:37:55,489
I mean, nobody put
a gun to his head.

1810
01:37:55,653 --> 01:37:58,167
You're giving him back that pen.

1811
01:38:00,133 --> 01:38:01,566
Somebody, please.

1812
01:38:01,733 --> 01:38:03,371
The air conditioner.

1813
01:38:03,693 --> 01:38:05,331
Oh, my God, I forgot all about it.

1814
01:38:05,493 --> 01:38:09,122
All I said was, "I like the pen."

1815
01:38:09,933 --> 01:38:12,242
How the hell do you
work this thing?

1816
01:38:15,733 --> 01:38:18,008
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

1817
01:38:18,173 --> 01:38:20,129
Oh, no, no, I wanna go.

1818
01:38:20,293 --> 01:38:21,692
But your back hurts.

1819
01:38:21,853 --> 01:38:24,048
Maybe a couple of muscle
relaxers would help.

1820
01:38:24,413 --> 01:38:25,971
Oh, okay.

1821
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:30,483
You can turn down the air
conditioning if you want.

1822
01:38:30,653 --> 01:38:32,371
No, I'm fine.

1823
01:38:32,813 --> 01:38:35,452
- You're not too cold?
- No.

1824
01:38:36,933 --> 01:38:39,606
- Don't be alarmed.
- Oh, my God.

1825
01:38:39,773 --> 01:38:41,650
- What the hell happened to you?
- I'm okay.

1826
01:38:41,813 --> 01:38:44,373
- My capillaries burst.
- Your capillaries?

1827
01:38:44,533 --> 01:38:47,047
- Do you know what you look like?
- How you doing?

1828
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:48,885
Having a good time.

1829
01:38:49,053 --> 01:38:51,442
Is it my imagination
or is it freezing in here?

1830
01:38:51,613 --> 01:38:53,046
What happened to your eyes?

1831
01:38:53,213 --> 01:38:55,773
- Well, I started to go under...
- With the instructor?

1832
01:38:55,933 --> 01:38:57,366
Yeah, I got about 10 feet down...

1833
01:38:57,533 --> 01:39:00,206
...and felt this tremendous
pressure on my mask...

1834
01:39:00,373 --> 01:39:03,206
...like my eyeballs were being
sucked out of their sockets.

1835
01:39:03,373 --> 01:39:04,601
I told you.

1836
01:39:04,893 --> 01:39:06,326
Excuse me.

1837
01:39:06,493 --> 01:39:09,291
Doris would like to borrow
your red pocketbook...

1838
01:39:09,453 --> 01:39:11,011
...to go with her shoes.

1839
01:39:11,173 --> 01:39:12,970
The shoes have to match
the pocketbook.

1840
01:39:13,893 --> 01:39:15,770
What's she doing, yoga?

1841
01:39:16,453 --> 01:39:18,330
- My back hurts.
- Morty, better hurry up.

1842
01:39:18,493 --> 01:39:20,404
- Get ready.
- We got plenty of time.

1843
01:39:20,573 --> 01:39:22,643
- What happened?
- I got in a fistfight...

1844
01:39:22,813 --> 01:39:25,088
...with one of the ladies at the pool.

1845
01:39:25,573 --> 01:39:26,972
It's from scuba diving.

1846
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:28,732
What's there to see underwater?

1847
01:39:29,053 --> 01:39:30,930
Listen, Mr. Klompus...

1848
01:39:31,093 --> 01:39:34,972
...it was a nice gesture to give me
the pen, but I don't really need it.

1849
01:39:36,133 --> 01:39:37,851
- You what?
- It's a terrific pen...

1850
01:39:38,013 --> 01:39:39,571
...but I think you should keep it.

1851
01:39:40,173 --> 01:39:41,845
- Well, I mean...
- Take it.

1852
01:39:42,493 --> 01:39:44,051
All right.

1853
01:39:44,213 --> 01:39:47,569
You know, Jack, you got a hell
of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

1854
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:49,206
- Whose pen?
- His pen.

1855
01:39:49,373 --> 01:39:50,567
This happens to be my pen.

1856
01:39:50,733 --> 01:39:53,327
- You didn't give it to him?
- What are you talking about?

1857
01:39:53,493 --> 01:39:55,051
He practically begged me for it.

1858
01:39:55,733 --> 01:39:57,246
Where do you come off
with this crap?

1859
01:39:57,413 --> 01:40:00,325
Listen, do you think I take
everything everybody offers me?

1860
01:40:00,653 --> 01:40:02,405
You offered me
sponge cake yesterday.

1861
01:40:02,573 --> 01:40:04,370
- Did I take it?
- You didn't want it.

1862
01:40:04,533 --> 01:40:07,605
Of course I wanted it!
I love sponge cake.

1863
01:40:07,773 --> 01:40:09,411
Who said you couldn't have it?
I mean...

1864
01:40:09,573 --> 01:40:11,928
...what the hell do I care whether
you have sponge cake?

1865
01:40:12,093 --> 01:40:14,163
Because I saw the look
on your face last week...

1866
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:16,051
...when I took the Scotch tape.

1867
01:40:16,493 --> 01:40:18,165
So you got the Scotch tape.

1868
01:40:18,333 --> 01:40:20,642
- I've been looking all over for it.
- I'll give it back.

1869
01:40:20,813 --> 01:40:22,724
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it!

1870
01:40:23,733 --> 01:40:25,803
You know, Jack,
do me a favour, will you?

1871
01:40:25,973 --> 01:40:29,170
Take the pen and the Scotch tape
and get the hell out of here.

1872
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:30,971
Listen, do you think I give a damn?

1873
01:40:34,973 --> 01:40:37,646
Nerve of that guy,
taking back that pen.

1874
01:40:37,813 --> 01:40:39,292
Well, that's it for them.

1875
01:40:39,453 --> 01:40:42,889
What is going on
in this community?

1876
01:40:43,293 --> 01:40:45,045
Are you people aware
of what's happening?

1877
01:40:45,213 --> 01:40:47,568
What is driving you
to this behaviour?

1878
01:40:47,733 --> 01:40:49,849
Is it the humidity? Is it the Muzak?

1879
01:40:50,013 --> 01:40:51,844
Is it the white shoes?

1880
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:55,849
I have no use for either one of them.
I don't want them there tonight.

1881
01:40:56,013 --> 01:40:57,332
Isn't he supposed to emcee?

1882
01:40:57,693 --> 01:40:59,411
Yeah, he's supposed
to be the emcee.

1883
01:41:00,093 --> 01:41:02,129
Well, this should be
a very interesting evening.

1884
01:41:03,693 --> 01:41:06,969
What about those muscle relaxers?

1885
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:12,889
Say "astronaut."

1886
01:41:13,653 --> 01:41:15,450
Say what?

1887
01:41:15,973 --> 01:41:18,009
Say what?

1888
01:41:18,173 --> 01:41:20,448
You took too many of those pills.

1889
01:41:20,893 --> 01:41:22,645
- Astronaut?
- Say it.

1890
01:41:22,813 --> 01:41:26,010
- Astronaut!
- Astro...

1891
01:41:29,653 --> 01:41:30,802
Good. Okay.

1892
01:41:30,973 --> 01:41:33,203
Last year, I took him
to the hospital every day.

1893
01:41:33,373 --> 01:41:35,284
Did he ever say thank you?

1894
01:41:35,453 --> 01:41:36,966
Oh, God.

1895
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:38,805
Uncle Leo.

1896
01:41:39,893 --> 01:41:41,121
Hello!

1897
01:41:42,773 --> 01:41:45,685
- Morty, are you nervous?
- What nervous?

1898
01:41:45,853 --> 01:41:48,367
What's with the sunglasses?
Who are you, Van Johnson?

1899
01:41:48,533 --> 01:41:49,682
I got a black eye.

1900
01:41:50,453 --> 01:41:52,171
Hello.

1901
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:54,803
Oh, Elaine...

1902
01:41:55,453 --> 01:41:56,886
...this is my Aunt Stella.

1903
01:41:57,853 --> 01:41:59,889
Stella!

1904
01:42:02,573 --> 01:42:04,564
Stella!

1905
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:07,723
Her back hurts.

1906
01:42:10,253 --> 01:42:12,369
We saw you on
The Tonight Show last week.

1907
01:42:12,533 --> 01:42:15,093
I thought Johnny
was very rude to you.

1908
01:42:15,253 --> 01:42:18,245
- He didn't even let you talk.
- No, no.

1909
01:42:18,413 --> 01:42:19,732
You need some new material.

1910
01:42:19,893 --> 01:42:23,203
I've heard you do that
dog routine three times already.

1911
01:42:23,853 --> 01:42:26,413
Stella!

1912
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:28,570
Stella!

1913
01:42:29,973 --> 01:42:33,522
You should get your cousin Jeffrey
to write some material for you.

1914
01:42:33,693 --> 01:42:36,253
What? Jeffrey works for
the Parks Department.

1915
01:42:36,413 --> 01:42:38,722
You should read
the letters he's written.

1916
01:42:38,893 --> 01:42:41,202
He's funnier than
the whole bunch of you.

1917
01:42:41,493 --> 01:42:44,087
Oh, here's Jack.
We should sit down.

1918
01:42:46,893 --> 01:42:50,203
This better be good.
I'm missing Golden Girls for this.

1919
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:54,527
I hate her like poison.

1920
01:42:57,373 --> 01:42:59,489
Hey, Jack, let's get started.

1921
01:43:05,173 --> 01:43:07,767
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you know...

1922
01:43:08,133 --> 01:43:12,888
...every year, phase two
of the Pines of Mar Gables...

1923
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:15,772
...honours the previous
year's president.

1924
01:43:15,933 --> 01:43:17,730
And this year, we are honouring...

1925
01:43:17,893 --> 01:43:19,292
...Morty Seinfeld.

1926
01:43:19,453 --> 01:43:21,171
Morty!

1927
01:43:22,893 --> 01:43:27,444
A man who slept more hours
on the job than Ronald Reagan.

1928
01:43:30,173 --> 01:43:32,004
Slept on the job?

1929
01:43:32,173 --> 01:43:34,926
Being president of the condo
is not easy.

1930
01:43:35,093 --> 01:43:38,210
It requires hard work, dedication,
and commitment.

1931
01:43:38,373 --> 01:43:43,242
And unfortunately, he possesses
none of these qualities.

1932
01:43:45,853 --> 01:43:47,605
I wonder what he ever did.

1933
01:43:47,773 --> 01:43:49,684
He's joking.

1934
01:43:49,853 --> 01:43:53,004
His administration did
excel in one department:

1935
01:43:53,173 --> 01:43:55,607
The hiring of incompetents.

1936
01:43:55,933 --> 01:43:57,730
That's what you say.

1937
01:43:57,893 --> 01:44:00,851
But we do owe him
a debt of gratitude...

1938
01:44:01,013 --> 01:44:04,562
...because by not fixing
the crack in the sidewalk...

1939
01:44:04,733 --> 01:44:09,090
...it put Mrs. Ziven out of
commission for a few weeks.

1940
01:44:10,213 --> 01:44:12,329
Tell them about when you
took my son's pen back.

1941
01:44:12,493 --> 01:44:14,131
Tell them about that.

1942
01:44:14,333 --> 01:44:15,607
Dad.

1943
01:44:15,773 --> 01:44:18,287
He gave my son a pen,
and then he takes it back.

1944
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:20,011
- Tell them that!
- I took it back?

1945
01:44:20,173 --> 01:44:22,323
- He gave it to me!
- That's enough. Sit down.

1946
01:44:22,493 --> 01:44:25,007
- I'm not finished!
- Give me that microphone. Give it!

1947
01:44:25,173 --> 01:44:27,562
- Morty, give me that.
- Give him the pen.

1948
01:44:29,093 --> 01:44:31,288
You broke my dental plate.

1949
01:44:31,773 --> 01:44:33,684
Doris! He broke my dental plate.

1950
01:44:33,853 --> 01:44:36,003
You son of a bitch. I'll sue you.

1951
01:44:36,173 --> 01:44:37,526
Jerry, do your act.

1952
01:44:37,733 --> 01:44:39,530
I can't. Nobody's even listening.

1953
01:44:39,693 --> 01:44:41,206
Well, they're all gonna leave.

1954
01:44:41,653 --> 01:44:44,087
- I got witnesses here.
- Even your wife is on my side.

1955
01:44:44,253 --> 01:44:46,289
How you folks doing tonight?

1956
01:44:46,453 --> 01:44:49,809
Hey, have you ever noticed how they
give you the peanuts on the planes?

1957
01:44:49,973 --> 01:44:52,692
- Not my Harry! He flies first class!
- Who thought the thing...

1958
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:55,048
...everybody wants on a plane
is a peanut?

1959
01:44:55,213 --> 01:44:58,330
- I'd rather have a bottle of Scotch!
- Do the dog routine.

1960
01:44:59,173 --> 01:45:02,245
All I said was, "I like the pen!"

1961
01:45:04,213 --> 01:45:07,922
Stella!

1962
01:45:09,013 --> 01:45:10,332
You could aggravate it.

1963
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:12,969
I wouldn't go anywhere
for at least five days.

1964
01:45:13,453 --> 01:45:15,171
Five days?

1965
01:45:15,333 --> 01:45:17,688
You want me to stay here
for five more days?

1966
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:19,605
There must be some mistake.

1967
01:45:20,013 --> 01:45:21,526
I'm afraid not.

1968
01:45:21,693 --> 01:45:23,763
Five days. Here.

1969
01:45:24,053 --> 01:45:27,090
So we have you for five more days.

1970
01:45:27,773 --> 01:45:30,162
There's no point in me staying.
You're just gonna be...

1971
01:45:30,333 --> 01:45:31,846
Excuse me?

1972
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:33,812
Nothing.

1973
01:45:35,453 --> 01:45:37,808
- Good morning.
- Hi, Evelyn.

1974
01:45:38,053 --> 01:45:41,011
Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?

1975
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:43,483
- I don't think so.
- Because my nephew Larry...

1976
01:45:43,653 --> 01:45:45,689
...could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer.

1977
01:45:45,853 --> 01:45:47,889
He says Jack has no case.

1978
01:45:48,133 --> 01:45:50,010
I'll ask him when he gets up.

1979
01:45:50,173 --> 01:45:52,050
Oh, and I spoke to Arnold...

1980
01:45:52,373 --> 01:45:56,764
...and he says that according to the
bylaws of the condo constitution...

1981
01:45:56,933 --> 01:46:01,165
...they need six votes to throw you out
for unruly behaviour.

1982
01:46:01,853 --> 01:46:03,127
Not five.

1983
01:46:03,413 --> 01:46:06,086
Dr. Chernov is the one
you'll have to suck up to.

1984
01:46:10,293 --> 01:46:11,646
Oh, my back.

1985
01:46:11,813 --> 01:46:13,610
Oh, my back.

1986
01:46:13,773 --> 01:46:16,890
That bar. Who the hell
could sleep on that thing?

1987
01:46:17,213 --> 01:46:19,727
- I was very comfortable.
- Morty...

1988
01:46:19,893 --> 01:46:22,965
...Arnold says they need
six votes to throw you out.

1989
01:46:23,133 --> 01:46:24,532
It's in the constitution.

1990
01:46:24,693 --> 01:46:27,571
- Who are you?
- I'm a chiropractor.

1991
01:46:27,733 --> 01:46:29,963
What, are you kidding me?

1992
01:46:30,933 --> 01:46:32,412
Five more days?

1993
01:46:32,893 --> 01:46:37,603
Well, today's almost over,
and weekdays always go by fast.

1994
01:46:37,773 --> 01:46:40,241
And Friday, we're leaving,
so it's like two days, really.

1995
01:46:41,693 --> 01:46:43,729
It's like a cup of coffee.

1996
01:46:44,093 --> 01:46:46,004
It'll go by like that.

1997
01:46:46,613 --> 01:46:49,923
Is Florida not hot and muggy
enough for these people?

1998
01:46:50,093 --> 01:46:51,572
They love heat.

1999
01:46:51,733 --> 01:46:54,088
If they ever decide to
land men on the sun...

2000
01:46:54,253 --> 01:46:57,006
...I think these old retired guys
will be the only ones...

2001
01:46:57,173 --> 01:46:59,482
...that will be able to handle it.
They'll sit there...

2002
01:46:59,653 --> 01:47:02,963
...on the redwood benches,
washcloth on their head, going:

2003
01:47:03,413 --> 01:47:05,768
"I'm trying to get a sweat going."

2004
01:47:49,093 --> 01:47:51,084
