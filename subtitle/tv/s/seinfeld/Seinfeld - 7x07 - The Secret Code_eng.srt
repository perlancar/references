1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,033
They got us trained
to use the cash machine.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,394
We're chickens in an experiment...

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,630
...waiting for that pellet
to come down the shoot.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,071
You see people at the cash machine.
They're just there.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,314
Waiting for the sound.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,392
You're waiting for the sound.
That's what we're trained to hear.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,199
The here-comes-the-money sound,
you know?

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,869
It's exciting. Don't you get excited?

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,550
"It's coming. It's coming.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,950
They're giving me money."

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,440
Hey, I gotta get some cash.
I'm gonna run down to the ATM.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,790
- Yeah, I gotta grab some too.
- I'll get it for you.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,712
Just give me your card.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,390
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, just tell me your code.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,233
My code?

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,792
- So why didn't you tell her the code?
- No way.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,111
George, you're gonna
marry this woman, most likely.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,436
It says very clearly,
"For your protection...

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,319
...do not give your secret code
to anyone."

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,478
So you're taking relationship advice
from Chemical Bank now?

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,760
Why does everything have to be "us"?
Is there no "me" left?

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,276
Why can't there be some things
just for me? Is that so selfish?

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,710
Actually, that's the definition
of selfish.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,433
Have you given your code
to anyone?

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,791
No one's ever asked. Do you want it?
It's Jor-EI.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,514
- Superman's father on Krypton.
- Of course.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,990
Come on, Georgie,
you know you wanna tell me.

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,391
It's eating you up inside.

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,473
Sing it, sister.

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,753
No. No, I am not giving my code
to anyone for any reason.

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,957
What if my life depended on it?

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,958
If you're in some situation where
fast cash will save your life...

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,838
...l'll give you the code.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,035
- What's the matter with your leg?
- My foot fell asleep.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,589
- How did your foot fall asleep?
- I crossed my legs.

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,432
I forgot to alternate.

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,919
- Hey, Jerry, George.
- Hey, Fred.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,718
- Hey, Freddie.
- Foot fell asleep.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,434
You're lucky. At least you got
something to do.

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,119
- Hey, Fred, do you know Elaine?
- No.

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,714
Nice to meet you. Well, I'm out of here.
See you, guys.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,478
- All right, Fred.
- See you.

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,674
Did you hear that?
He said, "Nice to meet you."

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,038
- So?
- So we've met before.

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,192
At Katie Ash's party.
We talked for, like, 10 minutes.

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,152
And he didn't remember you?

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,429
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go talk to him.

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,596
Excuse me. Excuse me, Fred.

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,716
- Yeah.
- Hi.

50
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,037
You just said, "Nice to meet you,"
but actually we've met before.

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,800
- We have?
- Yeah. Yeah, at Katie Ash's party.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,433
What was your name again?

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,433
Elaine. You don't remember
our conversation?

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,636
I talked about how
my uncle worked...

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,519
...in the book depository building
with Lee Harvey Oswald.

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,754
Not ringing a bell.

57
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,798
When my uncle said to him,
"The president's been shot"...

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,872
...Oswald winked at him and said,
"I'm gonna go catch a movie."

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,836
- No.
- Right when we were in front of...

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,389
...the bathroom door.
- The bathroom door.

61
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,030
I remember someone had played
tic-tac-toe on it and the X's won.

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,909
They went diagonally from
the top left to the bottom right.

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,956
Sounds great. I'd love to do
some TV commercials.

64
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,633
That should really be fun.

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,190
Okay. All right, bye.
How do you like that?

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,914
I'm gonna do TV spots
for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store.

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,640
That was Leapin' Larry himself.
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,756
Leapin' Larry.
That's where I bought this.

69
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,474
- What is that?
- It's an emergency-band scanner.

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,269
It picks up everything:
fires, harbour patrol, even the police.

71
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm watching the watchers, Jerry.

72
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,629
We got a big fire on 115th.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,315
I tell you, if I could do it over again,
I'd give it all up to be a fireman.

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,318
Yeah, those civil servants who
risk their lives really got it made.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,756
Yeah. When I was a kid,
all I ever dreamed of...

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,514
...was steering the back
of that big hook-and-ladder.

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,870
You're lucky they let you drive a car.

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,030
No, no, no. They're taking
the West Side Highway.

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,031
At this time of day? That's insane.

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,760
They're heading
straight into gridlock.

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,951
Oh, those fools.

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,395
What was that? All right.

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,199
So get a load of this.

84
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,713
This guy, Fred Yerkes...

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,759
...remembers every little thing
about that night except me.

86
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,309
Really? I'm surprised.
He doesn't meet that many women.

87
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,239
So, what are you saying?

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,433
What's to be said.
He didn't remember you.

89
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,473
Yeah, but why? I mean...

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,593
...you know.

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,034
I know.

92
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,117
- You know?
- Yeah, I know.

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,669
- You got the new catalogue.
- Yeah. Good piece...

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,513
...on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
- Too good. Peterman was so pleased...

95
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,114
...now he wants to take me
out to dinner tomorrow.

96
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,589
- Maybe you wanna come.
- Why would I wanna do that?

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,358
Please, Jerry.
Please, please, please.

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,590
I can't sit with him.
He tells these stories.

99
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,955
It's gonna be awful.

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,394
Yeah, sounds like fun.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,672
I want you to tell me, George.

102
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,478
Why? Why is my code
so important?

103
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,437
Because it's part of our relationship.

104
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,272
It's an indication of trust.

105
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,670
We're not supposed to
keep secrets from one another.

106
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,916
I'm sure you have secrets from me.

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,640
I don't know anything
about your cycles.

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,478
- My cycles?
- I never know what's going on there.

109
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,230
Well, from now on,
I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.

110
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,476
- Please.
- Anything else?

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,392
We're out of Bosco.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,309
How about this?
"Come on down to Leapin' Larry's.

113
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,636
If you beat our prices,
we'll give you the store."

114
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,072
You know, I've always liked
your comedy.

115
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,073
- You don't take cheap shots.
- No, I don't.

116
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,955
I'm sorry for keeping you so long.
Again, I apologize for the mess.

117
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,555
This renovation is killing me.

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,358
My foot's asleep again.

119
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,313
When I lost my leg
in the boating accident last year...

120
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,910
...I got so depressed
about this damn prosthetic...

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,640
...I thought I was gonna have to
give up the business.

122
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,997
But now, I'm rejuvenated.

123
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,515
Let me show you around the store.

124
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,240
You know what,
I'll be with you in a minute.

125
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,835
That is a great impression.

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,591
Larry, wait, you don't understand.

127
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,029
I just came from Leapin' Larry's.
What, making fun of crippled people?

128
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,599
Is that what you've sunk to?

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,473
No, I didn't do it on purpose.
My foot fell asleep.

130
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,079
Oh, your foot fell asleep.

131
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,319
You know, the guy has one leg and
he still calls himself Leapin' Larry.

132
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,152
You'd think he'd have
a sense of humour.

133
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,830
You just joked yourself out of that
commercial, didn't you, munjamba?

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,398
Yeah.

135
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,393
Oh, boy. Look at that.

136
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,755
See, that's that fire
I was listening to yesterday.

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,793
The whole building burned down.

138
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,791
They just don't know
what street to take.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,912
Remember I got us to Yankee Stadium
in rush hour in 15 minutes?

140
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,150
- Of course.
- It's all up here, Jerry.

141
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,880
All up here. It's innate.

142
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,469
The amazing thing is
you never have any place to go.

143
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,154
Where are we gonna eat?

144
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,550
We're gonna meet Elaine and
Peterman at the Chinese place.

145
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,751
Nobody mentioned
anything about Peterman.

146
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,598
If I did, would you have gone?

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,074
- No way.
- There you go.

148
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,554
I don't even know Peterman.

149
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,280
Now how am I gonna relax?
I'm gonna have to be on all night.

150
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,749
I don't like being on, Jerry.
I'd much rather be off.

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,712
Trust me, you're off.

152
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,874
Oh, hi, Fred.

153
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,513
Hello.

154
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,473
- It's Elaine.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

155
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,194
- Yeah. How you doing?
- I'm depressed.

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,510
I got this new shirt.
The button fell off.

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,399
Once the button falls off, that's it.
I'll never fix it.

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,878
- Yeah, that's too bad.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins.

159
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,349
- I feel depleted.
- I never take them.

160
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,351
They make you nauseous, right?

161
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,597
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
You remembered.

162
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,711
Do you wanna have dinner tonight?

163
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,435
- Tonight?
- What, you have other plans?

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,912
No, no, no. None that I can...

165
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,991
...remember.

166
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,798
All right. You're locked up in a prison
in Turkey. I have your wallet.

167
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,235
The only way I can bribe the guards
to get you out...

168
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,998
...is for you to give me
your ATM code.

169
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,798
- Call the embassy.
- They're closed.

170
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,156
- Why?
- Bomb threat.

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,351
- We're in Turkey?
- Midnight Express, my friend.

172
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,189
My card won't work.
They're not on the PLUS system.

173
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,909
You must be Jerry Seinfeld.

174
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,951
Yes. Hi, Mr. Peterman.

175
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,037
This is George Costanza.

176
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,519
J. Peterman.

177
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,238
J. Crew.

178
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,918
So is Elaine here?

179
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,071
Oh, Elaine just called.
She won't be joining us.

180
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,831
But not to worry. I'll tell the maître d'
it'll just be the three bulls.

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,236
What? He still wants to have dinner
with us?

182
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,829
- Without Elaine? What for?
- What is he, crazy?

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,193
Oh, we gotta get out of here.

184
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,998
Come on, weave your web,
liar-man.

185
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,476
- I got nothing. l... I'm blank.
- Come on, George...

186
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,632
...what's the matter with you?
- I'm choking.

187
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,112
Oh, Fong has been
most accommodating.

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,589
- Shall we?
- Actually, I just remembered...

189
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,274
...I promised this comedy club
that I'd do a set tonight.

190
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,273
- I'm terribly sorry.
- I understand. No hard feelings.

191
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,951
George and I
will miss your company.

192
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,714
Fong, it will just
be two this evening.

193
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,552
Well, George...

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,390
...we dine.

195
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,952
I can't believe this.
This guy's standing me up?

196
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,960
And there, tucked into the river's bend,
was the object of my search...

197
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,674
...the Guangia River Market.

198
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,719
Fabrics and spices
traded under a starlit sky.

199
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,717
It was there that I discovered
the Pamplona Beret.

200
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,273
Sizes seven and a half through
eight and three quarters. Price, $35.

201
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,837
What about sports?
You follow sports?

202
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,191
It's fourth and inches and
the Giants are going for it.

203
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,590
You've gotta love sports.

204
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,876
You know, this is very nice,
but I really could take a cab, really...

205
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,996
Nonsense, George.

206
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,078
Besides, it gives me a chance to
tell you about my trip to Burma.

207
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,518
I discovered a very unusual
corduroy.

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,793
Peterman here.

209
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,360
What? Oh, no.

210
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,837
All right. I'll be right there.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,514
It's my mother.
She's at death's door.

212
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,153
- What?
- I just pray to God...

213
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,157
...we can make it there in time.

214
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,790
I can't believe you blew us off.
We did you a fav our.

215
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,712
Well, Fred asked me out.

216
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,755
- Fred?
- Yeah, and then he stood me up.

217
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,399
I don't get this guy.

218
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,953
You see what's going on here.

219
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,395
You're attracted to him because
he can't remember you.

220
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,710
I am? But that's so sick.

221
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,353
That's God's plan.

222
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,954
He doesn't really want anyone
to get together.

223
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,959
Anyway, so how was the dinner?

224
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,238
Well, when I heard
you weren't coming...

225
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,550
...I made an excuse and
got the hell out of there.

226
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,114
What about Georgie?

227
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,229
He didn't make it.

228
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,835
- Doctor, how is she?
- She's too weak to talk.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,516
- She'll be happy to hear you.
- Mama, it's me, Jacobo.

230
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,836
I'm here for you, Mama.

231
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,076
I'm George Costanza.

232
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,755
I was having dinner with your son.

233
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,271
Shake off the dew, my friend.

234
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,919
Oh, man.

235
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,071
- What time is it?
- It's morning.

236
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,390
Thanks for seeing me
through the night.

237
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,437
I'll make us a pot of coffee, George.

238
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,874
Watch her, won't you?

239
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,031
- Who?
- Mama.

240
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,798
Just talk to her, George.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,434
The doctor seems to think it helps.

242
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,435
Hi. You know, l... l...

243
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,838
I really should be getting back
to my fiancée. You know, we...

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,798
We had this big fight yesterday...

245
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,034
...and, well, she wants to know
my secret code.

246
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,558
I don't know. I can't tell her.

247
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,868
The funny thing is, you know,
I would really love to tell someone...

248
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,600
...because it's killing me.

249
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,915
You wanna know what it is?

250
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,237
It's Bosco.

251
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,152
You know, the chocolate syrup.

252
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,154
I love that stuff. I pour it in milk.
It's my favourite drink.

253
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,312
Boy, that is a relief.

254
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,754
Bosco.

255
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,197
Bosco.

256
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,479
- Bosco.
- Mama?

257
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,638
- Quiet, quiet. It's a secret.
- Bosco! Bosco!

258
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,191
- Shut up. It's a secret.
- Mama, what are you trying to say?

259
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,516
Bosco.

260
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,397
She's gone.

261
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,510
Bosco?

262
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,518
This never would have happened...

263
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,717
...if you hadn't bailed out on me.
- I did not bail out on you.

264
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,757
Why couldn't you include me
in your excuse?

265
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,678
Why didn't you
come up with your own?

266
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,512
I froze.

267
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,398
- I think I'm losing it.
- Oh, come on.

268
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,835
- Maybe you're just in a slump.
- No, no.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,992
I reached down
and there was nothing there.

270
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,996
Now Peterman wants me
to go to the funeral.

271
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,714
Oh, come on, just tell me
your code already. What is it?

272
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,509
I am not giving you my code.

273
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,158
- I bet I can guess it.
- Yeah, right.

274
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,274
Oh, all right. Yeah.

275
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,749
Let's see.

276
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,549
Well, we can throw out birthdays
immediately. That's too obvious.

277
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,955
And no numbers for you.
You're a word man.

278
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,878
All right. Let's go deeper.

279
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,596
What kind of man are you?

280
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,035
Well, you're weak, spineless.

281
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,830
A man of temptations.

282
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,594
But what tempts you?

283
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,190
You're a portly fellow...

284
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,590
...a little long in the waistband.

285
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,111
So, what's your pleasure?

286
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,640
Is it the salty snacks you crave?

287
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,756
No, no, no.

288
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,354
Yours is a sweet tooth.

289
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,109
- Get out of here.
- Oh, you may stray...

290
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,397
...but you'll always return
to your dark master...

291
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,676
...the cocoa bean.

292
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,638
- I'm leaving.
- And only the purest syrup nectar...

293
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,153
...can satisfy you.
- I gotta go.

294
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,390
If you could,
you'd guzzle it by the gallon.

295
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,599
- Ovaltine, Hershey's, Nestlé's Quik.
- Shut up! Shut up!

296
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,757
- What was that?
- What?

297
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,514
You just checked your watch.
Are you thinking of bailing?

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,070
I got a date.

299
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,073
- Oh, Mr. Peterman.
- Oh, Elaine.

300
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,719
George.

301
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,559
When Mama said "Bosco"...

302
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,631
...she must have been
communicating something.

303
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,597
Her legacy. A dying wish, perhaps.

304
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,438
Mothers say things.

305
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,149
My mother goes babbling on and on
like a crazy person.

306
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,594
Mr. Peterman...

307
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,320
...you have my deepest sympathies.

308
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,276
Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.

309
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,911
- You do?
- Yes, actually we both do.

310
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,476
I have a personal commitment.

311
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,235
- Well, personal... I mean, we both...
- What is it?

312
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,710
I'm speaking at a
woman's rights conference.

313
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,518
Yes, and I'm speaking
at a men's conference.

314
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,716
I don't believe that for a minute.

315
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,034
- Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
- My pleasure.

316
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,194
Fortunately, I still have George here
to help me through this.

317
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,397
You know, George, growing up
as a boy in Costa Rica...

318
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,711
...I heard a rumour that
Mama had taken a lover.

319
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,156
Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.

320
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,951
You wanna come to
the fire station with me?

321
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,918
- Fire station?
- Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts.

322
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,593
I'm gonna rock their world.

323
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,352
I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.

324
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,556
- He took you back?
- Yeah, we straightened it out.

325
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,039
- All is forgiven.
- You know...

326
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,555
...the important thing is that
you learned something.

327
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,790
No, I didn't.

328
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,318
Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of shortcuts
is most impressive.

329
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,038
This is just
the Upper West Side.

330
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,832
Wait until I get to the Village.

331
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,355
Then you're gonna see a magic show.

332
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,154
Mr. Kramer, almost every week
some hothead like yourself...

333
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,113
...saunters in here
talking about faster routes...

334
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,311
...and snazzier colours for the truck.
- Well, l...

335
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,473
The fact is, we feel things are
fine the way they are.

336
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,838
Thanks for having me back and
sorry about the misunderstanding.

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,797
Water under the bridge.

338
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,032
Come on. I never did get a chance to
show you around the store.

339
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,639
Oh, sure.

340
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,631
Oh, again.

341
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,071
I'll be right there.

342
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,437
Attention, company 390.
Structure fire...

343
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,989
...at Leapin' Larry's
Appliance Warehouse.

344
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,233
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown.
You gotta take Amsterdam.

345
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,949
- Stay out of this, Kramer.
- All right, men, let's move it.

346
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,473
Pull those doors.

347
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,311
Move. Move.

348
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,391
Giddyup.

349
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,556
Are you okay, cowboy?

350
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,069
- Where do you need to go?
- I drive the back of the truck.

351
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,070
You'd better take it easy.

352
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,913
All right, 48, let's go. Let's go!

353
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,111
Sorry about the other night.
My mother called.

354
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,635
She couldn't find her pills.
I had to go into Brooklyn...

355
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,916
...help her find the pills
and they were right in...

356
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,992
...the medicine cabinet.
Could you believe that?

357
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,833
The worst part is getting from
the subway station to the house.

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,319
There's no transportation.

359
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,192
What am I doing?

360
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,990
I'm on a date with this guy
because he didn't remember me?

361
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,673
He's demented. Listen to him.

362
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,116
I could take a cab, but if my mother
saw me in a cab, she would yell at me:

363
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,192
"Freddie, what are you taking
a cab for? It's so expensive."

364
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,754
She's out of her mind.

365
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,434
Eventually, you'll meet her.

366
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,917
Bosco.

367
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,870
Bosco.

368
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,593
Bosco.

369
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,555
There's a big fire down the street.
The whole block is going up in flames.

370
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,759
George.

371
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,271
We're gonna make a left
onto Broadway.

372
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,557
No, I would advise against that.

373
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,676
- Who is this?
- It's Kramer.

374
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,591
Kramer?

375
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,752
What are you doing back there?

376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,912
Desota's down,
but Cosmo's got the caboose.

377
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,158
- How did this start?
- Beats me.

378
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,230
Where the hell is the fire department?
I'm gonna lose the whole store.

379
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,232
Kramer, get the hell out of there.

380
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,311
You're not trained to
operate this equipment.

381
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,198
- Hey, Kramer!
- Hey!

382
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,157
Pay attention, Kramer!

383
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,788
Hey, try the scanner.
See if you can pick up anything.

384
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,990
What are you doing, Kramer?
You're all over the road.

385
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,072
- Don't worry, cap, I can handle it.
- Kramer?

386
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,232
You're losing control.

387
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,392
Hard right! Hard right!

388
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,070
We're never gonna to mak e it!

389
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,958
That's a shame.

390
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,435
This fire's gonna eat up
this entire block.

391
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,514
George, look. There's a man in there.

392
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,079
Get out. You're in danger.

393
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,391
My sleeve, it's stuck in the machine.
It ate my card.

394
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,118
George, give me your ATM card.

395
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,032
I don't have my ATM card.

396
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,475
George, you're obviously lying.
Anyone can see that.

397
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,713
It's jammed.

398
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,314
I'll slide it under the door.

399
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,071
- Now give me your code.
- What? Why?

400
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,037
The machine won't open
without the code.

401
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,798
- George, give him your code.
- But l...

402
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,474
George, there's no time.
Tell him your code.

403
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,153
Shout out your code, man.

404
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,715
Code! The code!

405
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,837
Hi.

406
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,354
- Here's your cash, George.
- Thanks.

407
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,919
And here's your card back.

408
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,790
Anyone for Bosco?

409
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,270
Oh, my God.

410
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,158
- Look at this.
- What?

411
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,436
It's the new J. Peterman catalogue.
Look, look.

412
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,439
"The Rogue's Wallet.

413
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,036
It's where he kept his card,
his dirty little secret.

414
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,192
Short, devious, balding...

415
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,828
...his name was Costanza.

416
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,230
He killed my mother."
