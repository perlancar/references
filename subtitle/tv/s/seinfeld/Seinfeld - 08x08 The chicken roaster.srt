1
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,863
Adollar eighty-nine.
Why is this $1.89?

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,065
Why is there no
haggling in this country?

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,370
We like to think we've progressed
beyond a knife fight for a drink.

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,275
Not me.
Everything should be negotiable.

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,382
-Restaurants too?
-Absolutely.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,542
Are you telling me there is
no room to move on pasta?

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,585
All starches are a scam.

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,251
Yeah, especially ziti,
with that big hole.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,193
Excuse me. How much is this?

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,556
-A dollar nineteen.
-I'll give you a quarter.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,288
Get the hell out of here.

12
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,025
-Tell him 40 and no fork.
-Thirty.

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,533
That's it. You leave
and never come back.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,865
How about we leave
and come back in a week?

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,371
Deal.

16
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,043
All right. See?
We got something there.

17
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,847
Oh, check it out.

18
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,148
Kenny Rogers Roasters
finally opened.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,756
Hey, look at the size of
that neon chicken on the roof.

20
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,619
Rogers can't sell chicken around here.

21
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,556
We got chicken places
on every block.

22
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,923
He is The Gambler.

23
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,424
Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet
store. I'm helping him pick out a turtle.

24
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,501
-Try and stay calm.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,470
-Hey. Jerry?
-Seth.

26
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,802
Wow, what has it been,
like, five years?

27
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,967
-At least.
-You want to grab lunch?

28
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,310
I'm actually
headed back to the office.

29
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,073
Seth, it's me.

30
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,150
What's more important than catching
up with an old college buddy?

31
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,844
Well, I am supposed
to be in this meeting.

32
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:33,755
Blow it off. Remember Poli-Sci?
How many of those did we go to?

33
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,354
-All right, I guess I can go.
-All right. All right.

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,623
-Hey, whatever happened to Moochy?
-He's dead.

35
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,289
Is that right?

36
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,860
Still don't know how you can call lunch
with me a business expense.

37
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,006
-What do you think of the catalog?
-Stinks.

38
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,765
There, we just talked business.

39
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,544
We have the down comforter
and the cookware you liked.

40
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,374
Great. Put it on the Peterman
account with the other stuff.

41
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,209
You know what we have
you might like?

42
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,146
I'll take it.

43
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,685
Hey, you like?

44
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,357
I think it looks very nice on you.

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,854
Really?

46
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,225
Elaine?

47
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,028
-The Peterman account?
-Why not?

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,862
And some hair
for my little friend here.

49
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,467
So how's your standup career?

50
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,335
Good. As a matter of fact,
I almost had my own show in Japan.

51
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,340
-You speak Japanese?
-No.

52
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,708
So you would have done it in
Japan, but in English?

53
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,516
I don't know.

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,919
So, what's this job of yours?

55
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,221
Big investment firm.
We just got the Citibank account.

56
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,520
In fact, today was our
first big meeting with them.

57
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,361
The meeting you blew off?

58
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,397
Yeah.

59
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,963
Wasn't that kind of important?

60
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,334
Yeah.

61
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,279
And I bought a whole new set
of cookware and a water pick.

62
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,971
-You use a water pick?
-Sure. Water pick...

63
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,344
...floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.

64
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,112
So you go into the bathroom 1 1,
you're in bed by what, 2?

65
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:12,224
At the latest. Oh, hang on a second.
I've got another call.

66
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,190
-Hello?
-Good day, Miss Benes...

67
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,794
...it's Roger lpswich.

68
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,090
Oh, hey, how are things
doing in accounting?

69
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,428
Miss Benes, I notice you've been
charging quite a bit of merchandise...

70
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,001
...on the Peterman account.

71
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,468
Well, I am the president.

72
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,507
Yes, and we're all very impressed.

73
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,841
Nevertheless, the expense account
is for business purposes only.

74
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,680
Well-- Well, isn't the president
allowed to do anything that they want?

75
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,410
No.

76
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:46,789
I'll be in your office
first thing tomorrow. Good day.

77
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,985
Good day.

78
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,562
Hello?

79
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,104
Anybody?

80
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,840
Hey.

81
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,847
Hey. Why didn't you
get the big one?

82
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,448
This hat just bottles in the heat.
I don't even need a coat.

83
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,986
It's unbelievable.

84
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,181
-I don't believe it.
-And I got a date with the saleswoman.

85
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,086
She got a little Marisa Tomei
thing going on.

86
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,595
Too bad you've got a little
George Costanza thing going on.

87
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,359
I'm going out with her tomorrow.
She had errands to run.

88
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,001
That's a date?

89
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,637
What's the difference?
You know the way I work.

90
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,534
I'm like a commercial jingle.

91
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,700
First, it's a little irritating. You hear it
a few times. You hum it in the shower.

92
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,211
By the third date, it's "By Mennen. "

93
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,173
How you make sure
you get to the third date?

94
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,343
If there's any doubt,
I do a leave-behind.

95
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,150
Keys, gloves, scarf.
I go back to her place to pick it up...

96
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,021
-...date number two.
-That is so old.

97
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,822
Why don't you just show up
at her house in a wooden horse?

98
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,131
By Mennen

99
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,898
What the--?

100
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,415
What's going on in there?

101
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,553
-What?
-That light.

102
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,484
Oh, the red.

103
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,717
Yeah, it's the chicken roaster sign.
It's right across from my window.

104
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,327
Can't you shut the shades?

105
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,554
They are shut.

106
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,699
By the way, your friend Seth,
he stopped by.

107
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,925
-Yeah? What'd he have to say?
-He was fired.

108
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,106
As you can see, the comforter
I expensed is actually...

109
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,539
...the Aristotle goose down tunic.

110
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,969
-What do you think?
-Another bull's-eye.

111
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,775
Well, Mr. Ipswich,
since every one of my expenses...

112
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,751
...was obviously
for a legitimate business purpose--

113
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,085
I just need to see the
sable hat you purchased yesterday.

114
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,385
The hat? Why do you need to
see the hat?

115
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,552
It cost $8000.

116
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,288
What?

117
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,729
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so
important, why did you go to lunch?

118
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,304
We're old college buddies.

119
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,533
I only knew you through Moochy.

120
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,404
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it,
all right?

121
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,912
The important thing is,
is we got a chance to catch up.

122
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,710
Mind if I grab the want ads?

123
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,916
Actually, I haven't read
Tank McNamara yet.

124
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,127
How's life on the red planet?

125
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,596
It's killing me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

126
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:46,102
All I can see is that giant red sun
in the shape of a chicken.

127
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,140
Well, did you go down to the
Kenny Rogers and complain?

128
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,969
Oh, they gave me the heave-ho.

129
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,507
I don't think that Kenny Rogers has
any idea what's going on down there.

130
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,342
What are you doing?

131
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,645
-Getting some cereal.
-That's tomato juice.

132
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,323
That looked like milk to me.

133
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,794
Jerry, my rods
and cones are all screwed up.

134
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,928
All right, that's it.

135
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,434
I gotta move in with you, Jerry.

136
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,831
I don't know, Kramer.

137
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,040
My concern is that...

138
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,272
...Iiving together after a while we...

139
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,011
...might start to get on
each other's nerves a little.

140
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,253
Listen, I got an idea.
You're a heavy sleeper, right?

141
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,822
Why don't we switch apartments?

142
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,186
Or I could sleep in the park.

143
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,188
You can knock these walls down,
make it an eight-room luxury suite.

144
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:51,064
Jerry, these are loadbearing walls.
They're not gonna come down.

145
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,468
Yeah, that's no good.

146
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,869
I may have to drive that place
out of business.

147
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,170
-Well, how are you going to do that?
-Like we did in the '60s.

148
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,438
Taking it to the streets.

149
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:11,149
-Thanks, George, but I got it from here.
-Oh, no, I'm in already. Come on.

150
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,220
So you wanna
get together tomorrow?

151
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,386
No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.

152
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,992
-What about this weekend?
-I'm gonna be busy for a while.

153
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,998
Okay. See you.

154
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,834
Hey, you forgot your keys.

155
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,772
-Those aren't my keys.
-Well, they're not mine.

156
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,206
They are my keys. How weird.

157
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,419
-Goodbye, George.
-Yeah, bye.

158
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,047
George, bye.

159
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:52,161
Hello? You are not gonna
believe the date I just had.

160
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,126
Costanza

161
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,102
What do you mean,
you don't have the hat?

162
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,138
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?

163
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,367
No, dead.

164
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,209
George, I need
that Russian hat back.

165
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,371
All right, all right. I'll call Heather.

166
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,882
You'll get your hat back.
I will get a second date.

167
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,782
Now, watch the magic.

168
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,816
Dial nine, Merlin.

169
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,431
-Hello?
-Heather, hi, it's George Costanza.

170
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,802
Listen, I don't mean
to bother you, but silly me...

171
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,499
...I-- I think I may have left my hat
in your apartment, so I thought...

172
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,112
-...I'd just come by later and pick it up.
-You didn't leave a hat here.

173
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,410
I'm pretty sure I left it behind the
cushion of the chair, accidentally.

174
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,712
No hat. George, I've gotta go.

175
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,618
You know what,
maybe I'll just come-- Hey, hey.

176
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,489
-Seth?
-Jerry, hi. What do you think?

177
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,430
I think you're taking the trash
out for this chicken place...

178
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,096
-...but that couldn't be.
-Yeah, I'm the new manager.

179
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,004
But you were an executive.
This is fast food.

180
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,702
Not fast food. Good food quickly.

181
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,279
Hey, next time lunch
will be on me, huh, Jer?

182
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,848
Hey!

183
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,151
Stay away from the chicken!
It's bad!

184
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,948
Bad chicken! Mess you up!

185
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,785
That's not going to be
good for business.

186
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,450
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

187
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,167
I'm so glad we switched apartments.
It was the perfect solution.

188
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,535
Kramer, if I'm gonna live over there,
you gotta take some of this stuff out.

189
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,336
I mean, this thing
is really freaking me out.

190
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,038
I feel like it's gonna come to life
in the middle of the night and kill me.

191
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,908
What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.

192
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:56,521
And one other thing, I don't want
Newman using my--

193
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,316
Oh, no.

194
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,554
-Nice place you got here, Kramer.
-Yeah.

195
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,093
A man could really
get some thinking done.

196
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,996
Don't get too comfortable.
As soon as Seth gets a real job...

197
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,262
...you two are going back in that
chicken supernova.

198
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,575
What's that, Rogers chicken?
Oh, get that out of here.

199
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,734
I don't know. The man makes
a pretty strong bird.

200
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,937
Yeah, but I'm boycotting.

201
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,957
-What is that, hickory?
-Yeah.

202
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,628
It's the wood that makes it good.

203
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,924
Really?

204
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,103
Stop it. What's the matter with you?

205
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,709
-Can I help you?
-Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes.

206
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:00,511
We met at Barney's.
I'm a friend of George Costanza's.

207
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,244
Hi.

208
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:06,653
Whether you're aware of it or not,
George had this pathetic little plan...

209
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:11,126
...to leave something behind so he
could try and weasel a second date.

210
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,958
-Really?
-I know.

211
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,259
He-- He has a real
confidence problem.

212
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,698
-Well, not really--
-George.

213
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,237
I know you told him
that you didn't have the hat...

214
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,276
...because you didn't want to see
him again, and more sympathetic...

215
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,276
...I could not be...

216
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,508
...but I really do need
to have the hat back.

217
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,381
Look. I don't know what to tell you,
but there's no hat here.

218
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,318
I mean, maybe the maid took it.
I had people over but--

219
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,719
Well, that makes sense.

220
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,952
Well, then you wouldn't mind
if we took a second look around?

221
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,953
Be my guest.

222
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,894
Good to see you again.

223
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,304
She's bluffing. She's got it
stashed away in there somewhere.

224
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,409
This is an absolute disaster.

225
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,444
Oh, I don't know. Check this out.

226
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,586
You stole her clock?

227
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,155
Well done.

228
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,055
Yep. This is one for our side.

229
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,383
What is that creaking?

230
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,385
It's like I'm in the hold of a ship.

231
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,614
I've gotta relax.

232
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,989
Hello?

233
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,493
Is somebody there?

234
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,898
Mr. Marbles?

235
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,203
So I told lpswich I'd have
the hat by this afternoon.

236
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,937
-What am I going to do?
-You should sleep with him.

237
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,580
Hi, buddy.

238
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,249
I'm on no sleep, no sleep.

239
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,519
You don't know what it's like.
Things are creaking and cracking...

240
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,391
...and that red light
is burning my brain.

241
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,464
-You look a little stressed.
-Oh, I'm stressed.

242
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,697
So, Kramer, what am l
supposed to do?

243
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,739
If I don't have that fur hat by 4:00...

244
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,207
...they're gonna take me down
like Nixon.

245
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,938
You know my friend
Bob Sacamano?

246
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,604
I thought he was Kramer's friend.

247
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,478
He called last night about
3 a.m. and we got to talking.

248
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,418
He sells Russian hats
down at Battery Park, 40 bucks.

249
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,387
Forty bucks? Are they sable?

250
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,823
No, but the difference is negligible.

251
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,521
Oh, yeah, I like this idea.

252
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,529
-All right. Let's give it a shot. Let's go.
-Giddyup.

253
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,566
-It's getting cold. It's getting cold.
-That was a close one.

254
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,369
Why do we have to
keep this from Jerry?

255
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:16,139
If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Rogers
chicken, I'm back with the red menace.

256
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,418
Miss Benes, the hat you charged
to the company was sable.

257
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,353
This is nutria.

258
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:30,256
Well, that's a-- It's a kind of sable.

259
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,929
No, it's a kind of rat.

260
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,225
That's a rat hat?

261
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:41,132
And a poorly made one,
even by rat hat standards.

262
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,940
I've no choice but to
recommended your termination...

263
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,874
...to the board of directors.
Nothing short of the approval...

264
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,447
...of Peterman himself
will save you this time.

265
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,141
But-- But he's in
the Burmese jungle.

266
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,510
And quite mad, too, from what I hear.

267
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,520
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Can I fire you?

268
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,092
No.

269
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,389
-So Heather called?
-Yeah, but get this.

270
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,433
The message said,
"Call me if you have the time."

271
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,366
If I have the time? You got it?

272
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,565
No, but this is all very exciting.

273
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,044
She knows that I have her clock.

274
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,145
I know that she has my hat.

275
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,543
I think she's getting ready
to make an exchange.

276
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,550
Well, there is the possibility that
you've gone right out of your mind.

277
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,882
I've looked at that. It seems unlikely.

278
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,957
Well, I'd look again.

279
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,560
So how come you didn't call
Jerry about all this?

280
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,095
Jerry. I can't talk to Jerry anymore.

281
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,392
Ever since he moved into
that apartment he's too much...

282
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,399
...Iike you.

283
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,504
That's a shame.

284
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,705
Seth, you're the manager.
Can't you turn off that sign?

285
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,506
Jerry, I lied.
I'm just an assistant manager.

286
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,007
Number 67, family feast.

287
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,313
Number 67. Right here. Right here.

288
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,253
-Hello, Newman.
-Hello, Jerry.

289
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,518
And don't forget
your steamed broccoli.

290
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,991
Hold it.

291
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,291
Broccoli? Newman,
you wouldn't eat broccoli...

292
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,263
...if it was deep fried
in chocolate sauce.

293
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:22,536
I love broccoli. It's good for you.

294
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,369
Really?

295
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,540
Then maybe
you'd like to have a piece.

296
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,080
Gladly.

297
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,947
Vile weed!

298
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,385
It's for Kramer, isn't it? I knew it.

299
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,686
The greasy doorknob.
The licking of the fingers.

300
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,058
-He's hooked on the chicken, isn't he?
-Yes! Yes, now, please...

301
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,062
...someone, honey mustard.

302
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,975
Newman, what took you--
Hey, buddy.

303
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,777
-That was good.
-Expecting Newman?

304
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,943
That's funny, because
I happened upon him...

305
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,884
...down at the
Kenny Rogers Roasters.

306
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,991
Kenny Rogers.
Oh, boy, I hate that place.

307
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,185
He was buying quite a load of chicken,
almost enough for two people.

308
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,796
-As long as one of them is not him.
-Yeah.

309
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,695
Oh, hey, you know,
Elaine, she stopped by.

310
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,393
Yeah, dropped off
that Bob Sacamano hat.

311
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,506
Yeah, oh, she's upset with him.
Yes, sirree.

312
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,938
Yeah, well, thanks for stopping by.

313
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,901
I sure do miss my apartment.

314
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,104
Maybe I'll switch back.

315
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,078
You don't want to think about that.

316
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,117
Otherwise, I'd have no choice
but to put that banner back up...

317
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,551
...and run that Rogers
right out of town.

318
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,714
I don't think you will.
As a matter of fact...

319
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,985
...I'll save you the trouble.
I'll do it myself.

320
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,391
Go ahead. Put the banner up.
Doesn't matter to me.

321
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,394
-All right.
-No, Jerry.

322
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,692
I need that chicken!
I've got to have that ch--

323
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,668
Now, you leave those roasters alone!
Kenny never hurt anybody!

324
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,574
-You got a little problem.
-Oh, I got a big problem, Jerry!

325
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,055
Here. Kneel here.

326
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,451
-What?
-Kneel.

327
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,684
Kneel? Okay.

328
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,091
Elaine.

329
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,335
Mr. Peterman.

330
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,844
You speak Burmese?

331
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,709
No, Elaine, that was gibberish.

332
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,053
So did you have any
trouble finding the place?

333
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,314
No, you're the only...

334
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,587
...white-poet-warlord
in the neighborhood.

335
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,057
Are you an assassin?

336
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,098
I work for your mail order catalog.

337
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:07,534
You're an errand girl sent
by grocery clerks to collect a bill.

338
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,972
Well, actually, I do have a bill here.

339
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:16,137
If you could just sign this
expense form...

340
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,045
...I think I could still make
the last fan boat out of here.

341
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,979
I'd be happy to, Elaine.

342
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,712
Here you go.

343
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,416
But I will have to see this hat.

344
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,053
Right.

345
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,936
So how do you want to do this?

346
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,200
All right, George, I'll be honest.

347
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,106
The first time we went out,
I found you very irritating.

348
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,406
But after seeing you
a couple of times...

349
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,681
...you sort of got stuck in my head.

350
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,614
Costanza

351
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,349
So you really don't have my hat?

352
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,354
What?

353
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,827
Let's go do something.

354
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,957
-What's in the bag?
-Oh, that's-- That's a sandwich.

355
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,634
Damn salami.

356
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,642
My clock.

357
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,744
-You stole it?
-That damn delicatessen.

358
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:25,178
That is the last time they
screw up one of my orders.

359
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,784
Hey, Seth. Man, it is coming
down hard out there.

360
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,560
Oh, gross.

361
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,167
That's not gonna be
good for business.

362
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,860
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

363
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,072
Kenny?

364
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,813
Kenny?

365
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,361
Kenny.

366
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,426
Kenny.

367
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,529
Kenny.

368
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,734
Home at last.

369
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,512
Is someone there?

370
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,720
Mr. Marbles.

371
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,647
This is the urban sombrero.

372
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,224
I put it on the last catalogue cover.

373
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,257
The horror.

374
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,427
The horror.
