00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,718
So I was in the drugstore trying to get
a cold medication. You ever try this?

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,233
It's an entire wall of medications.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,109
"All right, all right, okay.
What the hell am I...?

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,558
This is quick-acting,
but this is long-lasting.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,112
When do I need to feel good?
Now or later?"

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,918
It's a tough question.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,719
Then the commercials on TV
show you what's wrong with the guy.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,395
They always show you the problems.
They show you the human body...

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,069
...which is usually this guy:

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,114
No face, mouth open.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,352
This is how drug companies
see the public.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,276
And he's always in, like,
a certain pain.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,749
Like, red, wavy lines are going
through him...

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,469
...or he's glowing.
Parts of him are on fire sometimes.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,471
Lightning is attacking him.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,600
I never had a doctor say,
"Are you having pain?

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,035
Are you having any lightning
with the pain?"

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,476
How did you get fleas?

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,349
My cousin's imbecile dog was outside
and they got in his carpet.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,432
Maybe you could get yourself
a little bow tie flea collar.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,794
That's real funny.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,550
So are you coming to the party?

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,590
I'd go, but Long Island,
it's so far out.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,318
It smacks of desperation.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,879
Everyone's gonna be saying:

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,235
"You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?"

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,630
- You know, Ava's gonna be there.
- Who?

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,552
The nice one that works
in my office.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,079
- I'll drive!
- Oh, well, now you're talking.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,514
Supposed to be a good party.

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,235
Well, what does that mean?
Good dip?

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,632
No. There'll be girls there.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,313
There's girls everywhere!

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,471
I go out and there's girls
in the elevator.

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,518
They're in cafeterias, subways.
So what?

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,910
There's a hundred
different things here.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,148
What's the difference
between these two?

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,512
- You got propylparaben?
- Got it.

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,593
You got isobutane 30?

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,432
I got isobutane 20.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,759
You got sorbitan sesquioleate?

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,512
- Got it.
- I have aloe.

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,671
You got aloe?
I love aloe.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,239
Where do they make yours?

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,879
- Jersey.
- White Plains.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,234
Girls.
There's girls right here in the store.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,353
Look. Look. There's one over there.
Look.

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,079
There's another one.

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,915
As soon as I walk outside,
there'll be girls.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,839
What's the matter?

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,991
I gave her a 20,
she gave me change for a 10.

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,550
Are you sure?
Oh, boy. Here we go.

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,995
Excuse me.
I gave you a $20 bill...

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,878
...and you only gave me
change for a 10.

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,679
- You gave me a 10.
- I'm positive I gave you a 20.

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,432
I know what you gave me.

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,999
You owe me $10.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,309
Will you please step aside?

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,072
- Next!
- All right, all right.

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,800
Let's just examine the situation
for a second.

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,351
Who, in this situation, would be
more likely to make a mistake?

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,514
Me, who had access to my wallet,
knew exactly what was in there...

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,908
...or you?
- You.

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,710
No, no, no. See, you're not
really listening.

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,075
- What's the problem here?
- There's no problem.

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,753
She just owes me $10. That's all.

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,195
- He's claiming short.
- Let's just take it outside.

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,590
Oh, so you don't believe me either?!

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,479
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right. You haven't won.

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,074
You may think you've won,
but you haven't won. Know why?

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,912
It's not over. This is not over.

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,152
I'm not forgetting what's happening
here. You have my $10.

73
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,153
I will get it back. All right.
Don't worry.

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,356
And it's not over.
I'm going now.

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,193
Goodbye. I will be back.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,117
Well, don't stand here.
Let's walk in.

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,429
Blend in. Blend in.

78
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,034
No, let's survey first.
Camp here.

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,713
Ava.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,674
What could possess anyone
to throw a party?

81
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,389
I mean, to have a bunch of strangers
treat your house like a hotel room.

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,792
- Guess who just sold 129 West 81 st.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,473
- Get out! When?
- Yesterday.

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,558
- I don't believe it.
- Ask Mark.

85
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,280
Mark, is this true?

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,276
Yeah, this has got "disaster"
written all over it.

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,752
How did I let you talk me into this?
I must have been out of my mind.

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,831
Listen, let's keep an eye
on each other.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,719
In case one of us gets
in a bad conversation...

90
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,316
...we should have a signal
so the other one can get us out of it.

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,315
- How old are you?
- Thirty-six.

92
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,559
What's the signal?

93
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,672
How about this: Chicken wing.

94
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,474
No, no, no.
I got a better one:

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,153
Head-patting.

96
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,552
Whatever you want.

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,516
You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?

98
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,398
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,311
So, what do you do?

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,512
- I'm a comedian.
- Are you?

101
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,513
Let me ask you something.
Where do you get your material?

102
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,274
- I hear a voice.
- What kind of voice?

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,274
A man's voice. But he speaks in
German, so I have to get it translated.

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,591
How come you keep tapping
your head?

105
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,079
It's a nervous tick.

106
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,878
I'm on L-dopa.

107
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,795
On the other hand, you take a guy
like George Washington Carver.

108
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,191
The man devoted his whole life
to the peanut.

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,432
Imagine having so much passion
for something.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,719
You know, people tell me
I'm a funny guy.

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,433
I've often wondered if he ever worked
with the pecan.

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,032
Yeah. Me too.

113
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,193
Now, is that considered a nut?
I know the cashew is a legume.

114
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,950
- How's it going?
- Great. How about you?

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,318
I can't believe
what's happening here.

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,391
She hasn't taken her hands
off me all night.

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,313
She was always friendly around
the office, but that was it.

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,436
- How do you account for this?
- I don't know.

119
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,636
Maybe a safe fell on her head.

120
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,432
Well, she obviously
liked you all along.

121
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,192
No. I would have picked up on it.

122
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,670
I can always tell. Women always
somehow let you know.

123
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,195
With me, they could torture me,
I wouldn't tell them.

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,430
I try to make them think
I don't like them.

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,795
Then they think,
"Oh, this guy's not even looking.

126
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,871
He must have something
going for him."

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,996
Anyway, I'm ready to go.

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,469
- Now?
- Well, if not now, when?

129
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,033
- Give me a half-hour.
- Okay. Half-hour.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,034
Peanut brittle, peanut butter,
peanut oil...

131
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,519
Can I talk to you for a second?

132
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,352
Oh, excuse me.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,357
What have you been doing? I've
been smacking myself senseless.

134
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,832
People think I'm a mental patient.

135
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,839
Hey, I was dying over there.

136
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,036
This guy's going off on the peanut.

137
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,792
Now, pay attention.

138
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,156
Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.

139
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,039
- You talk about everyday things, right?
- Right.

140
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,270
Yeah. I remember you.

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,591
I wonder what happened
to my fiancé.

142
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,439
I know he's here somewhere.

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,434
Ellen, have you seen my fiancé?

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,556
- He's upstairs.
- Are you going upstairs?

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,109
Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.

146
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,273
I have lost my fiancé,
the poor baby.

147
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,751
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

148
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,508
What?

149
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,957
The dingo ate your baby.

150
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,189
You ready?

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,949
Listen, I...

152
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,712
...have a tremendous favour to ask.

153
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,074
I do favours.

154
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,108
- I think something's happening here.
- What?

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,272
I think she wants me
to take her home.

156
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,237
- What should I do?
- Go. What can you do?

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,636
- What about you and Elaine?
- We'll get a ride.

158
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,950
- You're sure?
- We'll be fine. What did she say?

159
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,794
She told me she...

160
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,759
She told me she wants me
to make love to her.

161
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,429
- What? She said that?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,549
- Get out of here.
- I swear.

163
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,433
- What did you say?
- I...

164
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,679
- Oh, I can't.
- Come on. What did you say?

165
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,751
- Please, it's, it's...
- What?

166
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,199
"I..."

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,712
"I..."

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,355
"I long for you."

169
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,278
- "I long for you"?
- I was so shocked...

170
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,592
...I was lucky I said anything.
- It's okay. That's not bad.

171
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,196
I don't like when a woman says
"Make love to me." It's intimidating.

172
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,796
The last time a woman said that to me,
I wound up apologizing to her.

173
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,999
- Really?
- That's a lot of pressure.

174
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,550
"Make love to me."
What am I, in the circus?

175
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,517
- What if I can't deliver?
- Oh, come on.

176
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,238
I can't perform under pressure.

177
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,791
That's why I never play anything
for money. I choke.

178
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,996
I could choke tonight.

179
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,037
And she works in my office.
Can you imagine?

180
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,475
If she goes around telling everyone
what happened...

181
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,279
Maybe I should cancel.
I have a very bad feeling about this.

182
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,468
- George, you're thinking too much.
- I know, I know. I can't stop it.

183
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,276
Well, right now I'm reading
manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.

184
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
Pendant? Those bastards.

185
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,355
Excuse me.

186
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
Listen, George is going home
with this Ava from his office.

187
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,432
Really?

188
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,358
What a world.

189
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,038
- So we can go now.
- No, he's taking the car.

190
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,638
- What are we gonna do for a ride?
- I don't know.

191
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,152
- You don't know?
- Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.

192
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,517
Great. Oh, this is great.
How could you let him take the car?

193
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,274
There's nothing I could do.
It's part of the code.

194
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,749
All plans between men are tentative.

195
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,191
If one man should suddenly have
an opportunity to pursue a woman...

196
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,397
...it's like these two guys never met
each other ever in life.

197
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,393
This is the male code.

198
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,478
And it doesn't matter how important
the arrangements are.

199
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,473
Most of the time, they screw up
a space shuttle mission, it's because...

200
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,473
...one of the astronauts met someone
on his way to the launch pad.

201
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,835
They hold that countdown.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,752
He's leaning against the rocket:

203
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,549
"So when I get back, what do you say
we get together for some Tang?"

204
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,948
Oh, look at what she's wearing.
You see what she's wearing?

205
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,314
Yeah, yeah, all right.

206
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,630
I can't believe
she's walking around in that.

207
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,030
- Just don't make a scene.
- Hey, is that real fur?

208
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,077
- Oh, boy.
- It better be.

209
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,912
Or my ex-husband owes me
an explanation.

210
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,308
Good night.

211
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,835
You don't care that innocent,
defenceless animals...

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,433
...are tortured so you look good?

213
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,352
Could we talk about this
some other time?

214
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,636
- Are you a vegetarian?
- Here we go.

215
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,711
Yeah. I eat fish occasionally.

216
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,279
- So you're a hypocrite.
- Hey!

217
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,829
I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,149
Anyway...

219
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,517
- Talk to me when you stop eating fish.
- Fish don't feel any pain.

220
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,591
How do you know?
Do you communicate with fish?

221
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,637
Well, they're not kept in little cages.

222
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,552
- Ever seen a goldfish?
- Goldfish!

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,915
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen goldfish.
They're not unhappy.

224
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,832
Right. Swim around a bowl
for two weeks...

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,309
...and get flushed down the toilet.
That's a good life.

226
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,913
Oh, yeah. That's right.

227
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,469
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Maybe you can run over a squirrel!

228
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,996
Yeah, well, that's why we're here
in America.

229
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,994
- You're beautiful.
- Call Kramer.

230
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,752
All right.

231
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,150
Excuse me.
This is your party, right?

232
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,914
- No. I just live here.
- Can I use your phone?

233
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,308
What's in it for me?

234
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,596
- A bigger bill.
- Go for it.

235
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,158
Kram, Sein.

236
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,912
What are you doing?

237
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,510
Well, I'm stuck out here
on Long Island.

238
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,875
What are your thoughts
about taking a ride?

239
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,598
You're sure?

240
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,797
Okay, but don't leave me
hanging here.

241
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,678
Okay, great.
Let me give you directions.

242
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,276
You sure you don't need any help?

243
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,396
No, not really.

244
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,516
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

245
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,238
I want them out of here.

246
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,637
- Call him again.
- I called. What should I do?

247
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,197
We really appreciate this.

248
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,917
It's 2:00 in the morning.

249
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,877
Oh, you got the <i>Civil War</i> book.

250
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,591
I saw some of that show.
It was wonderful.

251
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,718
620 million people died.

252
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,029
Thousand.

253
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,760
Thousand! 620,000.

254
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,115
The horror. The horror!

255
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,669
The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.

256
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,718
Are you sure you gave him
the right directions?

257
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,677
- You sure there's nothing we can do?
- No!

258
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,876
I am not going to bed
with them in our house.

259
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,268
This is ridiculous.

260
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,149
You know, a friend of my father's
used to live right around here.

261
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,313
Mike Wichter.

262
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,078
He sold plastic straws.

263
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,389
You know the ones?

264
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,073
You could bend them.

265
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,149
Have you noticed? People don't use
straws as much as they used to.

266
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,073
You know, it doesn't look
as if your friend is coming.

267
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,229
Oh, he's coming.

268
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,676
Maybe you should take a look
at a train schedule.

269
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,278
That's him.

270
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,398
I'm going to bed!

271
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,673
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

272
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,838
Great party.

273
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,715
- Hey, how you doing?
- Look who's here.

274
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,919
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.

275
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,196
I had the directions on the seat
right next to me.

276
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,157
They flew out the window.

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,558
Then how did you find the place?

278
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,029
Well, I knew the exit
on the Long Island Expressway...

279
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,637
...and I thought that the address
was 8713 Riviera Drive.

280
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,836
So I drove around...

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,355
...knocking on everybody's doors
that had those numbers.

282
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,196
8317, 7813, 3718, 1837...

283
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,076
Finally, I hit it. 8173.

284
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,029
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us
stay here, Steve. I really owe you one.

285
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,394
No problem.

286
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,357
And if you're ever in the city...

287
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,750
...you wanna come to a comedy club,
whatever.

288
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,831
Hey, I might take you up on that.

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,195
Here's my address and number.

290
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,918
And, really, thanks again.

291
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,554
Well, you better zip up.

292
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,190
I couldn't get the top
on the convertible up.

293
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,109
- But it's cold out.
- Wait till we get on the Expressway.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,310
George, I've been sick all week.
Elaine was too.

295
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,313
Eighty miles an hour, 40 degree
temperature for 50 minutes.

296
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,152
Do the math.

297
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,918
Yeah, maybe I will get out.

298
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,197
But let me just stop off
at the drugstore first.

299
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,272
Meet me down there in 15 minutes,
then we'll go do something.

300
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,919
Yeah, Selwyn's.

301
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,274
Okay, bye.

302
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,999
- Who is it?
- Mr. Pocatillo!

303
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,470
- Who?
- You don't recognize my voice?

304
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,153
- Jerry, baby!
- Do I know you?

305
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,870
- Boy, this comedy's frying your brain.
- I'm sorry...

306
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,918
See, this is the kind of lasting
impression I make on people.

307
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,550
- Oh, okay.
- You said if I was ever in the city.

308
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,593
I'm in the city!

309
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,035
You certainly are.

310
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,315
What's going on?

311
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,916
I'm just waiting for a lift back.
He won't be ready until 11.

312
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,519
I figured I'd give you a break...

313
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,319
...see what it's like to hang out
with someone in show business.

314
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,234
Listen, I'm really sorry, but I'm just
on my way out to meet a friend.

315
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,358
Oh, come on. You can come up
with something better than that.

316
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,556
No, really, I just got off the phone
with him.

317
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,078
I understand.

318
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,029
Look, you can hang out here
if you want.

319
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,679
Don't be so enthusiastic.

320
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,758
- No, it's...
- I'm not gonna steal anything.

321
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,275
No, of course not. Just...

322
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,112
...close the door when you leave.

323
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,192
- I think I can do that.
- Really, I'm sorry.

324
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,588
Maybe another time.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,558
Yeah. Let's have lunch.

326
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,155
The guy's in my house right now.

327
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,710
What a mistake that party was.
I never should've gone.

328
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,189
- Yeah, me either.
- Oh, come on.

329
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,797
What "come on"? Have you ever dated
a woman that worked in your office?

330
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,629
- I never had a job.
- Know that anxiety you feel on a date?

331
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,633
That's what I have every day now.
My worst nightmare's come true.

332
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,518
Every day is a date.

333
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,593
That's one of Dante's nine stages
of hell, isn't it?

334
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,716
Ava was one of the reasons
I used to like work.

335
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,199
She was a friend.

336
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,591
Now we sleep together and suddenly
I don't know how to talk to her.

337
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,990
Every time I go to the bathroom,
I pass her desk.

338
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,197
I have to plan little patter.
I spend half my day writing.

339
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,113
Then afterwards I sit in my office
and analyse how it went.

340
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,716
If it was a good conversation, I don't
go to the bathroom the rest of the day.

341
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,110
I see her laughing
and talking with other people.

342
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,350
They're all so loose and relaxed.
I think:

343
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,273
"That used to be me.
I wanna go back there again."

344
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,000
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no choice.

345
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,639
I'm quitting.

346
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,754
The party, Long Island.

347
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,917
- Kramer, right?
- Yeah.

348
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,355
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Waiting for my ride.

349
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,750
- Where's Jerry?
- He split.

350
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,911
Let me ask you something.

351
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,992
Is there anything to drink in here?
Or is that a stupid question?

352
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,997
Jerry, he doesn't have anything.

353
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,111
But I might have something.

354
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,871
I'm gonna get this.
This looks good.

355
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,434
- How much is that?
- $9.60.

356
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,632
$9.60?

357
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,635
Give it to me.

358
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,153
- Why?
- Don't worry, I got it.

359
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,476
- What do you mean, you got it?
- I got it.

360
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,996
Since when are you treating me
to medicine? What are you doing?

361
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,398
- You're stealing this, aren't you?
- I'm not stealing. They owe me $10.

362
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,198
- They stole from me.
- You're a lunatic.

363
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,032
I have to. It's a matter of honour.

364
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,158
What do you say
to a person like you?

365
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,839
Just walk.
You don't even know me.

366
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,434
Excuse me.

367
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,514
What do you got there?

368
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,077
- What?
- What do you got in your shirt?

369
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,597
- I was gonna pay for this.
- Come with me.

370
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,955
Where are you taking me?
I was gonna pay for it.

371
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,588
- Don't think I remember you?
- What are you talking about?

372
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,432
I know who you are!
I was watching you.

373
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,750
What are you gonna do?
You gonna call the police?

374
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,990
- Come on!
- Where...!

375
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,151
Can I still buy this
or is this evidence now?

376
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,550
So I'm chasing these doves
down the street...

377
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,439
...and she's screaming
at the top of her lungs...

378
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,034
...and then when the magician
comes back from Europe...

379
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,077
...two of them turn brown!

380
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,152
Well, I followed the instructions!

381
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,876
They turned brown!

382
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,556
- Brown!
- Brown!

383
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,435
So let me ask you something.
You know any women we could call?

384
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,272
Not really.

385
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,030
Maybe we should call
one of those escort services.

386
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,269
Yeah.

387
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,116
I saw one of them advertised
before on the cable station.

388
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,032
555-LOVE.

389
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,632
- Are you in on this?
- Oh, no, no.

390
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,360
I got a girl in the next building.

391
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,316
Now, I want my money, mister!
And I ain't leaving till I get it.

392
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,431
Now, I am through
playing games with you.

393
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,272
I got things to do.

394
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,597
Oh, Jerry, Jerry.

395
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,352
Look who's here.
It's Jerry.

396
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,669
What the hell...?

397
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,037
- Jerry, this is Patti.
- Nice to meet you.

398
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,872
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

399
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,393
What the hell is going on here?

400
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,790
I don't know,
but I gotta do this more often.

401
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,596
There's my ride, finally.

402
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,593
I'm not gonna go anywhere
until I get the rest of my money.

403
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,230
See you, Jer, and tell Kramer thanks.
I'll call him tomorrow.

404
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,674
Oh, Kramer.

405
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,717
Yeah, he's a hoot.

406
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,919
Goodbye, my dear.

407
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,758
Weekend of the 26th, come on out.
We're having another party.

408
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,594
I ain't leaving.

409
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,794
- Patti.
- You got anything to drink?

410
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,832
- All right, how much does he owe you?
- $50.

411
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,957
Fifty dollars...

412
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,436
- Is this your apartment?
- Yeah, but...

413
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,434
- You're under arrest for solicitation.
- Oh, wait a second. I...

414
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,919
I have chicken soup.

415
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,594
Is that real fur?

416
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,512
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

417
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,034
You had Sergeant Chadway?
Me too.

418
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,709
- He was a nice guy.
- Oh, great guy.

419
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,791
Was there a redheaded guy there?

420
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,712
- The one with the long sideburns?
- Yeah!

421
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,359
- Where does he come off?
- I know.

422
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,875
There's no call
for that kind of attitude.

423
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,875
One of the guys in my cell
threw a piece of gum at him.

424
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,270
We all hated him.

425
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,350
There's two types of favours:
Big favour, small favour.

426
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,590
You can measure the size
of the favour...

427
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,356
...by the pause that a person takes
after they ask you to "do me a favour."

428
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,872
Small favour, small pause:
"Do me a favour? Hand me that pencil."

429
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,314
No pause at all.

430
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,074
Big favours are:
"Could you do me a favour?"

431
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,231
