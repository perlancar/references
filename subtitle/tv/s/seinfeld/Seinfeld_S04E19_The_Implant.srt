1
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:07,711
I don't belong to a health club. I have a
limit on naked men I see in one day.

2
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:09,508
Zero.

3
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:11,446
That's it.

4
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:14,644
What is with the high level of security
at health clubs, you know?

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:17,153
The picture IDs. Security guards.
Signing in and out.

6
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:18,985
What is this, the Kremlin?

7
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:23,653
I mean, the people with a membership
go twice a year. Who's breaking in?

8
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:28,491
Is this a big problem,
people stealing exercise?

9
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:31,763
And what if they catch the person?
What then? They run. It's aerobic.

10
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:33,907
Makes it even worse.

11
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,213
- Hi, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Sidra.

12
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:45,476
I last about 10 minutes
on the StairMaster.

13
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:49,520
Unless someone's stretching in front of
me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.

14
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:52,321
- Really?
- That's why it's called the StairMaster.

15
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:54,483
You get up there and you stare.

16
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:58,490
Well, I'm done.
I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.

17
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:00,098
I'll see you Thursday night?

18
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:01,666
- Thursday night.
- Okay.

19
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:05,395
Good workout?

20
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,767
Tremendous workout.

21
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:11,668
- It's a pretty girl.
- Tremendous girl.

22
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:14,939
- She the one you went out with?
- Yeah. I really like her.

23
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:18,516
You know, they're fake.

24
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:23,349
- What? Don't say that.
- No. They're fake.

25
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:25,514
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

26
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,388
You know how you always brag
how you can spot a lesbian?

27
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:32,197
I'm not bragging. I happen to
have a very keen lesbian eye.

28
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,732
Hi, how you doing?

29
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,369
Oh, right.

30
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:41,303
Come on. Don't you think
they seem just a bit too perfect?

31
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,466
Yes, they do.

32
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:47,878
I never knew you were into breasts.
Thought you were a leg man.

33
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:52,815
Leg man? Why would I be a leg man?
I don't need legs. I have legs.

34
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,521
Have you seen her naked
in the locker room?

35
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,521
- No.
- Then I can't accept your testimony.

36
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:00,023
Maybe if you'd seen her naked.

37
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:02,423
- I don't wanna see her naked.
- Well, I do.

38
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:04,530
Well, that's your problem.

39
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:07,667
Look, you made the allegation.
The least you could do is follow up.

40
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:11,898
Jerry, what am I gonna do? Go in
there and spy on her in the sauna?

41
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:15,872
Yes. Go in there. Do a little
investigative journalism.

42
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,271
I need to know.

43
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:20,504
But a few more dates,
you can find out for yourself.

44
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,410
Don't be so sure. Look at George.

45
00:02:22,582 --> 00:02:25,278
He's on his ninth date with Betsy.
Still hasn't got anywhere.

46
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:26,680
What's his problem?

47
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:29,014
Every time he makes a move
something screws up.

48
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,986
Their last date
they were on the couch...

49
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:33,456
...but she was on his wrong side.
- Wrong side?

50
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:37,085
Yeah, she was on his right side. He
can't make a move with his left hand.

51
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:38,561
Can't go left.

52
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,930
- He can't go left?
- No.

53
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,763
I'm lefty. Can't go right.

54
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:46,067
What about women?
They go left or right?

55
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,537
No, we just play defense.

56
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:12,825
Could I ask you a question?

57
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:16,127
Would you mind switching seats?

58
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:24,567
Actually, I'd really prefer to sit here.
I don't hear very well out of this ear.

59
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:29,307
I always try to sit
to the right of people.

60
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:32,183
I'll shout.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,988
Well, I really think
I feel more comfortable here.

62
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:37,919
Come on, come on.

63
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:39,786
- Come on, really. Come on.
- George, l...

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,224
- Now, come on.
- No, I really...

65
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:51,498
See, now is that so bad?

66
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,161
What?

67
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,499
- Oh, l...
- The machine will get it.

68
00:03:56,676 --> 00:03:57,904
No, it's not on.

69
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:00,842
- They'll call back.
- George, what if it's an emergency?

70
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:03,710
In the whole world right now
there's maybe three emergencies.

71
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:06,819
Why would you think on this
planet that you're one of those three?

72
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,683
George, please.

73
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,922
Hello.

74
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,489
What?

75
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:17,994
Oh, my God.

76
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:21,634
All right, maybe four.

77
00:04:24,204 --> 00:04:26,468
Boy, I'm really sweating.

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,201
Good sweat. Beads of sweat.
Sweating bullets.

79
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,200
Look at her.

80
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:35,212
I don't need to see her naked
to know those aren't real.

81
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,714
I mean, why'd she even
tie the towel around her?

82
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:40,478
She's got a rack on her chest.

83
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,222
Oh, God.
Sidra's taking the towel off.

84
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:50,590
Doctor.

85
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:51,992
That's it.

86
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,759
I knew it. I knew it.
They're definitely fake.

87
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:57,199
So when's the funeral?

88
00:04:58,538 --> 00:04:59,869
Oh, well.

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,342
Aunt Clarice was so ill
I guess it was really a blessing.

90
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,889
Yeah, I'll fly home
as soon as I can.

91
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:27,163
Okay. You too. Get some sleep.

92
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,031
- You're sure?
- Positive.

93
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:39,007
This chick's playing
with Confederate money.

94
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,942
Then that's it.
That's the end of that.

95
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:43,309
- What? Just because that?
- Just because of that?

96
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:46,680
It's like finding out
Mickey Mantle corked his bat.

97
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,315
You've dated women with nose jobs.
What's the difference?

98
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:56,428
You don't touch the nose.
You don't aspire to reach the nose.

99
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,791
You don't unhook anything
to get to a nose...

100
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:02,628
...and no man has ever tried to look
up a woman's nostrils.

101
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:08,069
You've put a lot of thought into this,
haven't you?

102
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,606
Well, I take it very seriously.

103
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:15,080
Sometimes when I think you're
the shallowest man I've ever met...

104
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:18,740
...you somehow manage
to drain a little more out of the pool.

105
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:22,551
- Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:25,454
- Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,287
You know, I do kind of wonder
what fake breasts feel like.

108
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,429
Well, I know what they feel like.

109
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:31,825
You? How do you know?

110
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:34,762
Well, I lived in Los Angeles
for three months.

111
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:37,927
- I thought you hated Los Angeles.
- No, I do.

112
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:40,664
Just miss
the warm weather, you know?

113
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,066
Oh, man, I wish I could get away.

114
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:45,677
Real busy now, down at the office?

115
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,641
No. You know who I saw
at the health club?

116
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,806
Salman Rushdie.

117
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:53,680
- No.
- Yeah, right.

118
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,184
Salman Rushdie.

119
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:58,153
Well, I could see that. You got
five million Moslems after you.

120
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,486
You wanna stay
in pretty good shape.

121
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:02,889
I know what the problem is.

122
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:06,156
I like her too much.
That's why I can't make a move.

123
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,394
- You put her on a pedestal.
- I put them on a dental chair.

124
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:13,169
He puts them on a dental chair.

125
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:16,740
I'm not her boyfriend.
I wanna be her boyfriend.

126
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:21,079
It's like a sauna in here.

127
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,710
- That's funny.
- You're a funny guy.

128
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,787
Never heard that before.

129
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:32,118
So you going to the funeral?

130
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,953
- You think I should?
- Are you kidding?

131
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,527
It's a golden opportunity
to advance the relationship.

132
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:39,256
She's crying. You put your arm
around her and console her.

133
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:41,195
You're the consolation guy.

134
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:45,828
- I'm the consolation guy.
- Consolation guy is big.

135
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,564
Her aunt dying
is the best thing for you.

136
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:51,336
It's like 10 dates in one shot.

137
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,344
This confers upon you
instant boyfriend status.

138
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:57,039
The family's there.

139
00:07:57,217 --> 00:08:01,210
You're taking care of things. You're
getting sandwiches. You're the rock.

140
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,788
It's in Detroit, though.
It's an expensive flight.

141
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:07,051
Why don't you get a
"death in the family" fare?

142
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:08,785
What?

143
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,456
Go to the airlines. Tell them
that you have a death in the family...

144
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,999
...they give you
50 percent off the fare.

145
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,431
- Really?
- In fact...

146
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,903
...listen, I'll go with you. We'll tell them
there's a death in my family.

147
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,201
You buy the ticket. I'll split it.

148
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:27,608
Then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll
get to Detroit for a quarter of the price.

149
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:34,078
Boy, I'm getting a good sweat here.
Great sweat. Good beads. Nice beads.

150
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:40,323
Oh, look who's here.
Silicon Valley.

151
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:45,293
Oh, so anyway. We go out on one date,
and he asks me out for a second...

152
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:48,059
...and then out of nowhere he calls me,
cancels the date...

153
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:50,725
...and says
he doesn't wanna see me again.

154
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:54,466
Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing.

155
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:57,405
- Oh, that's okay.
- Did he give you a reason?

156
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:00,512
Yeah. He's going back
to his old girlfriend.

157
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:02,342
Really?

158
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,449
Said she's mentally ill.

159
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:10,890
He's one of those guys who is
obsessed with neatness and order.

160
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:15,517
Everything has gotta be just so.
He would have made a great Nazi.

161
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,600
Hey, does he ever
talk about Superman?

162
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:26,102
- Yes. How did you know?
- I know the type.

163
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:28,297
- Oh, so you can relate?
- Oh, yeah.

164
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:32,309
You know, I've seen you around the
club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.

165
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,107
- Oh, hi. I'm Elaine.
- Hi.

166
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:45,146
Anyway, I stood up to shake her hand
and suddenly I lost my balance...

167
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,226
...and I fell right into her.
- You fell on her?

168
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:50,219
I touched them.

169
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:53,293
You what?

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,163
I touched them.

171
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:58,565
You touched them?

172
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:01,605
I needed them to help me
break my fall.

173
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,538
If it hadn't been for them,
I could have really injured myself.

174
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:09,470
Anyway...

175
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,544
...they're real.

176
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:15,249
Excuse me.

177
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:18,054
I think they might be real.

178
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:21,421
Oh, what do you know? You have
no breast-touching experience.

179
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:24,927
- I've touched mine.
- So have I.

180
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:28,164
Oh, right, I forgot.

181
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:34,265
Anyway, touching two breasts
doesn't make you an expert.

182
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:41,277
All right. Anyway, I think they're real,
and if they are, they are spectacular.

183
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:45,779
What are you doing to me?

184
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:50,819
You see...

185
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,959
...my friend here,
his aunt passed away last...

186
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:55,685
Oh, I'm very sorry.

187
00:10:55,862 --> 00:11:01,266
I saw her last week. She looked
healthy and peaceful but she knew.

188
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,561
You poor thing.

189
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:07,762
You don't think you could buy
the ticket yourself? Oh, no, okay.

190
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,934
- I couldn't...
- No, please. There, there. You sit.

191
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,443
I'll purchase the ticket for you.

192
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:15,979
You're a good friend.

193
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,542
I understand you offer a
50-percent-off bereavement fare?

194
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,487
Yes. You have to pay the full fare now
then return to one of our counters...

195
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:29,856
...with a copy of the death certificate,
and we'll refund half your fare.

196
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:34,300
The death certificate?

197
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:38,665
Yes, we do need documentation
or people could take advantage.

198
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:43,002
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?

199
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,905
I know but it happens.

200
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:50,482
You want my friend to ask his uncle,
a man who lost his wife of 44 years...

201
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,517
...for a death certificate to
save a few bucks on a flight?

202
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:56,814
That would be $387 round trip.

203
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,391
- You'll need my frequent flyer number.
- Yes.

204
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,325
I don't know.
One minute they're fake...

205
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:07,932
...the next they're real.
I don't know what to believe.

206
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:11,935
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only
one who's touched them.

207
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,338
Well, you were grabbing
onto them to save your life.

208
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,500
If you were drowning and
I threw you a life preserver...

209
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:21,112
...you think you could tell
me if it was an inflatable?

210
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,772
I wouldn't have said anything if
I'd known you'd stop seeing her.

211
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,011
I don't mind a phony personality
but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

212
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,181
- Hey.
- Hey.

213
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:33,882
- George off to Detroit?
- Yep. And in two days...

214
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,187
...l'm off to Puerto Rico.

215
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:38,524
Hey, Kramer, by the way...

216
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:42,361
...I saw that guy at the health club.
That is not Salman Rushdie.

217
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:44,368
Wrong.

218
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:48,672
- There's Sidra.
- There's Salman.

219
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,433
- Where?
- Talking to that woman.

220
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,976
- To Sidra?
- lf that's Sidra, she's talking to Salman.

221
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:55,512
- I don't think that's Salman.
- I don't think they're real.

222
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:58,082
- lf that's Rushdie, they're real.
- lf they're real, that's Rushdie.

223
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:00,685
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Sidra.
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Salman.

224
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:05,722
Like a sauna in here, huh?

225
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:11,494
Feel like I'm back at the desert.

226
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,927
- You've lived in the desert?
- Oh, yeah. I've...

227
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:21,039
I spent a little time
in the Mideast.

228
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,300
You ever been to the Mideast?

229
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:28,243
- Yes, I've been there.
- Look, my name's Kramer.

230
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:30,043
- Sal Bass.
- Yeah.

231
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:32,184
- Pleased to meet you, Kramer.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:35,015
So...

233
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:38,187
...what kind of work do you do?

234
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,793
I'm a writer.

235
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:47,297
- Have you met my boyfriend, George?
- No.

236
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:50,436
George, this is Aunt May
and Father Jessup.

237
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,628
Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy.

238
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:55,467
This is my boyfriend, George.

239
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:58,303
Oh, George, how nice of you
to come all this way.

240
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:03,643
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise,
what's the point of being the boyfriend.

241
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:07,377
This is where you have to be
when you're the boyfriend.

242
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:10,547
Betsy, dear,
have you had anything to eat?

243
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:14,022
- I'm not very hungry.
- They have some very nice snacks.

244
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:17,219
I'm about to get myself a snack.

245
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:19,922
Oh, no. You sit right here.

246
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:22,863
I will get you a nice snack.

247
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:29,341
This is my...

248
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:32,204
...third wake this month.

249
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,005
Never gets any easier.

250
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,513
Well, losing a loved one is...

251
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,913
I mean, forget about it.

252
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,456
You...

253
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,265
You seem to be of great comfort
to Betsy. We're very appreciative.

254
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,493
Comfort "schmomfort."

255
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:02,606
Listen, Father,
can I ask you a question?

256
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:05,603
In a terrible time like this...

257
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:08,941
...who would I get the
death certificate from?

258
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,685
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, how can you be so sure?

259
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:18,984
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer.
He said his name was Sal Bass.

260
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:20,455
Bass, Jerry.

261
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,720
Instead of salmon,
he went with bass.

262
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:26,990
He just substituted
one fish for another.

263
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:31,797
Look, you idiot, first of all,
it's "Salman," not "salmon."

264
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:34,701
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing
the big picture.

265
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:37,342
All right. Maybe it is,
but listen, I gotta get ready...

266
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,569
...Sidra's coming over
so if you don't mind...

267
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:43,237
- What, did you ask her?
- I'm gonna find out tonight.

268
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,316
Yes.

269
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:49,586
Why do you need
a death certificate?

270
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:53,715
Well, Dr. Allenwood...

271
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,152
...I was hoping to compile an...

272
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,700
...admittedly rudimentary
scrapbook of her life.

273
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:06,768
Something that Betsy
could have and hold on to.

274
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,567
Well, I suppose I could
make a copy of it.

275
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,266
Oh, that would be wonderful.

276
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:15,279
- Well, it's nice meeting you, George.
- Likewise.

277
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:31,956
What are you doing?

278
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:35,397
- What?
- Did...?

279
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:37,627
Did you just double dip that chip?

280
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,569
- Excuse me?
- You double dipped the chip.

281
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,072
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?

282
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:46,575
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite...

283
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,873
...and you dipped again.

284
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,283
- So?
- It's like putting your whole mouth...

285
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:55,477
...right in the dip.

286
00:16:56,756 --> 00:17:02,422
From now on, when you take a chip
just take one dip and end it.

287
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:08,929
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...

288
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:11,126
...but I don't dip that way.

289
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:13,101
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.

290
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:16,105
You dip the way you wanna dip...

291
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:18,004
...l'll dip the way I wanna dip.

292
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:19,735
- Give me the chip.
- Hey, hey, hey!

293
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,140
Give me the chip.

294
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:25,840
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I must be crazy.

295
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:41,261
- Hey, you mind switching seats?
- Why?

296
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:45,632
I don't know. I like sitting to the left of
people. Makes me feel like I'm driving.

297
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:48,938
Okay.

298
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,907
- How you doing?
- Good.

299
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,984
- How you doing?
- Good.

300
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,120
Feel good.

301
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:06,481
You know that Jayne Mansfield
had some big breasts.

302
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:12,992
Really big...

303
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:16,328
Huge. Just coming out the top of
her dress. They were choking her.

304
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:20,797
- I hear that's how she died.
- Yeah.

305
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,642
Have you noticed
that women today are...?

306
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,744
You know, they seem bigger.

307
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,406
- A lot of women are having them done.
- Really?

308
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,982
- Yeah.
- How do you like that?

309
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:34,881
A lot of people ask me
if I've had mine done.

310
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:37,454
You know people.

311
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:40,055
Gets a little tiring.
It's none of their business.

312
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:42,751
Oh, the nerve.

313
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:46,928
You know some people have
asked me if you've done that.

314
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,864
And what do you tell them?

315
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:52,093
Whatever you want me
to tell them.

316
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:56,103
Well, I think
you'll find out soon enough.

317
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:05,247
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- No.

318
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,251
- Well, what if it's an emergency?
- Oh, there's no emergency.

319
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:11,754
Jerry. Come on.
It's an emergency.

320
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:15,523
Excuse me.

321
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:18,391
All right.

322
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:20,191
What is it? You're interrupting.

323
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:24,735
I'm packing for Puerto Rico.
I need to borrow your bathing suit.

324
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,467
This is an emergency?
You need a bathing suit?

325
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,902
Well, I like yours.

326
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:34,108
I don't know, my bathing suit?
That's a little familiar.

327
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,681
I don't want your boys down there.

328
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,450
What's the matter with my boys?

329
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:49,219
Your boys should stay
in their neighborhood.

330
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:54,062
- All right, come on.
- All right. It's in the top drawer.

331
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,463
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

332
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,465
- Hi, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.

333
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:03,233
- Oh, hi, Sidra.
- Hi. Elaine?

334
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:09,104
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Kramer.

335
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:10,943
- What's going on?
- She was just...

336
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,483
...showing me pictures
of places in Puerto Rico.

337
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:16,143
- When you two went down there.
- Oh, yeah. All right.

338
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,517
- Well, just...
- You know, these...

339
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,090
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

340
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:26,395
So where were we?

341
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:29,796
- I was just leaving.
- Right. You were leaving.

342
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:32,802
I can't believe you sent a woman
into the sauna to do that?

343
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,769
That was an accident.

344
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,932
I think you're both mentally ill.

345
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:50,484
And by the way, they're real
and they're spectacular.

346
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,249
Stop it, George. Get out. Get out!
I never wanna see you again.

347
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,396
- Go back to New York.
- Get out.

348
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:05,394
All right, sir. Now all I need is a death
certificate and you'll be on your way.

349
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:09,199
Well, you see
what happened was...

350
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:15,938
...the doctor, the very same doctor that
was attending my late aunt suffered...

351
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:18,345
...an untimely stroke...

352
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:22,180
...and lost the use
of his right hand so...

353
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:26,051
...obviously I was unable to get
the death certificate.

354
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:29,217
However, I do have this.

355
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:33,263
What's this?
- A picture of me next to the coffin.

356
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:36,596
- Nice try.
- Not even close, huh?

357
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,236
No.

358
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:45,772
The cosmetic surgery procedures
that are available to people today...

359
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:47,776
Liposuction.
Are you familiar with this?

360
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:50,040
This is a fat-sucking machine.

361
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:52,946
Now, you know, somewhere,
somebody is working on a way...

362
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:55,484
...that this thing could go
into a restaurant.

363
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:57,884
And you could just
order it off the menu.

364
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:00,116
Give me the cheesecake,
crank me up to nine...

365
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,556
...and put a scoop of ice cream
on the side.
