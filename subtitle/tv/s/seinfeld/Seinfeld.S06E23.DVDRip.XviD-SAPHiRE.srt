1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,264
Monkeys are the end of the line
in the pet world.

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:07,963
At that level of pet ownership...

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,508
...have a kid. I mean, come on.
I mean, you're so close.

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,944
If you need a pet that can
roller-skate and smoke cigars...

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,216
...it's time to think about a family.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,745
Monkeys, of course, were the first
astronauts, in the '60s...

7
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,550
...which I'm sure made
perfect sense in the monkey brain.

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,558
"I feel that is the next
logical step for me.

9
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,526
I've been working with the
Italian guy and the crank organ...

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,032
...and I think I'm ready to handle
the maximum-reentry G-forces."

11
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,367
Take toilet paper, for example.

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,039
Do you realize that toilet paper
has not changed in my lifetime?

13
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,481
It's just paper on a cardboard roll.
That's it.

14
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,645
And in 10,000 years,
it will still be exactly the same...

15
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,054
...because, really,
what else can they do?

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,091
Yeah, that's true.

17
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,753
There really has been
no development in toilet paper.

18
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,263
And, I mean, everything else
has changed.

19
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:12,597
But toilet paper is exactly the same,
and will be so until we're dead.

20
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,905
Yeah, you're right, George.

21
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,475
What else can they do?

22
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:22,604
It's just paper on a roll. That's it,
and that's all it will ever be.

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,115
You find this interesting, don't you?

24
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,653
Yes. Yes, I do.

25
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,495
Oh, thanks very much.
The soup was really good.

26
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,771
- What are you telling him for?
- What?

27
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,535
He's the busboy.
You think he cares about the soup?

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,270
Yeah, why, wouldn't he want
the soup to be good?

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,847
Elaine, it's all this guy can do
to keep from killing himself.

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,778
Come on.

31
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,683
You think he's back there with the chef,
going, "Hey, they like the soup!

32
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,517
Keep it up."

33
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,249
- Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,157
Alec Berg. He's got a good
John Houseman name.

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,628
- Yeah.
- Alec Berg.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,131
Mr. Berg.

37
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,826
I can't stand him.
He is so pretentious.

38
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,801
- John Houseman?
- No, Alec Berg.

39
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,770
- Elaine! How are you?
- Hi!

40
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,169
- Jerry.
- Hi, Alec.

41
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,174
- Did you hear about Gary Fogel?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,745
- You gonna go to the funeral Friday?
- Yeah, yeah.

43
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,041
Hey, did I see you on TV
at the Ranger game?

44
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,674
- Those your seats behind the glass?
- Those are them. Season tickets.

45
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,983
Unfortunately, I can't go tonight.
They're available, if you'd like them.

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,489
I'd love to. Are you sure?

47
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,957
Sure. Call my secretary.
She'll arrange everything.

48
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:46,258
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- It's my pleasure. Be good.

49
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:50,994
I actually might not use them
on Friday either, so I'll let you know.

50
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,536
All right. Thanks again.

51
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,070
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,537
Really, thank you.

53
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,346
Well, what about these nitwits that
get on a plane with nothing to read?

54
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,814
- You know who they are?
- Who?

55
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,215
These are the people
that wanna talk to you.

56
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,686
They got nothing else to do,
why not disturb you?

57
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,916
I will never understand people.

58
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,083
They're the worst.

59
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,023
Something's up

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,931
There's something in the air

61
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,636
Well, what is with you?

62
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,201
Well...

63
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,171
...I think this is it.

64
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,810
What's it?

65
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,879
- I saw Siena again.
- Siena?

66
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,881
He's dating a crayon.

67
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,353
We discussed toilet paper.

68
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,958
- Toilet paper?
- Yep, yep.

69
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,821
I told her how toilet paper
hasn't changed in my lifetime...

70
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,327
...and probably wouldn't
for the next 50,000 years...

71
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,694
...and she was fascinated,
fascinated!

72
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,725
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,234
- Toilet paper's changed.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,632
- It's softer.
- Softer.

75
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,137
- More sheets per roll.
- Sheets.

76
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,138
- A wide variety of colors.
- Colors.

77
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,106
Okay, fine. Fine!

78
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,473
It's changed!
It's not really the point.

79
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,009
Anyway, I'm thinking
of making a big move.

80
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,218
What?

81
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,980
I might tell her that I love her.

82
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,255
Oh, my.

83
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,456
I came this close last night,
and then I just sort of chickened out.

84
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,498
Well, that's a big move,
Georgie boy.

85
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,931
Are you confident
in the "I love you" return?

86
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,002
Fifty-fifty.

87
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,800
Because if you don't get
that return...

88
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,274
...that's a pretty big matzo ball
hanging out there.

89
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:45,147
Well, I just gotta say it once.
Everybody else gets to say it.

90
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,649
Why can't I say it?

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,678
What, you never said it?

92
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,255
Once. To a dog.

93
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,120
He licked himself and left the room.

94
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,796
Well, so it wasrt a total loss.

95
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,032
- Hey.
- Hey, I forgot to tell you.

96
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,602
I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils
playoff tonight.

97
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,296
Oh, I'm there.

98
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,605
- What about you, George?
- Can't do it, can't do it.

99
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,575
- Sorry. Got a date.
- So? So?

100
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,579
No, no, no, if you must know...

101
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,082
...I would rather be with her
than go to the game.

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,351
Well, she must be
a very special lady, huh, George?

103
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,118
- What do I do with the extra ticket?
- Oh, hey!

104
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,692
Can I bring David Puddy?

105
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,829
- He's a big Devils fan.
- Sure, fine with me.

106
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,364
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants
an inside tour of the zoo...

107
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,502
...Siena works there as a trainer.

108
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,830
- So she works at the zoo?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,996
Yeah, like Dian Fossey, huh?

110
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,735
She's the only person that's ever
been accepted into gorilla society.

111
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,106
And you know,
once those gorillas accept you...

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,078
...you got it made in the shade.

113
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,583
So how long have you been
a Devils fan?

114
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,779
- Since I was a kid. I'm from Jersey.
- Yeah?

115
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:01,416
- We're gonna kick your butts tonight.
- Ain't no way, man!

116
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,289
- Yes.
- We're primed.

117
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,430
You almost ready? Jerry and Kramer
are gonna be here any second.

118
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,867
- What the...?
- So, what do you think?

119
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,598
- What is that?
- I painted my face.

120
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,542
- You painted your face?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,606
- Why?
- Well, you know, support the team.

122
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,719
- Well, you can't walk around like that.
- Why not?

123
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,521
Because...

124
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,590
...it's insane.

125
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,626
You gotta let them know
you're out there. This is the playoffs.

126
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,435
- Hey.
- Hi.

127
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,197
Dave's...

128
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,931
...painted his face.

129
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,906
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
You gotta support your team.

130
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,409
- Okay. Ready to go?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,343
Let's get it on! All right! Go Devils!

132
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,280
Go Devils! Let's go, Devils!

133
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,857
You stink, Messier!

134
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,258
We're gonna get you, Messier!

135
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,728
Will you sit down?

136
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,924
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to support the team.

137
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,934
Will you sit down?
You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!

138
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,938
Because you're a Rangers fan and you
know I'm messing with their heads.

139
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,440
Yeah, Devils goal!

140
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,777
Devils goal! Stephane Richer
scores from just inside the blue line.

141
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,509
And the Devils...

142
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,980
Well, you know, I could've
actually gone tonight.

143
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,886
So why didn't you?

144
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,823
Well, I didn't wanna break our date.

145
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,361
Oh, well...

146
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,324
Because I...

147
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,502
I love you.

148
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,199
You know, I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.

149
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,407
We took it to you.

150
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,208
You couldn't get it out of your zone.
We were aggressive.

151
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,044
- We didn't let you penetrate.
- That's enough out of you.

152
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,188
There's still three more games
left in this series, my friend...

153
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,416
...and it's far from being over,
very far from being over.

154
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,222
Hey, what are you doing?
Watch where you're driving, man!

155
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,529
Don't mess with a Devil, buddy.
We're number one. We beat anybody.

156
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,464
We're the Devils!

157
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,399
The Devils!

158
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,076
"I'm hungry.

159
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,518
Let's get something to eat."

160
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,116
Yep.

161
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,053
- Big matzo ball.
- Huge matzo ball.

162
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,396
Those damn "I love you" returns.

163
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,127
- Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
- Oh, you don't know.

164
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,168
You know how fast
things deteriorate...

165
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,397
...when there's an "I love you"
out of the bag?

166
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,600
You can't have a relationship
where one person says, "I love you"...

167
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,110
...and the other one says, "I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat."

168
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,507
Unless you're married.

169
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,516
She thinks I'm one of
these guys that loves her.

170
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,553
Nobody wants somebody
that loves them.

171
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,850
- No. People hate that.
- You want somebody...

172
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,926
...who doesn't like you.
- Ideally.

173
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,188
I am never saying "I love you"
again unless they say it first.

174
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,264
- Matzo ball soup?
- That would be me.

175
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,672
Hey, Jerry,
you're a smart guy, right?

176
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,569
- No question about it.
- All right.

177
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,910
I was supposed to go on this
special tour with George's girlfriend.

178
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,053
- At the zoo?
- Yeah. But before I met up with her...

179
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,245
...I stopped to look
at the monkeys...

180
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,853
...when all of a sudden I am hit
in the face with a banana peel.

181
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,565
I turn and look,
and there is this monkey...

182
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,098
...really laughing it up.

183
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,361
Then someone tells me
that he did it.

184
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,097
Well, I pick up the banana peel...

185
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,709
...and I wait for that monkey
to turn around, and then l:

186
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,603
I let him have it.

187
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,270
Kramer, you threw a banana peel
at a monkey?

188
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,578
Well, he started it!

189
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,553
- It's a monkey, Kramer!
- Well, he pushed my buttons.

190
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,987
I couldn't help it, Jerry.

191
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,819
Well, I still think it's wrong.

192
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,861
All right, fine. You take
the monkey's side. Go ahead.

193
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,289
- I'm not taking anyone's side.
- I know what happened, Jerry.

194
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,464
Did you call Alec Berg and thank him
for the hockey tickets?

195
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,732
- No.
- Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?

196
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:46,139
Why am I gonna call? I thanked him
five times when he gave them to me.

197
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,371
Call him the next day.
It's common courtesy.

198
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,243
No. I'm taking a stand against
all this over-thanking.

199
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,545
Jerry, good manners
are the glue of society.

200
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,052
If I knew I had to give him
8 million thank-yous...

201
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,918
...I wouldn't have taken the tickets.

202
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,288
You know what this is gonna do?
He'll be upset because you didn't call.

203
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,053
We won't get the tickets for Friday.

204
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,289
- You're out of your mind.
- Where are you going?

205
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,899
I gotta get a suit cleaned.
I have a funeral on Friday.

206
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,729
- Who died?
- Do you remember the guy...

207
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,498
...who pretended he had cancer
so I would buy him the toupee?

208
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,270
- So he actually had it?
- No, car accident.

209
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,178
He was adjusting his toupee
while he was driving...

210
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,874
...and he lost control of the car.

211
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,013
That poor priest.

212
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,818
He was just visiting
from El Salvador.

213
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,754
Now he's gone completely loco.

214
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,564
- The one Puddy screamed at?
- Yeah.

215
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,600
He thinks he saw the devil.

216
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,537
He won't leave his room
in the church basement.

217
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,800
That's what you get for getting
mixed up with a face-painter.

218
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,934
What compels a seemingly normal
human to do something like that?

219
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,678
Gotta support the team.

220
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,889
You know, I really hate my clothes.

221
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,492
I open up my closet,
there's just nothing. Nothing.

222
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,728
I hate everything I have.
I really hate it.

223
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,743
I mean, at this point, it's...

224
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,544
It's like I can wear something
three or four times and that's it.

225
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,347
It's getting to be
a terrible problem for me.

226
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,849
Hey, Alec.

227
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,362
Did you see that?

228
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,295
What kind of a hello was that?

229
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,362
Mr. Kramer, thanks for coming.

230
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,872
So, what did you wanna
see me about?

231
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,307
Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it...

232
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,607
...we're having a bit
of a problem with Barry.

233
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,643
- Barry?
- The chimpanzee.

234
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,021
Well, what's the problem?

235
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,591
Well, he's not functioning
the way he normally does.

236
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,389
He seems depressed.
He's lost his appetite.

237
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,295
He's even curtailed
his autoerotic activities.

238
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,736
And we think this is directly related
to the altercation he had with you.

239
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,637
So? So, what do you want me to do?

240
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,643
Well, frankly...

241
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,303
...we'd like you to apologize.

242
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,340
Well, he started it.

243
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,813
Mr. Kramer,
he's an innocent primate.

244
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,978
So am I.

245
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,952
What about my feelings?
Don't my feelings count?

246
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:52,154
Only the poor monkey's important.
Everything's done for the monkey.

247
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,430
Look, I'm sorry. I...

248
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,467
Hey, that's okay.

249
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,637
Well, I gotta go feed the marmoset.

250
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,367
You know, George really likes you.

251
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,376
I don't...

252
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,378
Oh, she doesn't hear too well
out of her left ear.

253
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,810
Do you think it's possible...

254
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,387
...that he's mad at me because he
didn't get the day-after thank-you?

255
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,548
- Wait. You were at a funeral, right?
- Yeah.

256
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,593
Well, people never give
a good hello at the funeral.

257
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,992
I mean, they go like this:

258
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,126
- That's the biggest.
- That's kind of what he gave me.

259
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,704
Yeah, they can't go,
"Hey! You look fabulous!"

260
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,936
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,236
I just spoke to your girlfriend.

262
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,043
- Girlfriend. Yeah, right.
- She asked me to apologize to Barry.

263
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,741
- Barry?
- The monkey.

264
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,114
- Well?
- Nothing doing.

265
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,550
Jerry, I didn't do anything.

266
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,157
It's the monkey that should be
apologizing to me.

267
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,125
- I don't think that's gonna happen.
- Well, I'm sorry.

268
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,659
I tried to put the good word in
for you with Siena...

269
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,495
...but I don't think she heard me.
You know, left ear.

270
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,964
- What?
- Yeah, her boss told me...

271
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,664
...that she can't hear very well
out of her left ear.

272
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,070
What, you didn't know that?

273
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,139
- Oh, my God.
- What?

274
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,681
She probably never heard it.
Don't you see what this means?

275
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,342
It's like the whole thing
never happened.

276
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,015
It's like when Superman reversed the
rotation of the Earth to save Lois Lane.

277
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,291
Are you gonna say it again?

278
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,022
That's the question, Jimmy.

279
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,671
- I'm gonna do it.
- What?

280
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,814
After what you went through?
You said you'd never say it again.

281
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:54,442
I'd like to say it once to someone
that can actually hear it!

282
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,512
- Yeah!
- Hey, buddy.

283
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,618
- Boy, what's going on?
- He's gonna talk into her other ear.

284
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,628
Listen, I almost forgot to ask you.
What happened at the funeral?

285
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,059
Did you talk to Alec Berg?

286
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,425
- Yeah, I saw him.
- So he'll give you the hockey tickets?

287
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,467
Well, not exactly.

288
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,066
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.

289
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,971
- I don't know if he's mad.
- What happened when you saw him?

290
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,341
I didn't really get a good hello.
But I was at a funeral.

291
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,379
So I don't know if I got
a funeral hello...

292
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,348
...or he was mad because he didn't
get his day-after thank-you.

293
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,579
- See? I told you, Jerry! I told you!
- What do you want me to do?

294
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:35,250
I want you to get on this phone
and give him his thank-you!

295
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,657
No. No, I can't!

296
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,267
Jerry, this is the way society functions.
Arert you a part of society?

297
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,629
Because if you don't wanna be
a part of society...

298
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:49,206
...why don't you just get in your car
and move to the East Side.

299
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,536
Look, we got five hours
before the game.

300
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,874
I am betting it was a funeral hello.

301
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,280
We're here. He knows the number.
He knows we wanna go.

302
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,579
There's plenty of time
for him to call.

303
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,747
You stubborn, stupid, silly man!

304
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,959
Hey, great dip. You make this?

305
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,824
No, it's from the store.

306
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,461
Hey, how come people don't have dip
for dinner? Why is it only a snack?

307
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,703
I don't understand stuff like that.

308
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,046
David...

309
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,714
- David, I think we ought to talk.
- All right, that's cool.

310
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,717
David, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

311
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,959
You gotta be kidding. How come?

312
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,565
Well, you see, David...

313
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,794
...you're a face-painter.

314
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,771
Yeah, that's right.

315
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,942
Well, it's not that I don't like you...

316
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,841
...but, well, to be perfectly honest...

317
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:06,178
...I'm just having some trouble
getting past the face-painting.

318
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,352
So you don't like the face-painting.
I just won't paint it anymore.

319
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,023
Yeah. But you like the face-painting.

320
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,757
Well, I don't need to do it.
It's not like a habit or anything.

321
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,031
- You mean you'd stop it for me?
- Yeah, that's right.

322
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,833
That's so...

323
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,101
- That's so sweet.
- Come here.

324
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,550
I gotta go home and change before
the game. I'll be back. We'll make out.

325
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,566
Siena, I love you.

326
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,003
Yeah, I know.
I heard you the first time.

327
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,532
Yeah.

328
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,402
Just confirming.

329
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,073
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

330
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,047
No, I was expecting somebody else.

331
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,743
I'm sorry, I can't talk,
I gotta keep the line clear.

332
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,324
I know I have call waiting, but I don't
trust it in an emergency. Goodbye.

333
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,024
Anyway...

334
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,427
...I just wanna say that I'm sorry.

335
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,927
I lost my temper,
and I probably shouldn't have.

336
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,765
I took it out on you and...

337
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,534
Look, if I've caused you any problems
as a result of my behavior...

338
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,734
...well, then, I'm sorry.

339
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,880
I apologize.

340
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,375
Even though you know, Barry,
between me and you...

341
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,179
...we both know that you started it.
I mean, who's kidding who?

342
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,913
But they tell me
that you're very upset...

343
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,616
...and God forbid I should disturb
the very important monkey.

344
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,695
I hope we can put this behind us.
Let's just move on with our lives.

345
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,092
So no hard feelings?

346
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,144
- What is that?
- It's the letter D.

347
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,648
Why is the letter D
painted on your chest?

348
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,987
I'm going to the game and me and
five guys are taking our shirts off...

349
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,152
...and spell out "Devils."

350
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,458
- But you said no more painting.
- No, I said no more face-painting.

351
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,796
And as you can see,
this is not my face.

352
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,961
Yeah, that's right.

353
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,109
Well, did he call?

354
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,379
- No.
- Oh, come on, Jerry! This is stupid.

355
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:54,849
It's 6:00! It's all over!
Just pick up the phone and thank him!

356
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,949
All right.

357
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,993
Hello, Alec?

358
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,652
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

359
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,822
You know, you got a great
John Houseman name.

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,831
Alec Berg.

361
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,971
Did you hand in your assignment,
Mr. Berg?

362
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,662
What can I do for you, Jerry?

363
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,503
Well, Alec, the reason I called
is I just wanted...

364
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,542
...to thank you for the tickets.

365
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,011
I wish you'd called earlier.
I could've given you tickets for tonight.

366
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,877
- Oh, you already gave them away?
- Yeah.

367
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,042
But you know what,
I have a friend...

368
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,778
...he's got a couple of seats.

369
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,822
- You mind the nosebleed section?
- We don't care. We wanna go.

370
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,515
There is one little catch, though.

371
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,433
Hey, great game, huh?
Let's go, Devils!

372
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,135
All right, let's get it up!
Let's get it up! Come on!

373
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,110
Come on, D! D!

374
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,640
- E.
- V.

375
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,313
- I!
- L!

376
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,210
S!

377
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,814
Hello, Father.
