1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,723
It's hard to find a store in a mall.
They have a directory...

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,519
...but the problem with it is,
even if you figure out where you are...

3
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:11,247
...and where you wanna go...

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:14,446
...you still don't really know,
sometimes, which way to walk...

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:16,839
...because it's an upright map.

6
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,524
If you had, like, suction-cup feet,
then you could just walk right up on it.

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,398
Then you could tell, you could be
on it going, "All right, I'm here.

8
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:26,366
I wanna go to the Gap.
That's down there.

9
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,042
All right, I'll just walk that way."

10
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:35,244
But people would know. They would
see you walking down the mall going:

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,444
They'd go, "That's one
of those suction-cup guys.

12
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,318
I heard about that guy.
He's never lost."

13
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,488
One left. What a joke.

14
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,924
- You can have this one.
- That's not enough BTUs...

15
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,523
...for my living room.
This was a waste of time.

16
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,883
I didn't get one either.

17
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,562
Why do I always have the feeling...

18
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,243
...everybody's doing something
better than me on Saturdays?

19
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,127
- This is what people do.
- No, they don't.

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,928
They're out on some big picnic,
they're cooking burgers...

21
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,000
...making out on blankets.

22
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:06,761
They're not at some mall in Jersey...

23
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:10,285
...watching their friends trying to find
the world's cheapest air conditioner.

24
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,521
You should see what my father used
to do before he bought a new car.

25
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,522
He'd go from state to state.
He was away for weeks at a time.

26
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,408
Like he's running for president
and going through the primaries.

27
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,287
We'd get phone calls
from New Hampshire.

28
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,526
We took a little ride,
what's the big deal?

29
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,805
At least you accomplished something.
You got fish.

30
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,004
Oh, big accomplishment.

31
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:29,125
Fish. What do they do?

32
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,803
- What do you do?
- Hey, this way!

33
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,561
Jerry, what time do you have?

34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,321
I have 5:00.

35
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,481
- Always late. Always late.
- You're not late.

36
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,117
I told them to meet me
in front of my building at 6: 15.

37
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,087
- Who?
- My parents. It's their anniversary.

38
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,638
I'm taking them out to dinner
and a show tonight.

39
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,118
- Think we'll hit traffic?
- Of course. It's rush hour.

40
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,280
- Isn't it the other way?
- There's no other way.

41
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:55,041
Everybody goes every way
all the time.

42
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,087
- But it's Saturday.
- You got the picnic and burger traffic.

43
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:00,717
- There's picnic traffic?
- As my grandfather used to say:

44
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,925
"Sometimes even a picnic's
no picnic."

45
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:07,844
I always get myself in this position.
Can't be on time. Gotta rush.

46
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,361
What's the matter?

47
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:15,002
I have to go to the bathroom.

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,399
Why do they hide the bathrooms
in these malls?

49
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,203
- You want me to help you with that?
- No, I got it.

50
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,367
What do you think, Georgie boy?

51
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,246
Did I need that pointed out for me?

52
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,401
What is that gonna do for me?
How does that help me, to see her?

53
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,958
I'm trying to live my life.
Don't show me that.

54
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,926
Well, if you like her, go and talk to her.

55
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,478
Yeah, women love to get approached
in parking garages.

56
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:45,164
I'll go up and say, " Hi, how you doing?
Would you like a glass of white wine?"

57
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,287
You get within 15 feet, she'd have
her finger on the Mace button.

58
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,724
That was a guy.

59
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,244
- That was a guy?
- Where's the car?

60
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,081
Well, I thought it was here.

61
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,444
You don't know where we parked?

62
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,079
- Oh, this is great.
- Look, I thought it was Green 22.

63
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,319
I remember Orange.
I thought it was Orange.

64
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:07,364
- I didn't pay attention.
- This is just what I need.

65
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:08,962
I'm sure it's right around here.

66
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,199
Yeah, it looks familiar.
I remember the elevator.

67
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:15,203
There's elevators all over!
Everything looks the same!

68
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,122
We're like rats in some experiment.

69
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,168
It's over there. I know where it is.

70
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,529
- It's black, right?
- Well, it's dark brown.

71
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,998
In a parking lot, you write it down.
How hard is that?

72
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,522
There it is.

73
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,088
No, no.

74
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:32,126
That's a Toyota.

75
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,002
- I thought it was...
- Hey, didn't we come in over there?

76
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,204
I thought we came in over there.

77
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,767
How long can fish live
in one of these plastic bags?

78
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:47,159
I don't know. Maybe two hours.

79
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,647
You better find this car.

80
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,322
Let's try this way.

81
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,447
I really have to go to the bathroom.

82
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,887
Why don't you just go
behind one of these cars.

83
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,600
- Why? There's nobody around.
- I'll wait.

84
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,159
You hold it in like that, you can cause
a lot of damage to your bladder.

85
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,047
That's what happens to truck drivers.

86
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,120
They hold it in all the time
and eventually...

87
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,087
...it starts to come out involuntarily.
- All right.

88
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:17,319
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers
are a $600-million-a-year industry?

89
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,686
Maybe I should just go any time I get
the urge, like you, wherever I am.

90
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:24,046
There's too much urinary freedom
in this society. I'm proud to hold it in.

91
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,358
It builds character.

92
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:27,406
- Is that it?
- No.

93
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,086
Hey! Watch it!

94
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,122
Maniac.

95
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,681
You sure you don't want help
with that?

96
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:39,204
I'm gonna put it down
behind that car.

97
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,197
Worried somebody's gonna pee on it?

98
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,879
- It's Purple 23. Remember that.
- Oh, I got it.

99
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:54,837
That I'm supposed to remember.
Where the car is, that's insignificant.

100
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,240
I think they're labouring.

101
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,321
Look at this place! It's huge!

102
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,319
All right, let me say this to you:

103
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:09,801
If I am not in front of my building
at 6: 15, when my parents get there...

104
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:12,529
...they're gonna put me on
an aggravation instalment plan...

105
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,805
...that will compound, with interest,
for decades.

106
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,482
Parents never forget a foul-up.

107
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,163
I once left my jacket on a bus
when I was 14.

108
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,241
I was flying to Chicago,
last week, on a plane:

109
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,081
"Make sure you hang on
to your jacket."

110
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,648
There's no way you can call them?

111
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,607
- Yeah, I'll call them on their car phone.
- What would it take...

112
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,647
...for his parents to get a car phone?
- Hypnosis by aliens.

113
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,642
- Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
- We need a system.

114
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,037
Well, it's gotta be here.

115
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:38,439
Why are they using so many colours?

116
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:41,248
The numbers go up to 40.

117
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:43,923
Maybe it's not on this level.

118
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,759
- What?
- There's four different levels.

119
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:49,681
Maybe we're on the wrong level.

120
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,841
- How long was the escalator ride up?
- It felt like a couple of levels.

121
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,045
You should always bring
a pad and a pen.

122
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,803
I can't carry a pen.
I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.

123
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,288
I got a pen.

124
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,599
Where is the bathroom in this mall?

125
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,203
There's 600 stores,
I didn't see one bathroom.

126
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:05,768
What is this, like, a joke?

127
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:09,604
Don't they consult with a urologist
when they build one of these places?

128
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,445
- What's with you?
- My ear itches.

129
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,248
Don't you dare talk to me like that,
you hear me?

130
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,163
I told you, I don't care!
You'll have to wait!

131
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,797
Hey, hey, is that really necessary?

132
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,880
Why don't you mind
your own business.

133
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:29,280
Well, I think hitting a defenceless child
is my business.

134
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,440
- You're ugly.
- What?

135
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,406
- You're ugly.
- You are.

136
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,560
- You are.
- That's what you think.

137
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,924
That's what I know.

138
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,479
- I found it!
- He's got it!

139
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,207
- No, no, no.
- All right, that's it.

140
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,998
From now on, no more calling out
"I found it" unless we're sitting in it.

141
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,160
Jerry, look at my fish.

142
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,718
- His eyes look a little cloudy.
- See?

143
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,845
Oh, those are your eyes.

144
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,801
Oh, they are gonna be furious.

145
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,641
- Who's got the tickets?
- I do.

146
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,037
I thought you knew this mall.

147
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,359
- You said you'd been here.
- It was easy last time.

148
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,759
Okay, my fish are dying
right in front of me.

149
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:14,001
We've gotta get someone to drive us
around to us help look for the car.

150
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,603
No one's gonna do that.

151
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:18,888
Excuse me. Hi.

152
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:23,247
We can't seem to find our car. I was
wondering if it would be possible...

153
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,924
...to drive us around the garage
for five minutes so we can look.

154
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:28,727
Sorry.

155
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,562
- Just five minutes.
- Can't do it.

156
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,598
We're not skinheads.

157
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:41,640
Excuse me.
I can't seem to find my car.

158
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,243
Do you think you could drive me...?

159
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,688
Oh, that's funny? Is that funny?
Hey, tell me if you think this is funny:

160
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,841
These fish are dying.

161
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,839
In an hour they'll be belly-up!

162
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,080
Excuse me.

163
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,285
Excuse me.

164
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:05,005
Hey, sorry to have disturbed you.
Terribly sorry.

165
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,286
But the fish will be dead!
You do know that?

166
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,758
They can't live in plastic.

167
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:14,205
That's not me talking, that's science!

168
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,167
It's amazing how shopping
makes me have to go.

169
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,048
How does my bladder know
I'm in a department store?

170
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,279
Why don't you just go.

171
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,007
No, I can't.

172
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,081
- Don't you get tired of following rules?
- You think I'm too cautious?

173
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,207
Why be uncomfortable
if you don't have to?

174
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:33,281
- It's organic.
- Organic. So is Buddy Hackett.

175
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:35,679
- Buddy Hackett?
- He's a comedian.

176
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,083
I know.

177
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,005
- All right, all right.
- Hey, you can go over here.

178
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,605
I can manage.

179
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,446
George!

180
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,963
- Okay, let's go.
- But...

181
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:00,482
Come on.

182
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,765
Kramer.

183
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,326
I'm telling you, I've had this condition
since I was 11 years old.

184
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,765
I've been in and out of hospitals
my whole life.

185
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,840
I have no control over it.

186
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:17,398
Doctors have told me
that when I feel it...

187
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,525
...the best thing to do
is just release it.

188
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,281
Otherwise...

189
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:22,802
...I could die.

190
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:24,968
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

191
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,758
I'm telling you
that if I don't go, I could die.

192
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,489
Die! Is it worth dying for?

193
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:35,039
- That's up to you.
- Oh, so you don't care if I die.

194
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,679
What I care about is the sanitary
condition of the parking facility.

195
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,885
Why would I do it
unless I was in mortal danger?

196
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,085
- I know it's against the law.
- I don't know.

197
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,003
Because I could get "uromysitisis"
poisoning and die, that's why.

198
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,999
You think I enjoy living like this?

199
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,842
The shame? The humiliation?

200
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,239
You know, I've been issued
a public urination pass...

201
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,161
...by the city because of my condition.

202
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,719
Unfortunately, my little brother ran out
of the house with it this morning.

203
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,762
Him and his friends are probably
peeing all over the place.

204
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:07,887
Jerry!

205
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:11,605
Jerry!

206
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,566
Unbelievable.

207
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,845
I'm never gonna get out of here.

208
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,847
Guy goes to pee,
he never comes back.

209
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,601
It's like a science-fiction story.

210
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,520
Maybe he went
to one of the other levels.

211
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,600
- I'm gonna look for him.
- Now you're gonna go?

212
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,566
- Be back in five minutes.
- lf you go now...

213
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:30,244
...we'll find the car, Jerry will show up
and we'll never find you!

214
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,286
I'll be right back.

215
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,006
What's the difference?
We'll all be dead eventually.

216
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,879
Does that bother you?

217
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,207
Yeah, it bothers me.

218
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:45,645
- Doesn't it bother you?
- Not at all.

219
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:48,199
Now, that bothers me even more
than dying bothers me.

220
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,246
Because people like you
live to be 120...

221
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,047
...because you're not bothered by it.

222
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,927
How can it not bother you?

223
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,367
Well, I once saw this thing on TV
with people who are terminally ill.

224
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,759
Every one of them believed
that the secret of life...

225
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,601
...is just to live every moment.

226
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,521
Yeah, I've heard that.

227
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:08,682
Meanwhile, I'm here with you
in a parking garage in Jersey.

228
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,406
That's a nice jacket.
Where'd you get that?

229
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:14,641
Some guy left it
over at my mother's house.

230
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:18,518
First of all, you don't even know,
technically, that I went.

231
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,008
That's for starters.

232
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,842
I mean, I could have been pouring
a bottle of water out there.

233
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:26,447
- I know what you did.
- Oh, really? Do you? Well...

234
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,918
...it just so happens
that I did pour water out.

235
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,684
I had a bottle of very tepid water
and I poured it out.

236
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,441
I could see how you made
a mistake...

237
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:38,648
...because pouring water out sounds
very much like a person urinating.

238
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:40,845
And, you know,
when you think about it...

239
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,206
...it's really quite an amusing case
of mistaken identity.

240
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:45,961
And that's all it is.

241
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,962
And now he's gone.
I'm sure he's looking for the car.

242
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,245
Five minutes, that's all.
I just wanna find him.

243
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,048
- I can't do it.
- But why? Why can't you do it?

244
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,608
I can't.

245
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,203
That's not a reason, "You can't."
You just don't want to.

246
00:11:58,609 --> 00:11:59,928
That's right.

247
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,841
But why? Why don't you want to?

248
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,201
I don't know.

249
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,001
Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction
out of helping someone out?

250
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,763
No, I wouldn't.

251
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,285
All right. All right.

252
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,247
I... I want to apologize.

253
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,762
I was frightened.

254
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,045
I said crazy things,
I obviously offended you...

255
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,279
...I insulted your intelligence.

256
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,521
The uromysitisis, the water bottle...

257
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,407
...I made all that up.

258
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:35,764
And now I'm gonna tell you the truth.

259
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,684
Today my parents are celebrating...

260
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:43,205
...their 50th...
Well, I'm jumping ahead here.

261
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,758
Their 47th wedding anniversary.

262
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,126
And we made plans to spend
the evening together.

263
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:52,201
They're meeting me
in front of my building at 6: 15.

264
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,280
What I haven't told you...

265
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,003
...or anyone else, for that matter...

266
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,404
...is that my father's been
in a Red Chinese prison...

267
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,685
...for the past 14 years.

268
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,926
I mean, the guy had a fat fetish.

269
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,445
The inspector never dated a woman
under 250 pounds.

270
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:12,204
- Really.
- What did he do with all that fat?

271
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,325
Does he just jump up and down on it?

272
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:17,162
Or does he gouge it
like Killer Kowalski?

273
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,638
- Who's Killer Kowalski?
- He was a wrestler.

274
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,242
He would get down on his knees...

275
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,525
...and he'd grab ahold
of someone's stomach...

276
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,088
...and squeeze it till they gave.

277
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:28,286
Hey, hey, hey.
I have to go to the bathroom.

278
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,007
Why don't you just go.

279
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,165
What, here?

280
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,999
You and Jerry. It's...

281
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,962
Okay.

282
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,758
All right, I'm gonna
go down this row.

283
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,238
What? What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

284
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,799
Kramer! Kramer!

285
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:06,161
What? Don't you believe me?
It's their 47th anniversary.

286
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,041
You know, this is gonna kill them.

287
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,279
You're aware of that? Kill them.

288
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,121
On the biggest night of their life.

289
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,849
Your folks have
an anniversary today too?

290
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:20,283
Was your father also
in a Red Chinese prison?

291
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,128
Red Chinese prison?

292
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:27,207
George!

293
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,009
George!

294
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,842
Jerry!

295
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,319
Jerry!

296
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,886
You know when you're walking
with someone...

297
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,961
...and you assume
that they know where the car is?

298
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,407
And you're fine until you see them
do this move. Once they do this:

299
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,919
When they look back from
where they came from...

300
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,238
No, you're in bad shape now.

301
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,719
Nobody that knows
where they're going does that.

302
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,848
Pilots on planes don't open
the cockpit door and go:

303
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,362
Well, what happened was...

304
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,646
...my father was staying with
one of China's great military leaders...

305
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,403
...General Chang, who, by the way,
came up with the recipe...

306
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:16,720
...for General Chang's chicken. The
one with red pepper and orange peel...

307
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:19,039
...at Szechwan Gardens?
- I eat it all the time. Spicy.

308
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,200
Apparently, General Chang
is a flamboyant man.

309
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:24,247
Complete failure as a general,
but a hell of a cook.

310
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:26,928
Look at this.

311
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,523
Look at this. Will you look at this?

312
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,364
He doesn't have enough with the
Mercedes, he has to have two spaces.

313
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,566
I tell you, you know what I'd like
to do? I'd like to spit on it.

314
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,481
I would like to see that.

315
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,482
- Should I? Should I do it?
- Teach him a lesson he'll never forget.

316
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,879
- Who does he think he is?
- Someone's gotta stop him.

317
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,166
- It's against the law, isn't it?
- Well, it certainly should be.

318
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,607
Okay.

319
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,042
This is some machine.

320
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,404
Leave it to the Germans.

321
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,320
Let me ask you something.

322
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,957
What do they get
for a tune-up on this?

323
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,367
- Jerry!
- Elaine!

324
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,723
Where have you been?

325
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,323
- I was arrested for urinating.
- Me too.

326
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,719
- You what?
- I have uromysitisis.

327
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,368
It's very serious, you know.

328
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,247
Jerry, look at my fish.

329
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,318
- Is he...?
- No, but he's not looking good.

330
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,203
Please. We can't find our car.

331
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:28,805
Please, just drive us around
the parking lot to find our car.

332
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,039
- My fish are dying.
- Sorry. Can't do it.

333
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,882
I can see not caring
what happens to us. We're human.

334
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:37,325
But what about the fish? The fish?

335
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:38,808
Sorry.

336
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,727
That's right, go.

337
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,607
Go home to your dumbbells.

338
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:47,365
Go work on your pecs and your lats.
We're all really impressed.

339
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,599
Yeah, that's right. You heard me.

340
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,001
- You got a problem with that?
- Elaine, shut up.

341
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,241
Don't worry, I'm packing heat.

342
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,128
Hey, hey. Where's Kramer?

343
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,041
- I don't know.
- I thought he was with you.

344
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,120
Oh, see? See? I knew
this was gonna happen.

345
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,961
Look at the time. All right, that's it.

346
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:07,085
Did we look over there?
We check that side?

347
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,809
- We came in over there.
- We didn't come in over there.

348
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,687
- Where's Kramer?
- Look at these cars...

349
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,248
...they all look exactly alike.

350
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,806
The fumes.

351
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,288
I can't breathe.

352
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,361
I'm having trouble breathing.

353
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,009
Hey, George, there she is again.

354
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,761
What are you doing?
You're killing me.

355
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:35,724
Ask her to drive us around.
There's your opening.

356
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:40,405
That is an opening.

357
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,281
Excuse me. I'm really...

358
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,041
See, what happened...

359
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:50,804
...my friend forgot where he parked...
- Sure, I'll drive you around.

360
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,682
- You will?
- Sure.

361
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,438
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:58,124
We're late and my parents are waiting
for me and we're stuck here.

363
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,167
Well, I wouldn't wanna get lost in here.
It smells like a toilet.

364
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,638
- People are such animals.
- You're telling me.

365
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:05,128
Filthy pigs.

366
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,640
It's a brown Ford.

367
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,323
This has happened to me too.
It's very frustrating.

368
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,001
I've asked several people.
They wouldn't even answer me.

369
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,558
I'm happy to do it.

370
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:18,923
I'm Michele.

371
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:22,845
Hi, Michele. I'm George.

372
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,279
- Get out!
- But I didn't mean anything by it.

373
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:40,045
I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard.
I didn't know you were with that group.

374
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:41,961
What about my fish?

375
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:45,087
Boy, those Scientologists,
they can be pretty sensitive.

376
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,967
I'll say.

377
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,848
What is it? The car!

378
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,806
- The car!
- The car!

379
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:56,247
- The car!
- I can't believe it!

380
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:59,879
Kramer. Kramer's not here.
I knew it.

381
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,687
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

382
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,966
- Kramer! Kramer!
- Kramer!

383
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,043
Kramer!

384
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,361
Hey, look.

385
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:19,077
Boy, I had a hell of a time finding
that air conditioner.

386
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:20,762
You know I looked everywhere?

387
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,727
I completely forgot where I hid it.

388
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,481
You know where it was?

389
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:29,358
- Purple 23.
- Right. Purple 23.

390
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,087
I could have used you.

391
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:33,683
Sometimes it's good to write
those things down.

392
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,522
Oh, boy. What time is it?

393
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,327
7:45.

394
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,517
Well, at least there'll be no traffic.

395
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:44,842
Right.

396
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:47,561
Oh, boy.

397
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,759
- What time does that play start?
- 8:00.

398
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,648
Well, that could be a problem.

399
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:59,084
Where's your little bag of...

400
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:03,643
All right, let's giddyup.

401
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,319
See, the problem
with the mall garage...

402
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,879
...is that everything looks the same.

403
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,080
They try to differentiate it.

404
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:36,286
They put up different colours,
different numbers, different letters.

405
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:38,440
What they need to do
is name the levels like:

406
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,645
"Your mother's a whore."
You know what I mean?

407
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,367
You would remember that.

408
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,487
You'd go, " I know, I'm parked at
'My father's an abusive alcoholic.'

409
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,526
I know where I parked."

410

00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,403
There's always one location
in your neighbourhood, one store...

412
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:43,873
...that's constantly changing hands.

413
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:46,598
Everybody has this in their
neighbourhood. It's a leather store...

414
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,880
...then it's a yoghurt shop,
it's a pet supply.

415
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:51,399
It's constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.

416
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:53,873
It's like some sort of
Bermuda Triangle of retail.

417
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:58,117
Stores open up and then
they just disappear without a trace.

418
00:21:58,284 --> 00:21:59,683
Nobody knows what happened.

419
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:03,962
Eventually, when aliens land and the
mothership from Close Encounters...

420
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:07,713
The bottom will slowly open and all
these store owners will wander out...

421
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:11,718
...in a daze, going, " I thought there
was gonna be more walk-in traffic."

422
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:15,513
She thinks I'm nice.

423
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:19,163
- Women don't want nice.
- Amazing.

424
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:22,077
I haven't seen one person go in
that restaurant since it opened.

425
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:25,282
- Poor guy.
- Why is nice bad?

426
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,481
What kind of a sick society are
we living in when nice is bad?

427
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:30,362
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?

428
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,276
What? A little cologne.

429
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:33,679
Manly.

430
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:36,159
- Monica wants me to wear it.
- Why didn't you say no?

431
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:37,552
I'm too nice.

432
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,796
Look at this poor guy. His family's
probably back in Pakistan waiting...

433
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:42,397
...for him to send back money.

434
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:44,475
This is horrible.

435
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:45,918
She wants me to take an IQ test.

436
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,552
It's because you're stupid enough
to wear the cologne.

437
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:52,633
No. She's taking this course
in education for her master's.

438
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,637
It's part of her research project,
so I have to be a guinea pig.

439
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:58,637
I've never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady...

440
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:00,763
I can't talk to you anymore.

441
00:23:00,924 --> 00:23:03,358
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
You're taking the IQ test.

442
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:05,116
She's gonna find out I'm a moron.

443
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:08,237
People think I'm smart,
but I'm not smart.

444
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:10,235
Who thinks you're smart?

445
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:11,996
I won't break 100 on this thing.

446
00:23:12,164 --> 00:23:14,724
- What thing?
- You don't listen anymore.

447
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:16,715
Oh, the IQ thing. Yeah.

448
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,195
I'm sure I have a low IQ.

449
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,400
I've been lying about my SAT scores
for 15 years.

450
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:24,556
- What did you get?
- What did I get, or what do I say I got?

451
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:26,999
- What do you say?
- I say 1409.

452
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:29,274
- 1409, that's a good score.
- You're telling me.

453
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,036
What did you really get?

454
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,643
- You're my friend.
- Of course.

455
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:34,556
- I tell you everything, right?
- I hope so.

456
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:37,636
Well, this I take to the grave.

457
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:40,524
He's serving Mexican,
Italian, Chinese.

458
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:43,193
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.

459
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:45,241
Why do you keep watching?

460
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,520
I don't know. I'm obsessed with it.

461
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:52,562
It's like a spider in the toilet,
struggling for survival.

462
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:54,876
And even though you know
he's not gonna make it...

463
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:56,955
...you root for him for a second.

464
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:58,557
Then you flush.

465
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,920
Well, it's a spider.

466
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:04,916
Sometimes people
won't go in a place...

467
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:07,518
...if they don't see anyone else
in there.

468
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:12,041
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't
do that. That is so annoying.

469
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:13,678
Bazooka Joe.

470
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,960
- The buzzer?
- It's your house.

471
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:27,994
My house. You gotta be on the lease
to press the buzzer.

472
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:30,443
- Yeah?
- It's George.

473
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,003
Come on up.

474
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:34,837
- Casus belli.
- What's that?

475
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:38,553
It's Latin. I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.

476
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:39,998
Come on, go in.

477
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:42,116
Go in.

478
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:45,677
- Have you gone in there?
- No. I'm afraid we'll start talking...

479
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:48,153
...and I'll wind up going partners
with him.

480
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:50,403
Hey.

481
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:59,476
I could probably shoot him from here.
I'd be doing us both a favour.

482
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:06,042
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?

483
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,161
Sure. Fine.

484
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,401
Casus belli.

485
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,992
Casus belli.

486
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:17,237
- What's that?
- Since when do you wear cologne?

487
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:18,996
Why is what I do so important?

488
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,314
Why must I always be the focal point
of attention?

489
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,315
Let me just be. Let me live.

490
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,316
- How'd you do on that IQ test?
- I didn't take it yet.

491
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,122
- What IQ test?
- What's casus belli?

492
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:33,435
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Is it about me?

493
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,799
Why must you always be
the focal point of attention?

494
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:38,717
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?

495
00:25:40,324 --> 00:25:44,476
It's just a Latin phrase. It does not
mean anything. Now, what is this test?

496
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:47,761
This woman he's dating is making him
take this IQ test for this course.

497
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:50,074
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Yeah, fun.

498
00:25:50,764 --> 00:25:54,234
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.

499
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:57,237
- You'll do well. You're smart.
- No, see, he's not smart.

500
00:25:57,404 --> 00:26:00,635
People think he's smart,
but he's not.

501
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:02,601
What did you get on your SATs?

502
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:04,916
It varies.

503
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:10,077
- I don't even know my IQ.
- Mine's 145.

504
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:13,443
- One forty-five!
- Get out of here.

505
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,834
- You get out of here.
- You get out of here.

506
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:19,275
Maybe you should take the test for me.

507
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,516
That would be something,
cheating on an IQ test.

508
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:25,079
Remember in college when you
passed Lettick the test...

509
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,472
...out the window?

510
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:29,761
- You became a legend after that.
- Yeah.

511
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:32,643
Yeah, I really had some guts
back then.

512
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:36,644
- Why don't we do it again?
- What?

513
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,396
You could take the IQ test for me.

514
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,397
I'll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.

515
00:26:41,564 --> 00:26:42,883
- You serious?
- Why not?

516
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,875
Where would I take the test?

517
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:47,842
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

518
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:50,040
- No, too noisy.
- Take it at the Dream Café.

519
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,398
You won't hear a peep.

520
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:56,399
- Hey, what do you think?
- Hey, I love a good caper.

521
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:02,076
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.

522
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:03,723
You'll do it?

523
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:07,204
- What the hey.
- Yeah! Beautiful!

524
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,275
Sorry.

525
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:19,599
- Welcome to the Dream Café.
- Well, I've been looking forward to it.

526
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,914
How did you hear about us?

527
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:23,995
People. People are talking.

528
00:27:26,084 --> 00:27:28,962
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.

529
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:31,194
- Nonsmoking would be great.
- Very good.

530
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:35,039
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.

531
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:37,918
A steaming hot, folded face cloth
for your pleasure.

532
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:40,962
- Thank you.
- Our specials are tacos...

533
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:43,160
...moussaka and franks and beans.

534
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:47,202
Well, what do you recommend,
my good fellow?

535
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:50,203
- The turkey.
- Well, the turkey it'll be.

536
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:52,924
May I say you have a splendid
establishment here, my friend.

537
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:56,076
I'm sure you'll flourish at this location
for many, many years.

538
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:58,394
You're a very kind man.
Very kind. Thank you.

539
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:00,483
Very kind.

540
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:04,641
Very kind. I am a kind man.

541
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:07,677
Who else would do something
lik e this? Nobody.

542
00:28:07,964 --> 00:28:10,159
Nobody thinks about people
the way I do.

543
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:12,003
Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.

544
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:14,553
You're eating a turk ey sandwich.
You want a Nobel Prize?

545
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:17,193
You go in the living room,
I'll take the test in here.

546
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:18,558
But why?

547
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:21,279
I won't be able to concentrate
in front of you.

548
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:25,278
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.

549
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:26,763
Are you kidding me?

550
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:31,518
This is the best tool we have today
of measuring a person's intelligence.

551
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,244
Well, I certainly don't place
any importance on it.

552
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:36,474
Well, I think you're wrong about that.

553
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:41,598
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd really like to get started, please.

554
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,803
- Good luck.
- Don't need it.

555
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:50,154
What's going on?
I've been here 20 minutes.

556
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm sorry. Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.

557
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:55,357
- What time do you want me back?
- Twenty to 3.

558
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:56,838
- Okay.
- Thanks again.

559
00:28:57,164 --> 00:29:00,281
And don't settle for 145.
You can do better. You're a genius.

560
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,200
Thank you, Babu.

561
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:14,157
You have quite a flair. You are
quite the restaurateur, I must say.

562
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:17,037
- It is indeed my pleasure.
- Oh, please.

563
00:29:18,084 --> 00:29:20,882
Welcome to the Dream Café.

564
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:24,874
- Our specials today...
- Oh, no, no. I'll just have tea and toast.

565
00:29:26,204 --> 00:29:29,037
- Tea and toast.
- Eat something! Babu.

566
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:31,678
Okay.

567
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,882
Well, I'll have the rigatoni.

568
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:38,514
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.

569
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:42,516
So you got the test. You're cheating.

570
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:44,916
I know.

571
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:47,479
- Hey.
- Hey.

572
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,762
Oh, boy.

573
00:29:53,804 --> 00:29:55,522
Jerry, let me ask you something.

574
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:57,402
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hey.

575
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:01,432
This guy leaves this jacket
at my mother's house two years ago.

576
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:05,996
She hasn't spoken to him since and
now he says he wants the jacket back.

577
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:09,037
- So?
- Well, I'm not giving it back.

578
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:10,679
Why not?

579
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:14,473
Because I meet a lot of women in
this jacket. They're attracted to it.

580
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:16,953
Why do you think my mother
went out with him?

581
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:21,602
- You all right?
- Yeah. Okay.

582
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:23,595
What?

583
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:30,920
Anyway, it's been two years.

584
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:33,923
I mean, isn't there, like, a statue
of limitations on that?

585
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:35,677
Statute.

586
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,758
- What?
- Statute of limitations.

587
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,801
It's not a statue.

588
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:42,798
No, it's statue.

589
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:46,078
Fine. It's a sculpture of limitations.

590
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:50,120
Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
Elaine. Elaine.

591
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:54,318
Now, you're smart. Is it "statue"
or "statute" of limitations?

592
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:58,113
- Statute.
- Oh, I really think you're wrong.

593
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:02,398
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.

594
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:04,962
What test?

595
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:09,200
- An IQ test.
- Why are you taking an IQ test?

596
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,514
- It's for George.
- George?

597
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:14,314
Look, can I explain it to you later?

598
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:16,475
But why are you taking
an IQ test for George?

599
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:17,918
Would you please?!

600
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:20,922
- Is it for a job or something?
- Later!

601
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:26,961
- You're positive it's statute?
- Yes! Yes!

602
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:29,918
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth...

603
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:44,157
- George?
- Yeah?

604
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,555
The door's locked.

605
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,316
Oh, it's locked?

606
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:50,840
I need to get something.

607
00:31:51,204 --> 00:31:54,355
Monica, I'm really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.

608
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:57,284
- George!
- Wish I could.

609
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:08,243
Babu!

610
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:10,952
If you don't mind...
Okay.

611
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:14,833
- I'll get this.
- Oh, my God! It's all over the test!

612
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:18,553
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, man!

613
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:21,238
- I'm out of time, anyway.
- Please forgive me. Please.

614
00:32:21,404 --> 00:32:23,201
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.

615
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:26,075
Please, I'm very sorry.

616
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:28,521
Tell your friends.

617
00:32:37,764 --> 00:32:40,232
It's all right.
She was cheating anyway.

618
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,520
You're a very kind man.

619
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:45,443
Babu...

620
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,918
- You're Pakistani, right?
- Yes, Pakistani. Yes.

621
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:53,072
Babu, may I say something?

622
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:55,519
Of course. You're very smart man.
I listen.

623
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:59,836
I am not a restaurateur by any means,
but it occurred to me that perhaps...

624
00:33:00,004 --> 00:33:02,837
...you might serve some dishes
from your native Pakistan...

625
00:33:03,004 --> 00:33:05,916
...as opposed to, say,
the franks and beans, for example.

626
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:09,032
- There are no Pakistani people here.
- It doesn't matter.

627
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:12,321
You would have the only authentic
Pakistani restaurant...

628
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:13,917
...in the whole neighbourhood.

629
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,316
Yes.

630
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:19,801
You see everything, don't you?

631
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:24,158
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.

632
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:30,157
I close down today. And when I open
again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.

633
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:34,193
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.

634
00:33:34,364 --> 00:33:35,843
Very special.

635
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:39,875
I am such a great guy.

636
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:42,718
Who else would've gone to the
trouble to help this immigrant?

637
00:33:42,964 --> 00:33:46,400
I am special. My mother was right.

638
00:33:46,564 --> 00:33:51,001
Of course, I've never had
Pakistani food. How bad could it be?

639
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:59,277
- It was an accident.
- What, did you go on a picnic?

640
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:01,879
Babu Bhatt did it.

641
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,040
Babu Bhatt?

642
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:09,602
- How am I going to explain this?
- Time's up, George.

643
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:12,915
Okay.

644
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:20,478
- Here you go.
- How did you do?

645
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,602
- Piece of cake.
- What happened to the test?

646
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:26,403
What? Oh, I spilled some food on it.

647
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:30,320
Food? What food?

648
00:34:30,724 --> 00:34:31,998
What are you talking about?

649
00:34:32,644 --> 00:34:33,872
Where did you get food?

650
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:36,399
- From my pocket.
- Your pocket?

651
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,878
I had a sandwich in my pocket.

652
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:45,082
- And coffee?
- Yeah. Had some coffee, yeah.

653
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:49,919
- Where did you get the coffee?
- Where did I get the coffee?

654
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,723
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.

655
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,035
- How did you get there?
- I walked.

656
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,158
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.

657
00:34:58,324 --> 00:35:01,839
- I climbed out the window.
- You climbed out the window?

658
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:04,643
- Of course.
- Why didn't you go out the door?

659
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:06,602
The door?

660
00:35:08,244 --> 00:35:11,839
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.

661
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:17,203
You're a fascinating man,
George Costanza.

662
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:22,958
The average person sees a situation
like this...

663
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:24,963
...they walk right by it.

664
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:28,762
- Not me.
- You're very special.

665
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,232
Hey, do me a favour.

666
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:35,601
Some guy comes looking for me,
tell him you don't know where I am.

667
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:37,755
Of course. I always do.

668
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:41,594
No, no, it's that guy. He's really
been bugging me about the jacket.

669
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,232
- Just give it back to him.
- He'll have to kill me.

670
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:52,801
- Hey, Georgie!
- I'm coming up.

671
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,438
How did you do on the IQ test?

672
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:57,276
Eighty-five!

673
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:05,201
- What?
- Eighty-five, Jerry! 85 IQ.

674
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:08,717
Eighty-five?

675
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:11,637
Well, well, well...

676
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:13,883
He's coming up?

677
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,597
Well, I'm no genius...

678
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:20,434
...but according to my calculations,
he should be here in a few seconds.

679
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:23,992
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.

680
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:26,394
Well, maybe the test
was gender-biased.

681
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:29,397
You know, a lot of questions
on hunting and testicles.

682
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:38,357
Oh, hello, professor.

683
00:36:41,604 --> 00:36:44,072
- George, I cannot believe...
- Please.

684
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:48,482
- No, there's gotta be a mistake.
- You should have seen her face.

685
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:50,442
It was the same look
my father gave me...

686
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:53,323
...when I told him I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

687
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:57,837
But an 85?

688
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:00,120
Listen, there were too many
distractions there.

689
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:05,278
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.

690
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:08,038
It was a madhouse.

691
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,401
Jerry, it was.

692
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,953
- Let me take it again.
- Forget it.

693
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:16,082
Oh, come on. Come on.
I'll guarantee you 140.

694
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:18,235
- What do you have to lose?
- You could do worse!

695
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:21,362
No. No, come on. I guarantee it.

696
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:25,759
- All right, I'll ask her.
- Okay. Now, where am I gonna take it?

697
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:29,758
Take it here. I'll leave.
There will be no distractions.

698
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:39,920
Well, congratulations, my friend.

699
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,355
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.

700
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:45,754
You see how I listen?

701
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,763
I work very hard, borrow more money.

702
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:52,958
I think it's fantastic. It has
a certain indefinable charm.

703
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:58,041
- You wish to eat?
- Let me tell you something, Babu.

704
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:01,594
You go back in that kitchen,
tell your chef I want the works.

705
00:38:01,924 --> 00:38:03,642
Very good.

706
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:08,243
Very good?

707
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:09,917
No, not very good...

708
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:11,517
...very great.

709
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:14,756
I am very, very great.

710
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:28,922
The IQ tests always have that
sample question at the beginning...

711
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:31,439
...where they show you how
to fill in the circle.

712
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,799
This should be the first
elimination point right there.

713
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,443
Anybody goes outside that circle:

714
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:39,801
"You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done. Your test is over.

715
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:42,524
You went outside the circle, okay?"

716
00:38:54,444 --> 00:38:57,720
- What are you doing?
- Quiet. Don't say anything.

717
00:38:57,884 --> 00:39:01,559
- What's going on?
- Hey, Kramer! I saw you go in there!

718
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:04,318
I'm not leaving till you
give me that jacket!

719
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:07,363
- Open up, Kramer!
- What did you come in here for?

720
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:10,402
Well, I thought I'd throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.

721
00:39:11,204 --> 00:39:14,241
Look, Kramer, I have to return
this test. I've gotta get out of here.

722
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:17,517
- I thought you took the test.
- I had to take it again.

723
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,993
- How come?
- What's the difference?!

724
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,042
- Well, you can't leave now.
- What?

725
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:24,593
Come on, Kramer,
I want that jacket back!

726
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:27,121
Never!

727
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:32,234
Come on, George, open up.

728
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:42,922
- Well?
- How you doing?

729
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:46,282
Where's the test?

730
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:48,953
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

731
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:52,082
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee...

732
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:00,157
Babu...

733
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:02,797
Babu.

734
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:08,277
Babu...

735
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:13,837
...you know, I've gotta tell you,
I never do this, but the shrimp...

736
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:15,803
...it's just a little stringy.

737
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,758
- You have any chicken?
- The shrimp is stringy?

738
00:40:19,924 --> 00:40:22,199
- Well, maybe you refrigerated...
- Quiet!

739
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:25,036
- No, l...
- You shut up!

740
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:28,355
You make me change restaurant,
but nobody come!

741
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:32,403
You say make Pakistani. Babu Bhatt
have only Pakistani restaurant.

742
00:40:32,884 --> 00:40:36,593
But where are people? You see
people? Show me people!

743
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:38,322
There are no people!

744
00:40:39,324 --> 00:40:41,599
- I think I'll just take the check.
- You bad man!

745
00:40:41,764 --> 00:40:43,994
You very, very bad man.

746
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:49,438
Bad man? Could my mother
have been wrong?

747
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,035
Are you looking for George?

748
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:03,036
Well...

749
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:05,082
Kind of.

750
00:41:05,884 --> 00:41:07,522
George left.

751
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:11,559
Is that the test?

752
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,001
This?

753
00:41:15,964 --> 00:41:17,636
Yeah.

754
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:20,555
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

755
00:41:22,404 --> 00:41:24,964
I hope you do a lot better this time.

756
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:29,597
Actually, I think I did.

757
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:34,554
The first time,
I couldn't really concentrate.

758
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:44,278
You know what it was?
Bad location.

759
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:47,675
Come on, let's not stand here
too long. We might run into her.

760
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:50,193
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

761
00:41:50,764 --> 00:41:54,393
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm going upstairs.

762
00:41:55,884 --> 00:42:00,196
Hey, guys. I just ran into Monica.
You know what my IQ is?

763
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,363
One fifty-one.

764
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:05,754
- One fifty-one?
- Yeah.

765
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,037
That's a good score.

766
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:11,235
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

767
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,679
- Italian.
- No, Chinese.

768
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:15,961
You know what would be great?

769
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:32,319
It's tough to do a good deed. Let's look
at your professional good-deed doers:

770
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:34,554
Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen...

771
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:37,796
...your Batmen, your Spider-Men,
your Elastic Men.

772
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:41,914
They're all wearing disguises. Masks
over their faces, secret identities.

773
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:46,521
Don't want people to know
who they are. Too much aggravation.

774
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:48,916
"Superman,
thanks for saving my life...

775
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:51,723
...but did you have
to come through my wall?

776
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:57,039
I'm renting here. They got a security
deposit. What am I supposed to do?"

777
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:07,435

778
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:13,179
The transplant, the hair plug...

779
00:43:14,703 --> 00:43:17,854
...is really quite amazing.
Hair on your shower soap yesterday...

780
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:20,014
...can be in your head tomorrow.

781
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:21,502
How do they do the transplant?

782
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:23,858
Did they have the guy take
a shower, get his soap...

783
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:25,376
...rush it in by helicopter?

784
00:43:25,543 --> 00:43:28,580
You know, keep the soap alive
on the soap-support system?

785
00:43:29,303 --> 00:43:30,941
Then eventually move it over?

786
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:34,095
"We got the hairs,
but I think we lost the Zest."

787
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:36,932
Sometimes the body
rejects the transplant...

788
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:39,981
...with organs. Is it possible
that a head could reject...

789
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:41,542
...a hair transplant?

790
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,661
The guy's just standing
around. Suddenly:

791
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:49,772
It lands in someone's
frozen yoghurt.

792
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:56,452
You see, the gaskets
that you have here...

793
00:43:56,623 --> 00:43:58,261
...are asymmetrical.

794
00:43:58,423 --> 00:44:01,142
- Really?
- So I took off the motor relay...

795
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:05,455
...on the compressor because
you've got some discoloration.

796
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:07,853
- Oh, whatever you have to do.
- I was working...

797
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:09,615
...with one mount at a time.

798
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,819
You know, because
you don't want to disturb...

799
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,373
...the position of the compressor.
- No, you don't.

800
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,897
Hey, what are you listening to?

801
00:44:20,063 --> 00:44:21,257
My show from last night.

802
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:24,062
- Oh, you taped it?
- Yeah, I was doing some new material.

803
00:44:24,223 --> 00:44:26,418
Did you ever do that thing
on the toes that I said?

804
00:44:27,463 --> 00:44:30,739
You know, how, like, the big toe
is, like, the captain of the toes.

805
00:44:30,903 --> 00:44:33,622
But sometimes the toe
next to the big toe gets so big...

806
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:35,535
...that there's, like,
a power struggle.

807
00:44:35,703 --> 00:44:37,773
And the second toe assumes
control of the foot.

808
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:40,013
- The coup d'é-toe.
- Yeah.

809
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:42,382
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

810
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:44,022
- So?
- Nothing.

811
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:46,302
Nothing at all.

812
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,976
- I need the phone.
- Who you calling?

813
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,542
China.

814
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:51,822
- China?
- Yeah, I'll pay for it.

815
00:44:51,983 --> 00:44:53,541
- What for?
- What for?

816
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:56,092
I'll tell you what for.
For hair.

817
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:59,218
- Hair?
- The Chinese have done it, my friend.

818
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:01,938
- The Chinese have done it.
- Done what?

819
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:04,901
- Discovered the cure for baldness.
- Did you see that last night?

820
00:45:05,063 --> 00:45:08,055
It was on CNN. This
Chinese doctor, Zang Zhao...

821
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,576
...has cured baldness.

822
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:12,018
- What's this?
- Oh, I just got it.

823
00:45:12,183 --> 00:45:13,775
Spector gave it to me.

824
00:45:13,943 --> 00:45:15,695
He's giving everything away.

825
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:18,297
He's becoming a minimalist.

826
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,662
Is that the guy
who likes fat women?

827
00:45:20,823 --> 00:45:22,176
Yeah.

828
00:45:22,343 --> 00:45:25,892
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict
with the minimalism?

829
00:45:27,783 --> 00:45:31,298
You. You should have watched
that report on CNN last night.

830
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:33,613
I did. I'm trying to call China.

831
00:45:33,783 --> 00:45:35,455
You can't call China now.

832
00:45:35,623 --> 00:45:37,932
It's like, what, 3:00
in the morning there.

833
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,173
- Oh, my God.
- What?

834
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:43,452
Oh, God.

835
00:45:44,623 --> 00:45:46,056
Man.

836
00:45:47,183 --> 00:45:49,174
Oh, brother.

837
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:52,339
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

838
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,573
This woman's talking to me
on my tape recorder...

839
00:45:54,743 --> 00:45:55,892
...while I was on stage.

840
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,061
This is wild.

841
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:00,179
I never heard
anything like this. Listen.

842
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:03,380
I want to slide my tongue
around you lik e a s...

843
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:07,136
Oh, my God.

844
00:46:07,303 --> 00:46:09,259
- Let me hear.
- Wait, wait, wait.

845
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,813
- Who is this woman?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

846
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:14,701
I was just listening,
and she came on.

847
00:46:14,863 --> 00:46:17,172
This is like a Penthouse letter.

848
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:19,980
- Why can't I meet women like this?
- Come on.

849
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:21,974
Wait! Wait!

850
00:46:23,383 --> 00:46:26,102
- Where was the tape recorder?
- Back of the room, on the ledge.

851
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:28,299
She must have been sitting
right in front of it.

852
00:46:28,463 --> 00:46:30,101
- My God.
- All right, come on.

853
00:46:30,263 --> 00:46:32,493
- It's my turn.
- All right. All right. All right.

854
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:35,382
- How you gonna find out who this is?
- Good question.

855
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,181
Where's the volume?

856
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,101
What do the Chinese
have to gain...

857
00:46:42,263 --> 00:46:44,572
...by faking a cure
for baldness?

858
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:47,211
If it was real, they'd never
let it out of the country.

859
00:46:47,383 --> 00:46:48,577
Imagine no baldness.

860
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:50,779
It would be like
a nation of supermen.

861
00:46:51,303 --> 00:46:52,622
- Hi, boys.
- Hello.

862
00:46:52,783 --> 00:46:54,899
- Hello.
- What's happening?

863
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,213
Tell her.
I want to hear her reaction.

864
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:00,577
This woman left this sexy
message on Jerry's tape...

865
00:47:00,743 --> 00:47:02,222
Not that, you idiot!

866
00:47:02,383 --> 00:47:04,419
- What?
- The Chinese!

867
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,096
The Chinese bald cure!

868
00:47:06,263 --> 00:47:08,731
- Oh, I thought you meant that...
- No, I meant the bald cure.

869
00:47:08,903 --> 00:47:10,734
We were talking
about the bald cure!

870
00:47:10,903 --> 00:47:12,052
What did she say?

871
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,262
Seinfeld.

872
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,456
Hey, is that Beder?

873
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:18,261
I can't believe it.

874
00:47:18,423 --> 00:47:20,334
Get me a cup of decaf.

875
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:22,774
So did you hear this message?

876
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:25,252
Man, it was unbelievable.

877
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,701
- Really?
- I can't get over it.

878
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:30,216
Sexy?

879
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:32,817
This woman drove us
out of our minds.

880
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,053
Like, how did she sound?

881
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:38,818
She had this throaty,
sexy kind of whisper.

882
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,942
Really? Like...
Like:

883
00:47:42,983 --> 00:47:44,177
Jerry...

884
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:47,938
...I want to slide my tongue
around you like a snake.

885
00:47:59,903 --> 00:48:02,258
Oh, my God.

886
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:04,302
You?

887
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:06,419
You?

888
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:08,974
That was you!

889
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:11,213
- How did you...?
- I stopped in the club to see him.

890
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:13,294
I was standing in the back
while he was on.

891
00:48:13,463 --> 00:48:15,693
There was this tape
recorder there.

892
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:17,501
And I got this impulse.

893
00:48:22,823 --> 00:48:24,939
- What?
- No, nothing. Nothing.

894
00:48:26,463 --> 00:48:28,340
Now listen, promise me
you won't tell him.

895
00:48:28,503 --> 00:48:30,095
I want to have
a little fun with this.

896
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:33,540
I had no idea you
were filled with such...

897
00:48:34,103 --> 00:48:36,173
...sexuality.

898
00:48:37,983 --> 00:48:39,211
Oh, that was nothing.

899
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,975
So listen,
what about this bald thing?

900
00:48:41,143 --> 00:48:44,340
Some bald thing, a bald thing.
I don't know. It's nothing.

901
00:48:45,303 --> 00:48:46,736
- Remember Beder?
- Beder?

902
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:48,222
Yeah, you remember Beder.

903
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,453
I told you he went
to the track that one time...

904
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:52,181
...and he was yelling
at this jockey.

905
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,574
And the jockey got off the horse
and started chasing him.

906
00:48:56,263 --> 00:48:59,460
So listen. What about this girl
on your tape recorder?

907
00:48:59,623 --> 00:49:01,420
Oh, Elaine.

908
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:07,375
What do you think an enraptured
female fan of mine might say?

909
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:09,341
I don't know.

910
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:12,813
She went on in some detail
about certain activities...

911
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,895
...illegal in some states,
for consenting adults.

912
00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:18,099
Things you would
know very little about.

913
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:20,333
- Oh, really?
- Well...

914
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:22,653
...this type of thing
is very common...

915
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:24,973
...when you're in show business.

916
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:27,376
So, what?
You gonna ask her out?

917
00:49:27,543 --> 00:49:29,295
No, she didn't leave
her name or number.

918
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:31,419
Bummer. Okay.

919
00:49:31,743 --> 00:49:33,620
Good luck finding her.
I'm taking off.

920
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:36,013
- Where are you going?
- Home.

921
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:37,617
What are you going home for?

922
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:40,338
I just came from the gym...

923
00:49:40,503 --> 00:49:42,937
- Unless I can shower at your place.
- Sure.

924
00:49:49,183 --> 00:49:50,502
Oh, my God.

925
00:49:52,983 --> 00:49:54,735
Oh, man.

926
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:56,097
I don't get it.

927
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:59,380
Why would a woman do that and then
leave no way to get in touch with her?

928
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,340
Maybe she realized
she couldn't have you...

929
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:04,176
...and jumped off the
George Washington Bridge.

930
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:06,296
Yes. Operator.

931
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,021
Beijing.

932
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:12,341
- Why are you doing this?
- Why do I do anything?

933
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:13,902
For women.

934
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:16,019
Elaine, have you ever
gone out with a bald man?

935
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:18,378
- No.
- Know what that makes you? A baldist.

936
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:21,215
Oh, this I need.

937
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:24,898
Hello, is this
the hair restoration clinic?

938
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,213
Yeah, yeah.
Does anyone speak English?

939
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:29,135
You're taping.

940
00:50:29,303 --> 00:50:31,373
Just be yourselves.

941
00:50:31,543 --> 00:50:33,773
Oh, okay.

942
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:36,980
Well, we're talking
with Elaine Benes...

943
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:38,895
...adult film star...

944
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:42,022
...on the set
of her new picture...

945
00:50:42,183 --> 00:50:44,492
...Elaine Does
the Upper West Side.

946
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,892
Hi, how you doing?

947
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:51,452
Well, I'm doing fine.

948
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:54,091
Do you speak English?
English!

949
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:56,254
Oh, here's the director,
Jerry Seinfeld.

950
00:50:56,423 --> 00:50:58,414
Jerry, you discovered
Elaine Benes.

951
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:00,096
Well, yes I did. That's true.

952
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:03,539
Couple of guys I knew
in the Coast Guard told me about her.

953
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:09,137
And I sensed that she had
the anger and intensity...

954
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:12,136
...that I needed
to make this film work.

955
00:51:12,743 --> 00:51:14,096
English!

956
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,097
Does anybody speak English?

957
00:51:16,263 --> 00:51:17,457
Nobody speaks English.

958
00:51:17,623 --> 00:51:20,342
So, what scene are you getting
ready to shoot now, Elaine?

959
00:51:20,503 --> 00:51:23,654
In this scene, my co-star,
who's right over here...

960
00:51:23,823 --> 00:51:26,576
Follow me.
Is George Costanza.

961
00:51:26,743 --> 00:51:28,813
And he plays an airline pilot...

962
00:51:28,983 --> 00:51:30,416
...who's just returned
from Rome.

963
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:33,939
And I'm about to show him
how much I've missed him.

964
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:36,820
That's my Chinese food.

965
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,818
So, George, is this your
first movie with Elaine?

966
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:43,582
I don't know.

967
00:51:45,623 --> 00:51:49,536
So, Elaine, in your movies,
is the sex real, or is it simulated?

968
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:51,853
Oh, it's always simulated...

969
00:51:52,023 --> 00:51:53,502
...except with George.

970
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:55,540
That's in my contract.

971
00:51:55,703 --> 00:51:57,136
All right, Kramer.
That's enough.

972
00:51:57,303 --> 00:51:59,373
That's enough. Yeah, hello?

973
00:51:59,543 --> 00:52:00,737
Yeah, hello?

974
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:02,177
English!

975
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:03,856
Does anyone speak English?

976
00:52:04,023 --> 00:52:05,536
- How much do I owe you?
- $15.90

977
00:52:05,703 --> 00:52:07,978
- $15.90?
- Excuse me?

978
00:52:08,143 --> 00:52:10,418
- Do you speak Chinese?
- Chinese? Yeah.

979
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:11,982
Oh, look!

980
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:15,215
I'm on with Beijing
at the hair restoration clinic.

981
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,816
Could you talk to them for me...

982
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:19,213
...and tell them
I'd like to place an order?

983
00:52:29,783 --> 00:52:32,343
They've got a billion people over
there. He found a relative.

984
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:36,654
If you send money,
they send cream.

985
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,097
They send me. All right.

986
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:39,776
Ask them, does it really work?

987
00:52:43,183 --> 00:52:45,936
They say you grow hair.
Look like Stalin.

988
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:51,052
Ask them,
are there any side effects?

989
00:52:53,823 --> 00:52:55,700
lmpotence.

990
00:52:57,943 --> 00:53:01,299
Oh, funny.
He's a funny guy, yeah.

991
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,454
Get a money order
from the Bank of China.

992
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:05,420
Be here three days
after they get check.

993
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,016
All right, thank you. Thank you.

994
00:53:26,743 --> 00:53:28,222
Excuse me.

995
00:53:29,263 --> 00:53:30,412
Kind of an expensive call.

996
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,222
Thanks for driving me home.

997
00:53:34,383 --> 00:53:35,736
What did I do to deserve this?

998
00:53:35,903 --> 00:53:37,382
You do plenty.

999
00:53:38,463 --> 00:53:41,739
So, what are you doing?
You're... You're going in.

1000
00:53:41,903 --> 00:53:43,734
Well, yeah. I guess so.

1001
00:53:43,903 --> 00:53:45,621
Why, you want to do something?

1002
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:49,733
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know. What?

1003
00:53:52,223 --> 00:53:53,451
There's really nothing to do.

1004
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:56,137
Yeah, no. There's...
There's nothing.

1005
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:58,100
Can you think of anything?

1006
00:53:59,623 --> 00:54:01,295
No, no. Not really.

1007
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:03,780
I am up for anything.

1008
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:05,774
Really?

1009
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:11,054
I have to say...

1010
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:13,942
...you were really good
doing that porno thing.

1011
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:15,855
You're... You're talented.

1012
00:54:16,023 --> 00:54:17,741
I was just kidding around.

1013
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:21,303
That thing you said about
the sex not being simulated...

1014
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:24,817
That was really funny.

1015
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,578
Yeah, that was fun.

1016
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:33,858
So I'll speak to you
through Jerry and everything.

1017
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:35,661
Okay.

1018
00:54:35,823 --> 00:54:38,018
- Thanks a lot for the ride.
- Yeah, anytime.

1019
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:48,896
Thanks a million. I appreciate this.

1020
00:54:49,063 --> 00:54:50,974
You're sure this was
the woman at the table...

1021
00:54:51,143 --> 00:54:53,293
...where I had
my tape recorder?

1022
00:54:53,463 --> 00:54:55,135
Okay, great.

1023
00:54:55,303 --> 00:54:57,134
Thanks, again. Bye.

1024
00:54:59,183 --> 00:55:02,698
Who do these women
think they're dealing with?

1025
00:55:04,543 --> 00:55:07,376
Did she think she was gonna leave
this incredibly erotic message...

1026
00:55:07,543 --> 00:55:09,579
...on my tape,
and I was just gonna let it go?

1027
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:12,821
Not bloody likely.

1028
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:15,212
What is that?

1029
00:55:15,383 --> 00:55:17,453
- It's my cockney accent.
- No, no. That's no good.

1030
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:19,857
Let's hear yours.

1031
00:55:20,023 --> 00:55:22,253
Not bloody likely.

1032
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:28,137
That's the worst cockney accent
I ever heard in my life.

1033
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,653
Hey, Georgie boy,
guess what I got.

1034
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:33,541
Guess what I got.

1035
00:55:33,703 --> 00:55:34,897
Oh, is that the bald stuff?

1036
00:55:35,063 --> 00:55:36,655
From China.
All the way from China.

1037
00:55:36,823 --> 00:55:38,256
Wait, wait.
Let me get the camera.

1038
00:55:38,423 --> 00:55:42,177
No, don't get the camera.
We don't need the camera.

1039
00:55:42,343 --> 00:55:44,732
I know you're sceptical,
but I believe in the Chinese.

1040
00:55:44,903 --> 00:55:46,097
Yes, I am sceptical.

1041
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,132
Why do you have to be
so suspicious of everyone?

1042
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:51,339
This is a great man,
Zang Zhao.

1043
00:55:51,503 --> 00:55:53,221
He wants to help bald people.

1044
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,022
Wait, wait. Let's videotape
your head for the before picture.

1045
00:55:56,183 --> 00:55:57,855
So we can watch
how it grows and stuff.

1046
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:00,059
- Here, sit down.
- All right.

1047
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:07,179
All right, lean back.

1048
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:10,815
A little bit to the right.

1049
00:56:10,983 --> 00:56:12,974
Now make sure
you get this area here.

1050
00:56:13,143 --> 00:56:14,861
- That's where he needs help.
- All right.

1051
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:19,059
Well, he's a happy
camper, huh?

1052
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:22,420
Happy camper. Yeah,
I don't hear that expression enough.

1053
00:56:22,943 --> 00:56:24,501
Remember that guy
who took my jacket?

1054
00:56:24,663 --> 00:56:26,176
The one I found
at my mother's house?

1055
00:56:26,543 --> 00:56:27,692
- Yeah.
- My mother told me...

1056
00:56:27,863 --> 00:56:29,501
...that he got arrested
for mail fraud.

1057
00:56:29,663 --> 00:56:31,381
- No kidding.
- Yeah, he's in jail.

1058
00:56:31,543 --> 00:56:33,420
What about the jacket?
He take it with him?

1059
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,858
That's what I intend
to find out.

1060
00:56:39,143 --> 00:56:41,054
Well, you can see it.

1061
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:43,214
Are you gonna
walk around like that?

1062
00:56:43,663 --> 00:56:44,891
And it stinks.

1063
00:56:45,063 --> 00:56:46,462
Can you smell that?

1064
00:56:46,623 --> 00:56:48,420
You stink.

1065
00:56:50,543 --> 00:56:52,499
How long are you supposed
to leave it on for?

1066
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:54,221
All day.

1067
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,898
- Hello?
- Hello, it's Elaine Marie Benes.

1068
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:01,542
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

1069
00:57:01,703 --> 00:57:03,216
Did you find out
who that woman was?

1070
00:57:03,383 --> 00:57:05,214
Yes, I got her number.

1071
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:07,339
- Hey, is that Elaine?
- Yeah.

1072
00:57:07,503 --> 00:57:09,175
Hi, Elaine!

1073
00:57:09,623 --> 00:57:12,820
So I guess you figure
you're in for a pretty wild night.

1074
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:14,177
Well, as I said...

1075
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:17,221
...this type of thing is
very common in show business.

1076
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:20,331
Well, listen, I'm at Arlene's.
You want me to stop by?

1077
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,856
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

1078
00:57:22,023 --> 00:57:23,502
Bye.

1079
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,939
- Did she say "hello"?
- What? Oh, I don't know.

1080
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:30,418
What do you mean? She heard me
say hello. Did she say hello back?

1081
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,574
I don't know.
Who keeps track of hellos?

1082
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:35,940
Isn't it polite to say hello
when somebody says hello?

1083
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:39,462
She's coming up.

1084
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,614
- Elaine's coming up?
- Yeah, why? What's wrong?

1085
00:57:44,263 --> 00:57:46,857
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere, nowhere. I'll be right out.

1086
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:49,574
How often do you
cut your toenails?

1087
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:55,662
I would say every two and a half
to eight weeks.

1088
00:57:57,783 --> 00:58:00,013
Because the other night
I was sleeping with Marion...

1089
00:58:00,183 --> 00:58:03,061
...and I rolled over, and I
cut her ankle with my big toe.

1090
00:58:04,503 --> 00:58:06,733
The big toe, the captain.

1091
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,738
- What?
- The captain of the toes.

1092
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:15,856
- Hello?
- Jerry?

1093
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:17,251
- Yeah.
- Jerry, listen.

1094
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:19,618
I got too much to do.
I can't come over. Forget it.

1095
00:58:19,783 --> 00:58:20,977
Oh, okay, too bad.

1096
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:23,054
So when are you
gonna call her?

1097
00:58:23,223 --> 00:58:25,498
As soon as I get off
the phone with you.

1098
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,131
- Good luck.
- Okay.

1099
00:58:28,303 --> 00:58:30,021
- Bye.
- Bye.

1100
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:33,815
- What happened? You took it off?
- Yeah. That was enough.

1101
00:58:34,703 --> 00:58:35,852
That's it? You gave up?

1102
00:58:36,023 --> 00:58:37,854
No, I'm working on a system.
Who was that?

1103
00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:41,140
That was Elaine. She changed
her mind. She's not coming over.

1104
00:58:47,743 --> 00:58:50,621
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Alisha?

1105
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:53,377
- Yes.
- This is Jerry Seinfeld.

1106
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:04,335
- So?
- I don't get this woman.

1107
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:07,734
We're having a great time,
couple of laughs. Everything's nice.

1108
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,621
End of the night,
I go in for contact.

1109
00:59:09,783 --> 00:59:11,375
I get the pullback.

1110
00:59:11,783 --> 00:59:15,219
This woman, she said the filthiest
things I ever heard in my life.

1111
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:17,740
And I get the pullback.

1112
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:21,332
- Yeah?
- It's George.

1113
00:59:21,503 --> 00:59:23,061
Come on up.

1114
00:59:23,383 --> 00:59:24,816
What is he doing here now?

1115
00:59:24,983 --> 00:59:26,894
So you blew it?

1116
00:59:28,343 --> 00:59:30,015
She must be psychotic
or something.

1117
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:32,299
Let me have the number.

1118
00:59:32,463 --> 00:59:33,942
I'm not giving you the number.

1119
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,855
I know how to handle
these psychotics.

1120
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:43,261
Sheriff.

1121
00:59:45,943 --> 00:59:47,774
What's with the hat?

1122
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:51,375
Boy, you stink.

1123
00:59:52,663 --> 00:59:55,018
- What are you doing here now?
- I have to talk to you.

1124
00:59:55,183 --> 00:59:56,980
Let's take a look here,
see what we got.

1125
00:59:59,703 --> 01:00:01,295
Wait a second.

1126
01:00:01,943 --> 01:00:04,298
I think I see
something here, George.

1127
01:00:04,463 --> 01:00:08,502
- Let's go to the videotape.
- Oh, Kramer. No, no.

1128
01:00:10,503 --> 01:00:12,016
- What's up?
- I can't tell you now.

1129
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:13,935
- He'll be back in 10 seconds.
- Start it.

1130
01:00:14,103 --> 01:00:15,252
- I can't.
- Oh, come on.

1131
01:00:15,423 --> 01:00:18,415
He'll be over there for a half-hour.
He gets lost over there.

1132
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,779
- Come on. What is this about?
- All right.

1133
01:00:23,223 --> 01:00:24,656
I've become attracted to Elaine.

1134
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:27,902
All right.

1135
01:00:29,863 --> 01:00:31,455
- Sit down.
- Could we do this later?

1136
01:00:31,623 --> 01:00:33,534
No, I got the tape right here.

1137
01:00:33,703 --> 01:00:35,614
Kramer, let's do this later.

1138
01:00:35,783 --> 01:00:37,136
Okay, now...

1139
01:00:37,863 --> 01:00:40,218
This is the tape
that we made earlier.

1140
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,742
And I think...

1141
01:00:42,903 --> 01:00:45,542
...that I see a couple of buds...

1142
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,059
...right here.

1143
01:00:49,223 --> 01:00:50,861
- Really? You think?
- Yeah.

1144
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,662
Kramer, I would like to talk
to George for a minute, please.

1145
01:00:53,823 --> 01:00:55,461
- About what?
- It's kind of private.

1146
01:00:55,623 --> 01:00:57,261
Like the big toe captain? What?

1147
01:00:57,423 --> 01:01:00,335
- Oh, so you're doing my bit?
- I'm not doing the bit!

1148
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,575
All right.
Okay, all right.

1149
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,132
I'm gonna take
a look at this, huh?

1150
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:11,622
- Does she know?
- No.

1151
01:01:11,783 --> 01:01:14,377
- How did it happen?
- I can't say.

1152
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:16,818
- Well, why can't you say?
- Because I promised her.

1153
01:01:16,983 --> 01:01:19,213
- I thought you said she doesn't know.
- She doesn't.

1154
01:01:19,383 --> 01:01:21,692
- So how can you promise her?
- Because she asked me to.

1155
01:01:21,863 --> 01:01:23,933
What is this,
an Abbott and Costello routine?

1156
01:01:25,823 --> 01:01:27,700
All right, you really want to know?

1157
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:31,222
It all started
when she told me...

1158
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:33,858
...that she was the voice
on your tape recorder.

1159
01:01:34,463 --> 01:01:35,532
What? Elaine?

1160
01:01:35,703 --> 01:01:39,059
Yeah. She made me promise not
to tell. It was supposed to be a joke.

1161
01:01:39,223 --> 01:01:41,134
- That was Elaine?
- Yeah, let me hear.

1162
01:01:41,303 --> 01:01:44,420
- Wait a second! Give me a second...
- You heard it 50 times already...

1163
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:47,051
She's my ex-girlfriend.
I think I have precedence.

1164
01:01:52,983 --> 01:01:54,655
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Elaine.

1165
01:01:54,823 --> 01:01:56,859
Is this a bad time?

1166
01:01:57,143 --> 01:01:58,371
Yeah.

1167
01:01:59,223 --> 01:02:00,975
Don't tell her I told you!
She'll kill me!

1168
01:02:01,143 --> 01:02:03,293
Okay, I promise!

1169
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:12,181
Oh, man.

1170
01:02:13,023 --> 01:02:14,854
Oh, God.

1171
01:02:15,463 --> 01:02:17,738
Oh, brother.

1172
01:02:20,423 --> 01:02:24,575
- What's the matter?
- I got a pain in my side...

1173
01:02:25,463 --> 01:02:27,055
...from, you know...
- Hi, George.

1174
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:28,941
Hi, how you doing?

1175
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,452
Something stinks in here.

1176
01:02:37,223 --> 01:02:38,417
What are you doing here?

1177
01:02:39,183 --> 01:02:42,095
I was the one who talked
into your tape recorder.

1178
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:43,981
I know. George told me.

1179
01:02:48,183 --> 01:02:51,220
- You told him?
- He threatened me.

1180
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:54,852
Where did you come up
with all that stuff?

1181
01:02:55,023 --> 01:02:57,253
- Oh, that was nothing.
- Elaine...

1182
01:02:58,823 --> 01:03:00,620
- I have to tell you something.
- George, no.

1183
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:02,341
- No, no.
- George, I'm telling you...

1184
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:03,856
What is it?

1185
01:03:04,023 --> 01:03:05,741
I'm very attracted to you.

1186
01:03:06,423 --> 01:03:07,617
I found a hair!

1187
01:03:08,703 --> 01:03:09,897
Yes!

1188
01:03:10,063 --> 01:03:12,418
Okay, come here. Come here.
Take a look at this.

1189
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:16,337
Ever since I found out that you left
the message on Jerry's tape recorder...

1190
01:03:19,623 --> 01:03:22,296
- That was you?
- It was a joke.

1191
01:03:22,663 --> 01:03:24,972
Wait.

1192
01:03:25,463 --> 01:03:27,852
Oh, my God.

1193
01:03:28,383 --> 01:03:30,214
Oh, yeah.

1194
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:34,255
Elaine, I can't believe
that that is you.

1195
01:03:41,463 --> 01:03:42,976
I think I'll get going.

1196
01:03:43,143 --> 01:03:44,815
Stick around a while.

1197
01:03:44,983 --> 01:03:47,372
- It's early.
- We'll order Chinese.

1198
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:54,261
Give me the tape.
Give me the tape.

1199
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:03,819
A woman left a message
on my phone machine...

1200
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,621
...with kind of a breathy voice.

1201
01:04:05,783 --> 01:04:08,934
No matter what a woman says, if it's
in that breathy voice, you know...

1202
01:04:09,103 --> 01:04:10,092
"You have cancer."

1203
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,060
"Really?"

1204
01:04:13,623 --> 01:04:15,295
Sounds pretty good.

1205
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:19,332
The stewardess could lean over
and whisper in my ear:

1206
01:04:19,503 --> 01:04:20,856
"Would you put
on your seat belt.

1207
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,015
We're about to go
into a mountain."

1208
01:04:24,183 --> 01:04:26,174
I'd go, " Really, so
what are you doing later...

1209
01:04:26,343 --> 01:04:29,176
...by the ruptured remains
of the fuselage?

1210
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:32,141
How about some peanuts
over by the black box?

1211
01:04:32,823 --> 01:04:34,017
I'll meet you there."

1212

01:04:44,802 --> 01:04:47,111
Give me an explanation
why the pharmacist has to be...

1214
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:52,998
...two and a half feet up
above everybody else.

1215
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:56,951
What the hell is he doing he can't be
on the floor with you and me?

1216
01:04:57,122 --> 01:05:00,831
Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear
physicists, we're on the same level.

1217
01:05:01,162 --> 01:05:04,199
Oh, no, he's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

1218
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:07,718
"Look out, everybody,
I'm working with pills.

1219
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:09,953
Spread out, give me some room."

1220
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:13,121
The only hard part of his whole job
that I could see...

1221
01:05:13,322 --> 01:05:16,041
...is typing everything
onto that little, tiny label.

1222
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:19,082
And has to try and get
all the words on there...

1223
01:05:19,242 --> 01:05:22,678
...keep the little piece of paper
in the roller of the typewriter.

1224
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:25,800
Oh, no. He's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

1225
01:05:25,962 --> 01:05:30,080
"Yeah, I'd like to get this
prescription filled."

1226
01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:33,598
"All right. You wait down there.

1227
01:05:33,882 --> 01:05:35,474
Only I'm allowed up here."

1228
01:05:41,802 --> 01:05:43,997
- Where'd you meet her?
- I met her on an elevator.

1229
01:05:44,162 --> 01:05:46,881
On an elevator?
You met a woman on an elevator?

1230
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,795
- Impossible, right?
- You got less than 60 seconds.

1231
01:05:49,962 --> 01:05:52,317
That's like dismantling a time bomb.

1232
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:55,321
- What got into you?
- I don't know. She was so beautiful...

1233
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:57,200
...it was a pure reflex. The words...

1234
01:05:57,362 --> 01:06:00,195
...just came out of my mouth.
- Wow. What did you say?

1235
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:05,477
You know, I'm the one responsible
for those crop circles in England.

1236
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:10,037
- Can you believe I did that?
- What did she say?

1237
01:06:10,202 --> 01:06:12,193
What crop circles?

1238
01:06:13,962 --> 01:06:16,237
- Not a good sign.
- Not everybody knows...

1239
01:06:16,402 --> 01:06:19,394
...what the crop circles are.
You know what the crop circles are?

1240
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:21,632
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?

1241
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:23,561
You got something in your teeth.

1242
01:06:24,002 --> 01:06:25,720
- What?
- It's green.

1243
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:29,875
Oh, man, spinach. I've been
walking around like this all afternoon.

1244
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:33,671
- You bump into anybody you knew?
- I had a job interview.

1245
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:36,357
- How did it go?
- Take a guess.

1246
01:06:36,522 --> 01:06:39,559
Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing
available at the present time...

1247
01:06:39,722 --> 01:06:41,917
...but should anything open up,
we'll be in touch.

1248
01:06:42,322 --> 01:06:44,119
Okay, thanks.

1249
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:46,914
You don't need a job.
You got Audrey.

1250
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:48,834
Yeah. Right.

1251
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:51,473
- What's the matter?
- No. Nothing.

1252
01:06:52,162 --> 01:06:54,232
- What?
- You won't think I'm a bad person?

1253
01:06:54,562 --> 01:06:56,041
Too late for that.

1254
01:06:56,202 --> 01:06:59,956
Because, believe me, I would only say
this to you and maybe a psychiatrist.

1255
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:01,835
What is it?

1256
01:07:02,002 --> 01:07:03,435
Well...

1257
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:06,839
Her nose is a little big.

1258
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,801
Yeah, she's got a big nose.

1259
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:13,277
I mean, big would even be okay.

1260
01:07:13,802 --> 01:07:15,030
It's beyond big.

1261
01:07:16,482 --> 01:07:18,279
It's a schnoz.

1262
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,993
I'm aware that my own
physical dimensions...

1263
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,801
...are a little short of perfection.
- A little.

1264
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:26,197
Who am I to be thinking
about someone's nose?

1265
01:07:26,362 --> 01:07:30,435
I should be grateful someone like her
looks at me. I have no job, nothing.

1266
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:32,879
But I have to say,
I think about the nose.

1267
01:07:33,402 --> 01:07:36,997
I don't wanna think about it, I don't ask
to think about it, but I think about it.

1268
01:07:37,162 --> 01:07:41,121
I go to bed, I tell myself, " Don't
think about the nose." I think about it.

1269
01:07:41,322 --> 01:07:44,200
I look at her, I see the nose.

1270
01:07:45,122 --> 01:07:47,477
Stop being so concerned with looks.

1271
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:58,591
- Have you said anything to her?
- No. Could never do that.

1272
01:07:58,762 --> 01:08:00,798
The ironic thing is,
if she had a smaller nose...

1273
01:08:00,962 --> 01:08:05,035
...I never could've dated her. She'd be
out of my league with a smaller nose.

1274
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:08,594
And I really like her. I know that.

1275
01:08:08,762 --> 01:08:10,718
And I know one other thing:

1276
01:08:11,202 --> 01:08:13,238
I'm not getting past that nose.

1277
01:08:14,762 --> 01:08:16,434
All right, shut up. Here they come.

1278
01:08:17,042 --> 01:08:19,636
How can I not think about it?
Look at the size of this thing.

1279
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:25,555
My mother's going out with this guy
who leaves a jacket in her house.

1280
01:08:25,722 --> 01:08:29,840
She gives to me. Well, two years later,
he shows up and takes it back.

1281
01:08:30,202 --> 01:08:33,717
Now he's in prison.
Got arrested for mail fraud.

1282
01:08:34,162 --> 01:08:38,678
So, Elaine, go over to the apartment,
tell the landlord you're his daughter...

1283
01:08:38,842 --> 01:08:40,594
...and you wanna bring him
the jacket.

1284
01:08:40,762 --> 01:08:43,230
Won't the landlord know
I'm not the daughter?

1285
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:45,791
No, he's never met her.
She's in California.

1286
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:50,278
- Are you coming with me?
- Yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé.

1287
01:08:52,682 --> 01:08:54,240
Peter Von Nostrand.

1288
01:08:54,402 --> 01:08:56,438
Why don't you just
commit yourself already?

1289
01:08:57,682 --> 01:08:59,320
What is so special
about this jacket?

1290
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:01,677
- No, you don't wanna know.
- God...

1291
01:09:01,842 --> 01:09:05,801
He believes it possesses some
extraordinary power over women.

1292
01:09:05,962 --> 01:09:07,714
What's that splotch on your hand?

1293
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:10,715
I got stamped at the
reggae lounge last night.

1294
01:09:10,882 --> 01:09:14,192
I'm going back there tonight. I'm not
gonna pay another cover charge.

1295
01:09:15,602 --> 01:09:16,921
You didn't wash all day?

1296
01:09:17,242 --> 01:09:20,279
Yeah, I washed. Just not the hand.

1297
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:24,875
You wouldn't believe the women
at this club. Man.

1298
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,881
It's amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

1299
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:29,959
I actually find it kind of intimidating.

1300
01:09:30,122 --> 01:09:32,841
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

1301
01:09:39,202 --> 01:09:41,796
- Kramer!
- What? What?

1302
01:09:41,962 --> 01:09:44,032
How could you say
something like that?

1303
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:46,432
What do you mean?
I just said she needs a nose job.

1304
01:09:46,602 --> 01:09:49,400
No, no. There's nothing wrong
with her nose.

1305
01:09:49,562 --> 01:09:52,281
- God, I'm so sorry, Audrey.
- Oh, it's okay.

1306
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:55,718
- What did you have to say that for?
- I was just trying to help out.

1307
01:09:56,522 --> 01:10:00,674
Yeah, well, you can kiss that jacket
goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

1308
01:10:02,562 --> 01:10:04,598
You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

1309
01:10:06,122 --> 01:10:08,158
But what would the world be like...

1310
01:10:08,362 --> 01:10:10,478
...if people said whatever
they were thinking...

1311
01:10:11,122 --> 01:10:13,317
...all the time,
whenever it came to them?

1312
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:16,679
How long would a blind date last?

1313
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:18,753
About 13 seconds, I think.

1314
01:10:19,162 --> 01:10:21,915
"Sorry, your rear end is too big."
"Okay, your breath stinks."

1315
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:25,040
"See you later. No problem. Goodbye."
"Okay, thank you very much."

1316
01:10:25,642 --> 01:10:28,520
Elaine said I can stay with her
another month till Tina gets back.

1317
01:10:29,482 --> 01:10:30,915
What are you thinking about?

1318
01:10:31,802 --> 01:10:33,520
Thinking? Nothing.

1319
01:10:33,682 --> 01:10:35,877
What could I possibly be thinking?

1320
01:10:36,242 --> 01:10:38,710
You look like you've got something
on your mind.

1321
01:10:38,882 --> 01:10:42,761
Yeah, right. I wish I had
something on my mind.

1322
01:10:47,642 --> 01:10:48,995
So how about that Kramer?

1323
01:10:49,562 --> 01:10:51,553
Yeah, how about him?

1324
01:10:51,722 --> 01:10:55,351
- The way he just says stuff.
- He sure does.

1325
01:10:55,522 --> 01:10:57,319
Yeah, yeah.

1326
01:10:58,162 --> 01:11:00,153
Yeah, he's quite a character.

1327
01:11:01,122 --> 01:11:03,238
So, what did you think?

1328
01:11:03,602 --> 01:11:04,955
About the pizza?

1329
01:11:05,602 --> 01:11:07,832
No. About the nose job.

1330
01:11:08,482 --> 01:11:11,599
Oh, the nose job. Yeah...

1331
01:11:11,882 --> 01:11:13,315
I don't know. l...

1332
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:17,631
- Well, what did you think?
- Well, I've thought about it...

1333
01:11:17,882 --> 01:11:20,521
...but I don't know.
- Yeah.

1334
01:11:22,522 --> 01:11:25,639
You know, not that I care
one way or the other...

1335
01:11:25,802 --> 01:11:29,477
...but these doctors today do amazing
things. If you were so inclined.

1336
01:11:29,682 --> 01:11:34,119
- And again, I'm not suggesting.
- I know. They're good.

1337
01:11:34,282 --> 01:11:35,874
Peter Jennings had one.

1338
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,112
- Really?
- Probably. They all do.

1339
01:11:38,282 --> 01:11:41,194
In my high school,
half my graduating class had them.

1340
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:43,637
Of course,
I'm from Long Island, so...

1341
01:11:47,562 --> 01:11:49,792
It's really nothing.
It's like going to the dentist.

1342
01:11:50,522 --> 01:11:53,719
- I hate the dentist.
- It's a cleaning.

1343
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:57,154
So you really think I should do this.

1344
01:11:57,842 --> 01:12:01,801
If it makes you happy.
I don't focus on these things.

1345
01:12:03,562 --> 01:12:05,280
I will tell you this, though.

1346
01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:08,393
Unfortunately...

1347
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:11,156
...we live in a very
superficial society.

1348
01:12:12,402 --> 01:12:14,040
I don't condone it...

1349
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,350
...but it's a fact of life.

1350
01:12:17,682 --> 01:12:19,513
Well, maybe I should.

1351
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:23,079
- What the hell?
- Now you talked her into a nose job?

1352
01:12:23,242 --> 01:12:26,279
- Me? I didn't say anything.
- You encouraged her to get one.

1353
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,161
- I didn't encourage. No encourage.
- "Peter Jennings had one"?

1354
01:12:29,842 --> 01:12:31,070
It's possible.

1355
01:12:31,362 --> 01:12:34,718
- You should accept her for who she is.
- No, George is right.

1356
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:37,157
- I wanna get one.
- I think it's a mistake.

1357
01:12:37,322 --> 01:12:38,914
Me too. Really.

1358
01:12:40,402 --> 01:12:42,279
Unless you'd really like one, then...

1359
01:12:45,482 --> 01:12:47,279
I'm going straight to hell.

1360
01:12:48,442 --> 01:12:49,636
No two ways about it.

1361
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:52,475
It might not be hell,
but you're gonna run into bad dudes.

1362
01:12:54,642 --> 01:12:56,997
Get the check.
She takes the bandages off at 4:00.

1363
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:58,754
We have time.

1364
01:12:59,722 --> 01:13:01,758
It's exciting.
She's gonna have a new face.

1365
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:05,797
- It is exciting.
- Not as exciting as Miss Crop Circles.

1366
01:13:06,522 --> 01:13:09,320
Please, please. Isabel?

1367
01:13:09,482 --> 01:13:12,679
She is the most despicable woman
I have ever met in my life.

1368
01:13:12,842 --> 01:13:16,517
I have never been so repulsed
by someone mentally...

1369
01:13:16,682 --> 01:13:20,197
...and so attracted to them physically
at the same time.

1370
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:23,877
It's like my brain is facing my penis
in a chess game.

1371
01:13:28,522 --> 01:13:30,114
And I'm letting him win.

1372
01:13:30,562 --> 01:13:33,156
You're not letting him win.
He wins till you're 40.

1373
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:36,758
- Then what?
- He still wins, but it's not a blowout.

1374
01:13:38,922 --> 01:13:40,355
She wants to be an actress.

1375
01:13:40,522 --> 01:13:44,276
She makes me read these moronic
acting scenes with her, and I do it.

1376
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:49,158
Because I'm so addicted to the sex,
I'm helpless. I'll do anything.

1377
01:13:49,402 --> 01:13:51,552
So, finally, Kramer comes in
the other day.

1378
01:13:52,002 --> 01:13:54,038
I don't want to see this woman
anymore...

1379
01:13:54,202 --> 01:13:56,670
...but I haven't got the willpower
to throw out her number.

1380
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:58,480
Please help me.

1381
01:13:59,322 --> 01:14:00,675
Help me.

1382
01:14:05,402 --> 01:14:06,596
I'm proud of you.

1383
01:14:09,162 --> 01:14:11,881
So I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm going cold turkey.

1384
01:14:12,042 --> 01:14:13,361
Good for you.

1385
01:14:14,762 --> 01:14:17,322
I'll tell you, the sex...

1386
01:14:18,722 --> 01:14:21,156
I was like an animal.

1387
01:14:21,322 --> 01:14:23,392
I mean, it was just
completely uninhibited.

1388
01:14:24,322 --> 01:14:28,679
It's like going to the bathroom in front
of a lot of people, and not caring.

1389
01:14:33,162 --> 01:14:35,073
It's not like that at all.

1390
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:41,433
How do you even know
the jacket is there?

1391
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:43,556
Well, I don't. I'm guessing.

1392
01:14:44,202 --> 01:14:47,080
Okay, look, Audrey,
before you take the bandage off...

1393
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:50,315
...just remember, I was the one
that encouraged you to do this.

1394
01:14:50,522 --> 01:14:54,197
Now that you're gonna be a great
beauty, let's not forget how this began.

1395
01:14:54,362 --> 01:14:56,637
- lf you listened to your friend Elaine...
- George.

1396
01:14:56,962 --> 01:14:58,315
- Yeah?
- Enough.

1397
01:14:58,482 --> 01:14:59,881
- Right, enough.
- Are we ready?

1398
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:01,839
Come on,
let's get this show on the road.

1399
01:15:02,042 --> 01:15:04,431
- You sure you want us here for this?
- Yes.

1400
01:15:04,762 --> 01:15:08,038
- Shouldn't a doctor do it?
- No, he said I could do it.

1401
01:15:08,202 --> 01:15:09,954
Okay, here goes.

1402
01:15:10,122 --> 01:15:13,637
This is very exciting. Very exciting.
It's like watching a birth.

1403
01:15:18,282 --> 01:15:20,034
It looks good.

1404
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:23,470
- Great job.
- You got butchered.

1405
01:15:30,522 --> 01:15:32,513
Head hurt.
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

1406
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:34,639
Let's put him over here.

1407
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:37,792
- Where are you going?
- To that doctor.

1408
01:15:38,002 --> 01:15:39,833
Wait, wait, wait! I'll go with you.

1409
01:15:49,322 --> 01:15:51,074
How you feeling?

1410
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:54,636
Too much salt in my diet.

1411
01:15:55,442 --> 01:15:57,797
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm good.

1412
01:15:58,282 --> 01:16:00,512
You sure? Anything.

1413
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:03,995
No.

1414
01:16:07,402 --> 01:16:09,836
Boy, it really didn't come out
too well, did it?

1415
01:16:10,122 --> 01:16:13,432
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

1416
01:16:14,522 --> 01:16:15,921
It's, like, all dented.

1417
01:16:17,482 --> 01:16:19,200
Seems to be.

1418
01:16:21,762 --> 01:16:23,753
Well, I'm sure
they'll be able to fix it.

1419
01:16:24,002 --> 01:16:28,678
You can't stop modern science.
Can't stop it. Can't stop science.

1420
01:16:28,842 --> 01:16:31,720
Can't be stopped. No way, no how.
Science just marches...

1421
01:16:31,882 --> 01:16:33,838
Shut up, George.

1422
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,077
- Shut up?
- Yeah.

1423
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,720
Interesting.

1424
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:46,593
Come on, Kramer.
Seriously, give me her number!

1425
01:16:46,762 --> 01:16:48,275
- I threw it out.
- You're lying.

1426
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:50,592
- You've got it. I want the number.
- I threw it out.

1427
01:16:50,802 --> 01:16:52,793
- Give it to me.
- You said not to.

1428
01:16:52,962 --> 01:16:55,556
- You made me promise.
- I changed my mind. I want it.

1429
01:16:55,722 --> 01:16:57,599
You said no matter what,
I'm not to give it to you.

1430
01:16:57,762 --> 01:16:59,832
- I was lying. Give it to me.
- You told me not to.

1431
01:17:00,002 --> 01:17:02,800
- I want the number!
- All right! You want it? Yeah!

1432
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:06,274
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah, look at you.

1433
01:17:06,562 --> 01:17:08,473
Look at what you've sunk to.

1434
01:17:08,642 --> 01:17:09,961
Look at what you've become.

1435
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:13,154
Look in the mirror, because you
need help, Jerry. You need help.

1436
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:17,317
Because I can't stand by and do it
anymore. It's turning my stomach.

1437
01:17:17,482 --> 01:17:20,792
I can't stand around here
watching you destroy yourself!

1438
01:17:20,962 --> 01:17:23,237
It's eating me up inside!

1439
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:39,231
The doctor said they need to build the
lateral wall of the septum. Over here.

1440
01:17:39,442 --> 01:17:40,670
Yeah.

1441
01:17:40,842 --> 01:17:43,515
- You see this paranasal sinus cavity?
- Oh, I got it.

1442
01:17:43,682 --> 01:17:48,039
See how it's collapsed?
That's what's causing this huge dent.

1443
01:17:48,202 --> 01:17:50,477
Yeah. Rough, rough.

1444
01:17:51,722 --> 01:17:53,758
So anyway, you know what
I was thinking about?

1445
01:17:54,282 --> 01:17:55,510
What?

1446
01:17:55,682 --> 01:17:58,435
Remember we talked
about taking a trip together?

1447
01:17:58,642 --> 01:18:02,715
- We did?
- We talked about going to Hawaii.

1448
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:05,278
- Hawaii?
- Anyway, I think it would be great...

1449
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:07,910
...to get away after all this.

1450
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:09,955
Well, you...

1451
01:18:12,082 --> 01:18:14,437
You know, Hawaii could be
a little tricky now.

1452
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:17,321
There's high-pressure winds
down there this time of year.

1453
01:18:17,482 --> 01:18:20,474
There's a lot of debris
constantly flying around, a lot of...

1454
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:22,678
...wood and lava.

1455
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:24,521
It could be dangerous.

1456
01:18:24,722 --> 01:18:28,158
- I never heard that.
- Oh, yeah. My friend lived there, so...

1457
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:30,916
We could go to the Caribbean.

1458
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:34,840
I have to tell you something.
You couldn't get me on a plane now.

1459
01:18:35,122 --> 01:18:36,999
I get those FAA reports directly.

1460
01:18:37,202 --> 01:18:40,035
My uncle sends them to me.
He used to be a pilot, so...

1461
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:42,280
Big investigation in the...

1462
01:18:42,922 --> 01:18:47,313
What's the word there?
Offing. It's in the offing.

1463
01:18:47,642 --> 01:18:53,000
But you shouldn't let that stop you
from going. You could go. I don't mind.

1464
01:18:53,882 --> 01:18:55,759
- George?
- Yeah.

1465
01:18:56,082 --> 01:18:58,152
I don't think this is working.

1466
01:18:59,242 --> 01:19:04,157
Ever since you came back from
the Army, you've changed.

1467
01:19:04,922 --> 01:19:09,473
I swear, Nelson, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1468
01:19:09,722 --> 01:19:11,713
I'm Nelson.

1469
01:19:13,002 --> 01:19:16,517
- That's not the line, Jerry.
- All right, all right, I'm sorry.

1470
01:19:17,802 --> 01:19:21,795
Nothing's changed, Elma.
I just need more time.

1471
01:19:23,362 --> 01:19:27,514
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at
night when you're not around...

1472
01:19:28,282 --> 01:19:31,718
...I just go crazy thinking
about you.

1473
01:19:32,122 --> 01:19:33,601
Well, you just need to relax.

1474
01:19:35,362 --> 01:19:37,000
Maybe a hobby. Bowling is fun.

1475
01:19:38,082 --> 01:19:41,631
Yeah, bowling's good,
if you're really gross and ugly.

1476
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:44,671
Uh-oh. My organs
are playing chess again.

1477
01:19:44,842 --> 01:19:48,676
I'm getting tired of this. What do you
say we play one for all the marbles?

1478
01:19:48,842 --> 01:19:52,198
Oh, brain, what are you doing?
You cannot beat me.

1479
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:55,718
Do you have any idea who you're
dealing with? Forget about it.

1480
01:19:55,882 --> 01:19:57,315
I can't take her anymore.

1481
01:19:57,482 --> 01:20:00,997
- I hate reading her little acting scenes.
- Oh, so what?

1482
01:20:01,162 --> 01:20:02,880
So you read from a little play.

1483
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:06,398
You can't put up with that for an hour
to make me happy? You're so selfish.

1484
01:20:06,562 --> 01:20:08,154
Give me one hour.

1485
01:20:08,602 --> 01:20:11,400
Then I will take over. You won't
have to think for the rest of the night.

1486
01:20:11,562 --> 01:20:12,915
What about tomorrow morning?

1487
01:20:13,082 --> 01:20:16,518
Do you have any idea what
that's like for me? Do you care?

1488
01:20:16,682 --> 01:20:18,115
No, you don't care.

1489
01:20:18,282 --> 01:20:21,718
So long as you get to do
whatever it is you do.

1490
01:20:21,882 --> 01:20:24,316
- You disgust me.
- Oh, go read a book.

1491
01:20:24,482 --> 01:20:27,360
Enough chatter. Let's play.

1492
01:20:28,202 --> 01:20:31,035
I'm only doing this because
you took Audrey to the hospital.

1493
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:34,439
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, now, you're clear?
You got everything?

1494
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:36,115
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1495
01:20:37,682 --> 01:20:38,910
Here.

1496
01:20:39,362 --> 01:20:42,593
- What do I need this for?
- Because we're engaged.

1497
01:20:43,242 --> 01:20:45,312
We're engaged?

1498
01:20:45,682 --> 01:20:47,354
Kramer, this is too big.

1499
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:51,039
- It's my mom's.
- Hello!

1500
01:20:51,202 --> 01:20:55,480
Oh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper.
I'm Albert Pepper's daughter.

1501
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:58,110
My father asked me to pick up
his jacket for him.

1502
01:20:58,282 --> 01:21:00,512
Hello, Miss Pepper.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1503
01:21:00,762 --> 01:21:02,992
And you must be
Professor Von Nostrand.

1504
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:04,356
Yes. Yes, I am.

1505
01:21:05,122 --> 01:21:08,637
I've read your book, professor,
and I was quite intrigued by it.

1506
01:21:09,122 --> 01:21:11,955
- Yes, well, it's very intriguing.
- Tell me...

1507
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:15,239
...is it your contention that
Shakespeare was an impostor?

1508
01:21:15,402 --> 01:21:16,835
- My contention?
- Your contention.

1509
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:19,994
- Well, yes, that's my contention.
- I heard him contend that.

1510
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:22,153
It's too bad about your father.

1511
01:21:22,322 --> 01:21:25,917
- It was a frame-up.
- A fine man. He spoke often of you.

1512
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:28,312
He's very proud of the work
you're doing.

1513
01:21:28,682 --> 01:21:32,311
- We're all proud of the work I'm doing.
- Yes, she does fine work.

1514
01:21:32,522 --> 01:21:36,834
Your father gave me strict orders
not to turn the jacket over to anyone...

1515
01:21:37,002 --> 01:21:39,562
...but I suppose I can make
an exception in your case.

1516
01:21:39,722 --> 01:21:41,792
- The closet's this way.
- How kind of you.

1517
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:44,994
You know, your father has a very
extensive wardrobe.

1518
01:21:45,162 --> 01:21:46,754
Yes.

1519
01:21:50,922 --> 01:21:53,311
What's the matter, fella?
You look a little tired.

1520
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:56,193
Nelson, don't you see?

1521
01:21:57,642 --> 01:21:59,792
You are a part of me.

1522
01:22:00,522 --> 01:22:02,194
And I...

1523
01:22:02,802 --> 01:22:05,316
I am a part of you.

1524
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:07,395
She's killing me.

1525
01:22:13,682 --> 01:22:15,081
That's your move?

1526
01:22:15,242 --> 01:22:17,881
- Yeah.
- Well, that's trouble, my friend.

1527
01:22:18,042 --> 01:22:19,794
That's big trouble.

1528
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:21,435
Checkmate.

1529
01:22:24,042 --> 01:22:26,602
Getting weak. Losing power.

1530
01:22:27,282 --> 01:22:30,433
You haven't seen the last of me.
I'll be back.

1531
01:22:30,922 --> 01:22:34,551
You're nothing without me.
Nothing.

1532
01:22:36,562 --> 01:22:38,280
Little punk.

1533
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:43,953
Isabel, I don't think this is working.

1534
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:50,515
Daddy certainly does have
an extensive wardrobe.

1535
01:22:50,682 --> 01:22:55,392
He is a fine dresser. I don't have to tell
you he's quite popular with the ladies.

1536
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:58,952
My father? Really? I had no idea.

1537
01:22:59,122 --> 01:23:00,350
They're crazy about him.

1538
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:03,878
One in particular came around
about two years ago.

1539
01:23:04,442 --> 01:23:07,161
Looked a lot like you, professor.
Could have been your mother.

1540
01:23:07,562 --> 01:23:09,712
What was her name again?

1541
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:12,352
Carter? Kramer. That's it.

1542
01:23:12,642 --> 01:23:15,714
Babs Kramer. Nasty woman.

1543
01:23:15,882 --> 01:23:18,032
Many a night I had to
throw her on the street...

1544
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,591
...drunken stumblebum.
- You don't say.

1545
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:23,993
- I found it!
- She walked around here half-naked...

1546
01:23:24,162 --> 01:23:27,313
...sucking Colt 45 from a can.

1547
01:23:27,482 --> 01:23:31,395
Her big, fat stomach hanging out,
orthopaedic hose up to her knees...

1548
01:23:31,562 --> 01:23:33,280
...screaming down the hall:

1549
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:36,195
"Come back to bed, Albert,
you big hairy ape!

1550
01:23:36,362 --> 01:23:39,957
And bring back that box of Danish!"

1551
01:23:41,442 --> 01:23:44,036
- So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
- Yeah, and I yelled out:

1552
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:46,557
"Kramer, Kramer, you're killing him."

1553
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,636
- So I assume the jig was up.
- Yeah, pretty much.

1554
01:23:49,802 --> 01:23:51,474
But look.

1555
01:23:51,802 --> 01:23:53,235
Yes.

1556
01:23:54,442 --> 01:23:57,240
- Hi. Here are your keys.
- Hi. Thank you.

1557
01:23:57,402 --> 01:23:59,313
- Hello.
- Audrey.

1558
01:24:00,482 --> 01:24:03,474
My God, you look incredible.
I can't believe it.

1559
01:24:04,202 --> 01:24:07,194
Well, it was his doctor.
He was wonderful.

1560
01:24:07,482 --> 01:24:09,234
So will I see you later tonight?

1561
01:24:09,762 --> 01:24:11,718
Not sure.

1562
01:24:13,602 --> 01:24:16,116
Well, I'll check you guys out later.

1563
01:24:16,842 --> 01:24:18,673
- Ready?
- I didn't wash.

1564
01:24:18,842 --> 01:24:20,673
Neither did I.

1565
01:24:21,202 --> 01:24:23,557
We're off to the reggae lounge.

1566
01:24:30,562 --> 01:24:34,191
My nose, my nose.
My kingdom for a nose.

1567
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:39,114
Isn't she beautiful? Her nose
is in such perfect proportions...

1568
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,796
...to the rest of her face.
She's breathtaking.

1569
01:24:41,962 --> 01:24:44,351
- Who would have thought, she's...?
- Elaine...

1570
01:24:44,882 --> 01:24:46,440
...shut up.

1571
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,795
The technical term
for a nose job is...?

1572
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,914
- Rhinoplasty.
- Rhinoplasty.

1573
01:24:54,602 --> 01:24:57,719
Rhino. Okay?

1574
01:24:58,762 --> 01:25:03,552
Do we really need to insult the person
at this moment of their lives?

1575
01:25:03,722 --> 01:25:06,634
They know they have a big nose.
That's why they're coming in.

1576
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:10,158
Do they really need the abuse
of being compared to a rhinoceros...

1577
01:25:10,362 --> 01:25:12,432
...on top of everything else?

1578
01:25:12,802 --> 01:25:15,032
When someone has a
hair transplant, they don't go:

1579
01:25:15,202 --> 01:25:18,433
"We're going to perform a
cue ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson.

1580
01:25:19,162 --> 01:25:22,711
We're going to attempt to remove
the skinheadia...

1581
01:25:22,882 --> 01:25:26,113
...of your chromedomus,
which is what we...

1582
01:25:26,282 --> 01:25:28,716
The technical term..."

1583

01:26:19,477 --> 01:26:21,229
It seems the way they
design the car alarms...

1585
01:26:22,717 --> 01:26:26,505
...is so that the car will behave as if it
was a nervous, hysterical person.

1586
01:26:26,677 --> 01:26:30,670
Anyone goes near it,
anyone disturbs it, it's:

1587
01:26:30,837 --> 01:26:33,670
Lights flashing on and off,
acting all crazy.

1588
01:26:33,837 --> 01:26:36,431
Not everyone wants to draw
that much attention to themselves.

1589
01:26:36,597 --> 01:26:39,191
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a car alarm that was more subtle?

1590
01:26:39,357 --> 01:26:42,349
Maybe just, you know, somebody
tries to break in, and it goes:

1591
01:26:47,637 --> 01:26:49,355
"Excuse me?"

1592
01:26:49,797 --> 01:26:52,470
I would like a car alarm like that.

1593
01:26:58,317 --> 01:26:59,830
Do you believe this?

1594
01:26:59,997 --> 01:27:01,555
Car was parked right out front.

1595
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:04,470
- Was the alarm on?
- I don't know. I guess it was on.

1596
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:08,630
I don't know my alarm sound.
I'm not tuned into it like it's my son.

1597
01:27:09,077 --> 01:27:11,796
I don't understand. How do
these thieves start the car?

1598
01:27:11,957 --> 01:27:15,108
- They cross the wires or something.
- Cross the wires?

1599
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:17,427
I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

1600
01:27:17,597 --> 01:27:19,792
- Hey.
- They stole my car.

1601
01:27:19,957 --> 01:27:22,027
- Who did?
- They did.

1602
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:23,994
Was it more than just one?

1603
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:25,636
What should I do?
Call the police?

1604
01:27:26,197 --> 01:27:28,347
What are they gonna do?

1605
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:32,506
You know, I'd better call the car-phone
company, cancel my service.

1606
01:27:33,197 --> 01:27:35,188
Maybe you should
call your car phone.

1607
01:27:35,357 --> 01:27:37,268
Yeah.

1608
01:27:37,437 --> 01:27:39,553
He's probably driving it right now.

1609
01:27:39,717 --> 01:27:42,595
Wait a minute. Call the car phone.
See what happens.

1610
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,475
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, go ahead. Call.

1611
01:27:44,637 --> 01:27:47,390
I don't even know if I
remember the number.

1612
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,672
What do I say if he picks up?

1613
01:27:50,837 --> 01:27:52,589
- Hello.
- Hello.

1614
01:27:52,757 --> 01:27:57,911
- Is this 555-8383?
- I have no idea.

1615
01:27:58,077 --> 01:28:00,227
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1616
01:28:00,477 --> 01:28:03,594
- Did you steal my car?
- Yes, I did.

1617
01:28:05,517 --> 01:28:07,473
- You did?
- I did.

1618
01:28:07,637 --> 01:28:11,312
- But that's my car.
- I didn't know it was yours.

1619
01:28:11,477 --> 01:28:15,072
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I don't know. Drive around.

1620
01:28:15,237 --> 01:28:18,627
- Then can I have it back?
- No, I'm gonna k eep it.

1621
01:28:18,797 --> 01:28:21,834
Let me talk to him.
Give it, give it, give it.

1622
01:28:23,877 --> 01:28:25,754
- Hello.
- Yeah, who's this?

1623
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:27,350
- Kramer.
- Hello, Kramer.

1624
01:28:27,517 --> 01:28:31,226
Listen, there's a pair of gloves
in the glove compartment.

1625
01:28:31,397 --> 01:28:32,796
Wait, hold it.

1626
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:36,428
- Brown ones?
- Yeah.

1627
01:28:36,597 --> 01:28:39,270
Could you mail those to me?
Or bring them by my building.

1628
01:28:39,437 --> 01:28:42,668
- It's 129 West 81 st Street.
- 129... Okay.

1629
01:28:42,837 --> 01:28:46,466
All right, thanks a lot.
Here's Jerry.

1630
01:28:49,317 --> 01:28:50,750
Gloves.

1631
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:52,669
- Hello.
- Jerry.

1632
01:28:53,477 --> 01:28:57,914
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.
How do you cross those wires?

1633
01:28:58,077 --> 01:29:00,113
I didn't cross any wires.
The k eys were in it.

1634
01:29:00,277 --> 01:29:05,112
Sid left the keys in the car.
All right, I gotta go. Drive carefully.

1635
01:29:05,517 --> 01:29:09,476
Hey, Jerry, when's the last time you
had a tune-up? Because I can't find...

1636
01:29:09,637 --> 01:29:12,390
- Sid left the keys in the car.
- Who's Sid?

1637
01:29:12,557 --> 01:29:14,752
Guy in the neighbourhood.
He parks cars on the block.

1638
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:17,112
- What do you mean?
- He moves them from side to side...

1639
01:29:17,277 --> 01:29:19,666
...so you don't get a ticket.
- You pay him for that?

1640
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:22,715
- Yeah. Like 50 bucks a month.
- How many people does he do it for?

1641
01:29:22,877 --> 01:29:26,313
- The whole block, 40, 50 cars.
- He only works three hours a day.

1642
01:29:26,477 --> 01:29:30,390
He makes a fortune. He's been
doing that for years, right, Jerry?

1643
01:29:30,877 --> 01:29:32,151
Could anybody do that?

1644
01:29:32,317 --> 01:29:35,468
- Hey, Sid. What happened?
- I'm sorry, Jerry.

1645
01:29:35,637 --> 01:29:37,229
Maybe I'm too old for this stuff.

1646
01:29:37,397 --> 01:29:39,035
You left the keys in the car?

1647
01:29:39,197 --> 01:29:41,711
Well, they're making that
Woody Allen movie on the block...

1648
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:44,630
...and all those people
and trucks everywhere...

1649
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:46,992
...and when I saw him,
I must've been distracted.

1650
01:29:47,157 --> 01:29:49,227
- You know I'm in that movie.
- You're what?

1651
01:29:49,397 --> 01:29:51,513
- Yeah, I'm an extra.
- How'd you get that?

1652
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:54,953
Well, I was just watching them film
yesterday, and some guy asked me.

1653
01:29:55,117 --> 01:29:58,393
- Right out of the clear blue sky?
- Clear blue sky.

1654
01:29:58,557 --> 01:30:01,515
- Why didn't they ask me?
- I got a quality.

1655
01:30:01,677 --> 01:30:06,546
- Hey, Jerry, you got insurance, right?
- Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.

1656
01:30:06,717 --> 01:30:09,231
I'm going to visit my sister
in Virginia next Wednesday...

1657
01:30:09,397 --> 01:30:11,149
...for a week, so I can't park it.

1658
01:30:11,317 --> 01:30:12,955
- This Wednesday?
- No, next Wednesday.

1659
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:14,311
Week after this Wednesday.

1660
01:30:14,477 --> 01:30:17,708
But the Wednesday two days
from now is the next Wednesday.

1661
01:30:18,517 --> 01:30:21,031
If I meant this Wednesday,
I would've said this Wednesday.

1662
01:30:21,197 --> 01:30:23,870
It's the week after this Wednesday.

1663
01:30:25,757 --> 01:30:28,146
Sid, who's gonna move the cars
while you're away?

1664
01:30:28,317 --> 01:30:30,785
Whoever wants to move them.
What do I care who moves them?

1665
01:30:30,957 --> 01:30:32,549
They can move themselves
if they want.

1666
01:30:32,717 --> 01:30:34,833
Maybe I could move them
until you get back.

1667
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:38,672
What's a young man like you want
to move cars for? You don't work?

1668
01:30:38,837 --> 01:30:40,793
I'm in a transition phase right now.

1669
01:30:41,077 --> 01:30:43,830
Well, if you want to move the cars,
move the cars.

1670
01:30:43,997 --> 01:30:47,512
- Just don't forget to take the keys out.
- All right.

1671
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:53,912
Hello. Yeah, the defroster's
the one on the bottom.

1672
01:30:54,077 --> 01:30:56,307
Just slide it all the way over.

1673
01:30:57,197 --> 01:30:58,391
You're welcome.

1674
01:30:58,557 --> 01:31:01,276
I'm in awe of his intellect.
When he talks, it sounds like...

1675
01:31:01,437 --> 01:31:05,032
...he's reading from one of his novels.
- Owen March. I never heard of him.

1676
01:31:05,357 --> 01:31:08,667
- Well, he's not a baseball player.
- Yeah, that's true.

1677
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:12,716
- It sounds like it's going pretty good.
- Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

1678
01:31:12,877 --> 01:31:15,311
- What's that?
- He's 66 years old.

1679
01:31:15,477 --> 01:31:17,911
Next, please.

1680
01:31:18,077 --> 01:31:19,829
Go. Go. She...

1681
01:31:19,997 --> 01:31:21,510
Go. Come on.

1682
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:23,156
Can I help you? Name, please.

1683
01:31:23,317 --> 01:31:28,710
Seinfeld. I made a reservation
for a midsize, and she's a small.

1684
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:32,390
- I'm kidding around, of course.
- Yes.

1685
01:31:32,557 --> 01:31:34,149
Okay, let's see here.

1686
01:31:34,317 --> 01:31:38,515
- Sixty-six years old?
- Yeah, well, he's in perfect health.

1687
01:31:38,677 --> 01:31:41,350
He works out. He's vibrant.
You'd really like him.

1688
01:31:41,517 --> 01:31:45,430
Why do people always say that? I hate
everybody. Why would I like him?

1689
01:31:45,597 --> 01:31:47,906
Could you go out
with a 66-year-old woman?

1690
01:31:48,077 --> 01:31:51,956
Well, I'll tell you, she would
have to be really vibrant.

1691
01:31:53,557 --> 01:31:55,866
So vibrant she'd be spinning.

1692
01:31:57,357 --> 01:31:59,746
I'm sorry. We have no midsize
available at the moment.

1693
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:02,033
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?

1694
01:32:02,197 --> 01:32:04,950
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

1695
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:08,156
But the reservation
keeps the car here.

1696
01:32:08,317 --> 01:32:10,433
That's why you have
the reservation.

1697
01:32:10,597 --> 01:32:14,306
- I know why we have reservations.
- I don't think you do.

1698
01:32:17,637 --> 01:32:20,310
If you did, I'd have a car.

1699
01:32:20,477 --> 01:32:22,354
See, you know how to take
the reservation.

1700
01:32:22,517 --> 01:32:25,873
You just don't know how to hold
the reservation.

1701
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:30,792
And that's really the most important
part of the reservation, the holding.

1702
01:32:30,957 --> 01:32:34,472
Anybody can just take them.

1703
01:32:34,757 --> 01:32:37,430
Let me speak with my supervisor.

1704
01:32:37,597 --> 01:32:39,952
Well, here we go.

1705
01:32:40,117 --> 01:32:42,028
The supervisor.

1706
01:32:42,197 --> 01:32:43,949
- Know what she's saying over there?
- What?

1707
01:32:44,117 --> 01:32:46,995
"Hey, Marge, see those two people?
They think I'm talking to you.

1708
01:32:47,157 --> 01:32:50,433
So you pretend like you're talking
to me. Okay, now you start talking."

1709
01:32:50,597 --> 01:32:53,907
"You mean like this? So it looks like I'm
saying something, but I'm not."

1710
01:32:54,077 --> 01:32:56,272
"Say something else,
and they won't yell at me...

1711
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:58,712
...because they thought
I was checking with you."

1712
01:32:58,877 --> 01:33:01,266
"Okay, I think that's enough.
See you later."

1713
01:33:01,437 --> 01:33:04,076
I'm sorry. My supervisor says
there's nothing we can do.

1714
01:33:04,517 --> 01:33:07,350
Yeah, it looked like you were in
a real conversation over there.

1715
01:33:07,677 --> 01:33:09,952
Well, we do have a compact
if you would like that.

1716
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:11,994
- Fine.
- All right.

1717
01:33:12,157 --> 01:33:15,706
Well, we have a blue Ford Escort
for you, Mr. Seinfeld.

1718
01:33:15,877 --> 01:33:18,345
- Would you like insurance?
- Yeah, give me the insurance...

1719
01:33:18,517 --> 01:33:21,509
...because I am gonna beat
the hell out of this thing.

1720
01:33:25,157 --> 01:33:27,830
Please fill this out.

1721
01:33:28,397 --> 01:33:30,547
Do you think
I'm making a big mistake?

1722
01:33:30,717 --> 01:33:33,106
If you enjoy being with him,
that's what's important.

1723
01:33:33,277 --> 01:33:37,429
I love being with him.
I mean, I like being with him.

1724
01:33:37,597 --> 01:33:40,236
It's okay being with him.

1725
01:33:41,357 --> 01:33:44,474
- I just don't enjoy being with him.
- Well, that's what important.

1726
01:33:44,637 --> 01:33:46,673
I'm meeting him for lunch
at Chadway's.

1727
01:33:46,837 --> 01:33:50,147
Do I have to break up face to face,
or can I just do it over the phone?

1728
01:33:50,317 --> 01:33:52,308
- How many times have you been out?
- Seven.

1729
01:33:52,677 --> 01:33:54,349
Face to face.

1730
01:33:54,517 --> 01:33:56,394
Seven dates is
a face-to-face breakup?

1731
01:33:56,557 --> 01:33:59,435
If it was six, I could've let you go.

1732
01:34:00,317 --> 01:34:03,514
But seven, I'm afraid,
is over the limit.

1733
01:34:03,677 --> 01:34:06,669
Unless, of course, there was no sex.

1734
01:34:11,477 --> 01:34:13,866
How's the pasta over there?

1735
01:34:16,477 --> 01:34:18,115
What is going on out there?

1736
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:20,472
I need a bucket of water.
I got a car overheating.

1737
01:34:20,637 --> 01:34:22,070
I got an alarm that won't go off.

1738
01:34:22,237 --> 01:34:24,387
I'm pressing one.
I'm pressing two. Nothing.

1739
01:34:24,557 --> 01:34:26,548
What do I do? Help me. Help me.

1740
01:34:34,397 --> 01:34:36,149
They were supposed to do
my scene today.

1741
01:34:36,317 --> 01:34:37,670
- Today?
- Yeah.

1742
01:34:37,837 --> 01:34:41,386
They said they wanted me to walk down
the block carrying this bag of groceries.

1743
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:45,550
So I start to walk, and I trip.
And the grocery bag goes flying...

1744
01:34:45,717 --> 01:34:48,754
...and Woody starts laughing.
- He was laughing?

1745
01:34:48,917 --> 01:34:52,068
Oh, yeah. He was drinking something.
It started to come out of his nose.

1746
01:34:52,237 --> 01:34:54,705
- So then what?
- Well, I got a line in the movie!

1747
01:34:54,877 --> 01:34:57,072
- Get out!
- That's great.

1748
01:34:59,237 --> 01:35:00,955
You got a line
in a Woody Allen movie?

1749
01:35:01,437 --> 01:35:05,032
- Pretty good, huh?
- You're in the movie?

1750
01:35:05,717 --> 01:35:08,629
- Is he in the scene?
- Yeah, it's me and him.

1751
01:35:08,797 --> 01:35:10,674
I might have a new career
on my hands, huh?

1752
01:35:10,837 --> 01:35:13,829
You mean "a career."

1753
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:18,391
- So was Mia Farrow there?
- I didn't see him.

1754
01:35:20,957 --> 01:35:23,949
- What's your line?
- Well, okay, I'm there with Woody...

1755
01:35:24,117 --> 01:35:27,507
...you know. I'm at this bar,
and, you know, it's Woody Allen.

1756
01:35:27,677 --> 01:35:29,986
- Did I mention that?
- We got it. We got it.

1757
01:35:30,157 --> 01:35:33,149
And I'm sitting there with Woody,
and I turn to him and I go:

1758
01:35:33,317 --> 01:35:36,468
Boy, these pretzels
are making me thirsty.

1759
01:35:38,077 --> 01:35:42,355
- Is that how you're gonna say it?
- No, no. I'm working on it.

1760
01:35:42,997 --> 01:35:44,350
Do it like this.

1761
01:35:44,517 --> 01:35:48,146
- These pretzels are making me thirsty.
- No.

1762
01:35:48,317 --> 01:35:53,311
- These pretzels are making me thirsty.
- No, no. See, that's no good.

1763
01:35:53,477 --> 01:35:55,672
You don't know how to act.

1764
01:35:55,837 --> 01:35:57,793
These pretzels...

1765
01:35:58,717 --> 01:36:00,435
...are making me thirsty!

1766
01:36:03,997 --> 01:36:07,194
- That was no good?
- I didn't say anything.

1767
01:36:07,357 --> 01:36:09,666
All right, I'm gonna go
break up with Owen.

1768
01:36:09,837 --> 01:36:13,750
What was wrong with that?
I had a different interpretation.

1769
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:16,033
Do you know anything
about this pretzel guy?

1770
01:36:16,197 --> 01:36:18,028
Maybe he's been in the bar
a long time...

1771
01:36:18,197 --> 01:36:21,109
...and he's really depressed because
he has no job, and no woman...

1772
01:36:21,277 --> 01:36:23,029
...and he's parking cars for a living!

1773
01:36:23,197 --> 01:36:26,507
All right! All right!
Shut up! Shut up!

1774
01:36:26,677 --> 01:36:31,831
I hear you! I'm coming down!
These pretzels are making me thirsty!

1775
01:36:33,117 --> 01:36:34,835
Yeah!

1776
01:36:40,197 --> 01:36:41,550
Oh, my God.

1777
01:36:42,637 --> 01:36:44,229
Call an ambulance.

1778
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:46,706
Boy, he took it hard.

1779
01:36:48,957 --> 01:36:50,709
We were walking down the block...

1780
01:36:50,877 --> 01:36:53,675
...I was about to break up with him,
then he started to twitch.

1781
01:36:53,837 --> 01:36:57,273
Yes, I need an ambulance at 129
West 81 st Street, Apartment 5A.

1782
01:36:57,437 --> 01:36:59,507
- Tell them to hurry. Hurry!
- It's an ambulance.

1783
01:37:01,837 --> 01:37:04,431
I don't know, but he's unconscious.

1784
01:37:04,797 --> 01:37:07,436
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

1785
01:37:09,437 --> 01:37:11,314
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

1786
01:37:11,477 --> 01:37:13,308
- Kramer.
- What happened here?

1787
01:37:13,477 --> 01:37:15,945
I don't know. What should we do?
We called an ambulance.

1788
01:37:16,117 --> 01:37:18,711
- Anyone know first aid?
- Do something with the extremities.

1789
01:37:18,877 --> 01:37:20,629
- What extremities?
- What's an extremity?

1790
01:37:20,797 --> 01:37:22,628
You raise the feet,
get blood to the head.

1791
01:37:22,797 --> 01:37:24,708
You raise the head,
get blood to the feet.

1792
01:37:24,877 --> 01:37:27,345
Okay, what about a cold compress?
They always do that.

1793
01:37:27,517 --> 01:37:29,155
- I don't have a washcloth.
- Use a paper towel.

1794
01:37:29,317 --> 01:37:31,956
- You can't put that on his head.
- What about a big sponge?

1795
01:37:32,117 --> 01:37:34,028
- How you gonna hold it on there?
- Use a belt.

1796
01:37:34,197 --> 01:37:37,587
No, no, no. That'll...
It'll drip all over him.

1797
01:37:37,757 --> 01:37:39,952
- Should we walk him around?
- I've seen them do that.

1798
01:37:40,117 --> 01:37:42,551
- That's for a drug overdose.
- Maybe that's what he's got.

1799
01:37:42,717 --> 01:37:45,231
No, I just had lunch with him.
He didn't leave the table.

1800
01:37:45,397 --> 01:37:48,116
Well, he could've dropped acid
when you weren't looking.

1801
01:37:49,117 --> 01:37:50,948
He is not a drug addict.

1802
01:37:51,117 --> 01:37:53,870
Maybe he's diabetic. He might
just need a cookie or something.

1803
01:37:54,037 --> 01:37:56,346
- A cookie!
- Can you give him a cookie?

1804
01:37:56,517 --> 01:37:59,589
- How's he gonna chew it?
- Move his teeth. Worked for my uncle.

1805
01:37:59,757 --> 01:38:02,351
The sugar revived him.

1806
01:38:04,597 --> 01:38:06,713
Careful, you're getting crumbs
all over him.

1807
01:38:07,037 --> 01:38:09,756
I've got him chewing, but I don't
think he's gonna swallow.

1808
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:12,909
Let's put a few cookies in a
blender and he could drink it.

1809
01:38:13,077 --> 01:38:15,671
- Cookies don't liquefy.
- They do. You can liquefy a cookie.

1810
01:38:15,837 --> 01:38:18,226
- I'll get the blender.
- I don't have a blender.

1811
01:38:18,397 --> 01:38:20,831
- You've got a blender.
- I'd know if I had a blender.

1812
01:38:20,997 --> 01:38:23,670
Where is the ambulance?!

1813
01:38:30,837 --> 01:38:33,749
Hello, yes. I called for an ambulance
like 35 minutes ago.

1814
01:38:33,917 --> 01:38:35,794
I can't believe
what's going on out here.

1815
01:38:35,957 --> 01:38:38,949
This is an emergency.
What's taking so long?

1816
01:38:39,197 --> 01:38:41,028
Wait a second.
Maybe that's them.

1817
01:38:41,197 --> 01:38:42,471
- Hello.
- Paramedics.

1818
01:38:42,637 --> 01:38:45,276
Come on up. Okay, they're here.

1819
01:38:47,637 --> 01:38:49,946
He seems to be breathing.

1820
01:38:52,157 --> 01:38:55,035
You know, I've got to tell you,
he's a pretty good-looking guy.

1821
01:38:55,197 --> 01:38:56,391
I know.

1822
01:38:56,557 --> 01:38:59,151
Those eyebrows could use a trimming.
You ever mention that?

1823
01:38:59,317 --> 01:39:01,069
Almost.

1824
01:39:01,237 --> 01:39:03,671
I mean, because, come on,
they're running wild there.

1825
01:39:04,277 --> 01:39:07,030
- It's not an easy thing to bring up.
- Yeah, that's true.

1826
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:09,347
You should see his bathrobe, man.
It's all silk.

1827
01:39:09,517 --> 01:39:12,190
Yeah. Does he wear slippers.
I bet he wears slippers.

1828
01:39:12,357 --> 01:39:15,667
- He does. How'd you know that?
- I could tell.

1829
01:39:17,437 --> 01:39:19,155
What happened?
What took you so long?

1830
01:39:19,317 --> 01:39:21,353
We got here 20 minutes ago,
but we couldn't move.

1831
01:39:21,517 --> 01:39:24,315
The intersection is gridlocked.
I've never seen anything like it.

1832
01:39:24,477 --> 01:39:27,833
Finally we make the turn, and this guy
who was triple-parking cars...

1833
01:39:27,997 --> 01:39:31,512
...slammed into us with a blue Escort.
- Blue Escort?

1834
01:39:31,677 --> 01:39:33,907
- That's my rent-a-car!
- Oh, man.

1835
01:39:34,077 --> 01:39:35,192
What happened to the car?

1836
01:39:35,357 --> 01:39:38,588
I'm sorry. You don't know
what's going on out there!

1837
01:39:38,757 --> 01:39:39,746
Who's he?

1838
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:41,475
- This guy I'm seeing.
- What happened?

1839
01:39:41,637 --> 01:39:45,425
- We don't know.
- Who put cookies in his mouth?

1840
01:39:45,597 --> 01:39:48,475
- Cookies?
- You're not supposed to do that.

1841
01:39:48,637 --> 01:39:51,276
- So how'd you hit the car?
- I was moving it across the street.

1842
01:39:51,437 --> 01:39:54,349
I looked up and I saw Woody Allen.
I got all distracted.

1843
01:39:54,517 --> 01:39:57,953
- It's not even my car. It's a rental.
- What are you doing out there?

1844
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,233
You're holding up the production
of the movie.

1845
01:40:00,397 --> 01:40:02,513
We can't shoot, and Woody,
he's really mad at you.

1846
01:40:02,677 --> 01:40:04,952
Woody mentioned me?
What did he say?

1847
01:40:05,117 --> 01:40:08,587
He said, "Who's the moron who's got
the street all screwed up?"

1848
01:40:09,037 --> 01:40:10,675
Should I apologize to Woody?

1849
01:40:11,957 --> 01:40:13,356
All right, I'll tell you what.

1850
01:40:13,517 --> 01:40:16,668
Next time I talk to him,
maybe I'll bring it up.

1851
01:40:17,117 --> 01:40:19,108
I'll feel him out.

1852
01:40:19,677 --> 01:40:23,352
What do you think first aid was like
hundreds of years ago?

1853
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:25,348
I mean, they had no medicine,
no drugs...

1854
01:40:25,517 --> 01:40:29,066
...no technology, no equipment.
Basically, they were there first.

1855
01:40:29,237 --> 01:40:32,035
That was it. That was the whole
first aid. They sit with you.

1856
01:40:32,197 --> 01:40:34,188
That's all they could do.
"Can you help me?"

1857
01:40:34,357 --> 01:40:37,394
"No, we can't help you,
but we were the first ones here.

1858
01:40:37,557 --> 01:40:40,708
Did you see our truck?
'First aid.' That's our motto.

1859
01:40:40,877 --> 01:40:42,435
We show up before anybody."

1860
01:40:42,597 --> 01:40:44,474
You didn't say you didn't
know how to drive.

1861
01:40:44,637 --> 01:40:47,629
- Should've mentioned that.
- Well, I know how to drive.

1862
01:40:47,797 --> 01:40:49,594
Then how did all those cars
get damaged?

1863
01:40:49,757 --> 01:40:53,033
Why are people calling me up,
screaming on the phone?

1864
01:40:53,197 --> 01:40:55,995
- Most of them cancelled out on me.
- Can I get anybody anything?

1865
01:40:56,157 --> 01:40:58,034
Moving cars from one side
to the other...

1866
01:40:58,197 --> 01:41:01,269
...don't take no more sense
than putting on a pair of pants.

1867
01:41:01,437 --> 01:41:05,396
My question to you is:
Who's putting your pants on?

1868
01:41:05,637 --> 01:41:08,595
- I put my pants on, Sid.
- I don't believe you.

1869
01:41:08,757 --> 01:41:10,827
You can put your pants on,
you can move cars.

1870
01:41:10,997 --> 01:41:13,909
I don't want to get into a big
dispute about the pants.

1871
01:41:14,077 --> 01:41:16,193
Who's gonna send money to my
sister in Virginia?

1872
01:41:16,357 --> 01:41:18,154
Her little boy
needs surgery on his foot.

1873
01:41:18,517 --> 01:41:22,795
He'll be walking around with a limp,
because you can't park a few cars.

1874
01:41:23,197 --> 01:41:24,710
Maybe I could call my father.

1875
01:41:25,757 --> 01:41:29,670
- Hey, you seen the paper yet?
- Interestingly enough, no...

1876
01:41:29,837 --> 01:41:32,749
...inasmuch as it is my paper.

1877
01:41:32,917 --> 01:41:34,396
There's an article on that writer.

1878
01:41:34,557 --> 01:41:37,947
"Owen March, prominent author and
essayist, suffered a stroke yesterday...

1879
01:41:38,117 --> 01:41:40,631
...in the Upper West Side
apartment of a friend."

1880
01:41:40,797 --> 01:41:43,186
That's the guy that was here.
You're the friend.

1881
01:41:43,517 --> 01:41:47,749
Thanks. "The extent of the damage
would've been far less severe...

1882
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:50,875
...had paramedics been able
to reach him sooner."

1883
01:41:52,237 --> 01:41:54,797
- Oh, Lord.
- "The commotion also delayed...

1884
01:41:54,957 --> 01:41:58,074
...production of a Woody Allen movie
that was shooting up the block.

1885
01:41:58,517 --> 01:42:00,667
A spokeswoman
for the legendary filmmaker...

1886
01:42:00,837 --> 01:42:03,192
...said that Mr. Allen
was extremely agitated...

1887
01:42:03,357 --> 01:42:07,828
...and wondered if his days of shooting
movies in New York were over."

1888
01:42:08,037 --> 01:42:09,356
Five seconds.

1889
01:42:09,517 --> 01:42:13,112
Jerry, I was five seconds away
from breaking up with him.

1890
01:42:13,277 --> 01:42:17,828
Five seconds! The next words out
of my mouth were, "Owen, it's over."

1891
01:42:17,997 --> 01:42:21,353
- Can he communicate?
- Yeah. Well, he nods.

1892
01:42:21,517 --> 01:42:23,109
And I think he understands me.

1893
01:42:23,277 --> 01:42:25,347
He seems to enjoy it
when I read to him.

1894
01:42:26,997 --> 01:42:29,113
All right, she's free.

1895
01:42:31,397 --> 01:42:33,752
Hi, I called before.
My car got smashed.

1896
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:36,590
So listen. What should I do?
If I break up with him now...

1897
01:42:36,757 --> 01:42:40,955
...it'll look like I'm abandoning him.
I'll be ostracized from the community.

1898
01:42:41,117 --> 01:42:43,187
What community?
There's a community?

1899
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:44,676
Of course there's a community.

1900
01:42:44,837 --> 01:42:47,476
All these years, I'm living in
a community, I had no idea.

1901
01:42:47,637 --> 01:42:52,313
Sir, the estimate on the damage
to your car is $2866.

1902
01:42:52,477 --> 01:42:55,469
- I got the insurance and everything...
- Yes, now, in your report...

1903
01:42:55,637 --> 01:42:58,310
...you said you weren't the driver
at the time of the accident.

1904
01:42:58,477 --> 01:43:00,069
Somebody else was driving it.

1905
01:43:00,237 --> 01:43:04,150
All right, well, sir, you're only covered
for when you're driving the car.

1906
01:43:04,317 --> 01:43:06,547
What's that?

1907
01:43:06,717 --> 01:43:10,073
- You're not covered for other drivers.
- Other drivers?

1908
01:43:10,237 --> 01:43:13,115
Your whole business is based
on other drivers. It's a rented car.

1909
01:43:13,277 --> 01:43:15,586
That's who's driving it.
Other drivers.

1910
01:43:15,757 --> 01:43:17,588
Doesn't my credit card cover me?

1911
01:43:17,757 --> 01:43:20,271
- Not that particular one.
- I got a hundred cards.

1912
01:43:20,437 --> 01:43:23,031
Here, here. Pick a card.
Take any card you want.

1913
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:24,789
Go ahead. Whichever one.
I don't care.

1914
01:43:24,957 --> 01:43:28,916
- lf you had read the rental agreement...
- Did you see the size of that document?

1915
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:31,716
It's like the Declaration of
Independence. Who's gonna read that?

1916
01:43:31,877 --> 01:43:35,426
Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now,
you are not covered for that damage...

1917
01:43:35,597 --> 01:43:39,909
...and there is absolutely nothing
that can be done about that.

1918
01:43:40,717 --> 01:43:43,948
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

1919
01:43:51,477 --> 01:43:53,786
It's good, isn't it?

1920
01:43:54,357 --> 01:43:56,393
Yankee bean.

1921
01:43:57,197 --> 01:43:59,552
Why Yankee bean, huh?

1922
01:43:59,717 --> 01:44:02,834
Don't they have beans
in the South?

1923
01:44:02,997 --> 01:44:06,034
I mean, if you order Yankee bean
in the South, are they offended?

1924
01:44:09,517 --> 01:44:12,907
Yank ee bean. Yank ee bean.

1925
01:44:13,517 --> 01:44:19,433
I lik e my Yank ee bean.

1926
01:44:28,037 --> 01:44:29,595
Owen...

1927
01:44:34,717 --> 01:44:37,311
...I think we have to talk.

1928
01:44:37,477 --> 01:44:40,469
I mean, I have to talk.

1929
01:44:40,797 --> 01:44:45,917
It would be nice if we could,
but, you know, whatever.

1930
01:44:48,637 --> 01:44:53,313
Don't get me wrong.
I like coming here and feeding you...

1931
01:44:53,477 --> 01:44:56,947
...and cleaning a little,
and paying your bills.

1932
01:44:57,117 --> 01:45:00,348
I mean, that's good stuff.
Good stuff.

1933
01:45:02,397 --> 01:45:06,834
I have a wonderful time when
I'm with you. Wonderful!

1934
01:45:07,837 --> 01:45:11,113
But at this point in my life,
I'm not really sure...

1935
01:45:11,277 --> 01:45:15,793
...that I'm ready to make
a commitment to one person.

1936
01:45:15,957 --> 01:45:19,154
I'm just not really sure that we
have enough in common.

1937
01:45:19,317 --> 01:45:21,956
I mean, for example:

1938
01:45:22,117 --> 01:45:25,268
I like running in the park...

1939
01:45:25,437 --> 01:45:26,870
...bicycling...

1940
01:45:27,037 --> 01:45:31,588
...roller-skating,
tennis and skiing...

1941
01:45:31,757 --> 01:45:34,066
And, well...

1942
01:45:34,237 --> 01:45:37,274
I'm gonna be brutally honest
with you now.

1943
01:45:37,557 --> 01:45:41,232
It's a bitch to get here.
It's two subways.

1944
01:45:41,397 --> 01:45:44,469
I have to transfer at 42nd Street
to take the double-R.

1945
01:45:46,157 --> 01:45:49,786
Anyway, I mean, this doesn't
mean we can't be friends.

1946
01:45:52,117 --> 01:45:55,029
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

1947
01:46:00,477 --> 01:46:02,547
Can you die from an odour?

1948
01:46:03,277 --> 01:46:06,269
I mean, if you were locked in
a vomitorium for two weeks...

1949
01:46:06,437 --> 01:46:10,555
...could you die from the odour?
- An overdose of odour. Good question.

1950
01:46:10,997 --> 01:46:13,192
Do I smell?

1951
01:46:14,357 --> 01:46:17,747
No, no, no. I was just down
at the 42nd Street subway today.

1952
01:46:17,917 --> 01:46:20,272
It is disgusting.

1953
01:46:20,437 --> 01:46:23,190
Guess who I bumped into? Owen.

1954
01:46:23,357 --> 01:46:26,235
- He's all right?
- Yeah, he's almost fully recovered.

1955
01:46:26,397 --> 01:46:29,116
Told me he
was just using me for sex.

1956
01:46:31,357 --> 01:46:32,585
- Let me get that.
- I got it.

1957
01:46:32,757 --> 01:46:35,032
- Please.
- Let me. I smashed your car.

1958
01:46:35,197 --> 01:46:36,755
It cost you over $2000.

1959
01:46:36,917 --> 01:46:39,829
Yeah, a cup of coffee
should cover it.

1960
01:46:41,277 --> 01:46:44,394
- Oh, man.
- What are you doing here?

1961
01:46:44,557 --> 01:46:45,751
I got fired from the movie.

1962
01:46:45,917 --> 01:46:47,509
- Get out of here. What?
- What?

1963
01:46:47,677 --> 01:46:50,191
Well, you know, they were
going to shoot it today.

1964
01:46:50,357 --> 01:46:53,667
We rehearsed it twice,
and then Woody yells, "Action."

1965
01:46:53,837 --> 01:46:55,190
I turn to him and I say:

1966
01:46:55,357 --> 01:46:57,268
"These pretzels are making
me thirsty."

1967
01:46:57,437 --> 01:46:59,712
- Right.
- Then I took a swig of beer...

1968
01:46:59,877 --> 01:47:03,506
...and I slammed the glass down
on the bar, and it shattered.

1969
01:47:04,917 --> 01:47:08,705
Well, one of the pieces
must've hit Woody...

1970
01:47:09,357 --> 01:47:11,473
...and he started crying.

1971
01:47:11,637 --> 01:47:14,754
And he yells out, "I'm bleeding,"
and he runs off.

1972
01:47:14,917 --> 01:47:19,069
Anyway, this woman, she came up
to me, and she says, "You're fired."

1973
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:21,508
Boy, I really nailed that scene.

1974
01:47:26,717 --> 01:47:28,230
Oh, wait a...

1975
01:47:29,277 --> 01:47:32,428
Oh, for crying out loud.

1976
01:47:40,917 --> 01:47:43,306
The best part of a relationship
is when you're sick.

1977
01:47:43,637 --> 01:47:46,231
The best part of being sick
is when you're in a relationship.

1978
01:47:46,397 --> 01:47:48,308
But if I got married,
you know those vows...

1979
01:47:48,477 --> 01:47:50,707
...for richer or for poorer,
for better or for worse.

1980
01:47:50,877 --> 01:47:53,596
All I need is the sickness.
That is the most important one.

1981
01:47:53,757 --> 01:47:57,750
"Do you take this man in sickness?"

1982
01:47:57,917 --> 01:47:59,509
That's the time
I need somebody there.

1983
01:47:59,677 --> 01:48:01,713
The rest of the time,
go out, have a ball.

1984
01:48:01,877 --> 01:48:04,835
But if I get the sniffles,
you better be there.

1985
01:48:17,677 --> 01:48:19,668
