1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,606
So, what happened with
with the auto show?

2
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,073
-I waited for you. You never came.
-Oh, I'm sorry. I got really busy.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,838
-How long did you wait?
-Five minutes.

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:18,409
-Five minutes? That's it?
-No difference. You never showed up.

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,212
Well, I could have.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:24,448
I mean, last week we waited for that
friend of Kramer's for like 40 minutes.

7
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,114
We barely knew the guy.

8
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,920
The longer you know someone,
the shorter you wait for them?

9
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,223
-That's the way it works.
-When did you tell George to be here?

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,765
Told him to meet in 1 0 minutes.
How long has it been?

11
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,697
-About five.
-That's enough.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,132
Yeah.

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,674
Early. All right.

14
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,985
Cold.

15
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,289
So I noticed you bounced
a check at the bodega.

16
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,292
-How did you know about that?
-Marcelino.

17
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,559
He taped it up on his cash register
with all of the other bad checks.

18
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,258
He can't do that.

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,461
It's the only way you'll learn.

20
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,770
Oh, these eggs are disgusting.

21
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,306
Boy, this chicken should be
ashamed of himself.

22
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:25,144
-Fantastic thing, fantastic.
-What happened?

23
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,617
Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth
and this piece of apple skin...

24
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:32,246
...that must have been lodged
in there for days...comes loose.

25
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,155
-Fantastic.
-Then I'm at the foundation--

26
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,455
-You're still doing that?
-Once in a while.

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,619
When you feel guilty.

28
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,323
No, occasionally I forget
to let the machine pick up.

29
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,493
Anyway, they made this large donation
to a woman's prison...

30
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,333
...and I get to go down there
and check it out.

31
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,031
-That's caged heat.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,200
-What are you doing there?
-Nothing.

33
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,675
Just, you know,
stroll around the cellblocks...

34
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,974
...maybe take in a shower fight.

35
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,115
You got a bounced check
hanging up in the market...

36
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,948
-...over on Columbus.
-Yes, I know. I know.

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,685
I noticed you chose
the clowns-with-balloon check design.

38
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,125
It was a mistake.
The bank sent me the wrong ones.

39
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,722
Hey, look who's here.

40
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,697
Hey, Kurt, this is Jerry
and George and Kramer.

41
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,305
-Hey.
-Hey, Kurt, taste these eggs.

42
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,202
No, I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.

43
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,607
Yes. These are sweatshop eggs.

44
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,854
I gotta call the office, honey.
Will you order for me?

45
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,292
I'm a honey.

46
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,160
He's pretty great, huh?

47
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,558
Is he from the future?

48
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,233
No, he just shaves his head.
I think it's pretty gutsy.

49
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,673
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you
a little something about guts.

50
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,207
This is guts.

51
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,210
What? Clinging to some scraps?

52
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,344
These are not scraps.

53
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:10,182
These are historic remains
of a once-great society of hair.

54
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,619
Did you guys stop
at the bodega today?

55
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:17,024
Some moron bounced
a clown check.

56
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,628
I'm really sorry
about the check, Marcelino.

57
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,596
People seem to like the clowns.

58
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,170
Look, let me just give you the 40,
plus another 20 for your trouble.

59
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,870
Okay.

60
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:43,116
-Are you gonna take the check down?
-Sorry, no. Store policy.

61
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,123
-But it's your bodega.
-Even I am not above the policy.

62
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,725
-And those are our tennis courts.
-Tennis courts?

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,301
What about the yard?
Where do they have the gang fights?

64
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,736
There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza.
This is a minimum-security facility.

65
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,367
What about a hole?

66
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,002
-Do you ever put anybody in the box?
-No.

67
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,477
This prison stinks.

68
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,778
And finally the library,
which has just been refurbished...

69
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,716
...thanks to your generous donation.

70
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,686
-This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.
-Nice to meet you.

71
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,292
-I'll be in my office if you need me.
-Thanks, warden.

72
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,019
Betsy.

73
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,191
Betsy.

74
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,529
So are you the head
of the foundation?

75
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:34,230
Well, let's just say
it wouldn't exist without me.

76
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,705
So you two shop at the same store?

77
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,870
No, it's standard issue.

78
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,383
Oh, my God. You're in jail?

79
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,178
That is so cool.

80
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,684
You asked her out?

81
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,764
Well, not out. She's a prisoner.

82
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,034
-How could you ask her out?
-Why not?

83
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,137
You wouldn't date
that girl from Queens...

84
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,501
...because you didn't want
to go over the bridge.

85
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,609
-lt was different.
-I'll say.

86
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,836
Jerry, I like being with her.

87
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,209
Plus, I know where she is
all the time.

88
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,575
I have relatively no competition.

89
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,653
And you know
how you fear the pop-in?

90
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,187
-The pop-in.
-No pop-in...

91
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,588
...no, "ln the neighborhood."
No, "l saw your light was on."

92
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,228
And the best part is,
if things go really well....

93
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,194
-Conjugal visit?
-Don't jinx it. Don't.

94
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,356
-Hey.
-Hey.

95
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,163
-What's up?
-George is dating a convict.

96
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,238
-What's she in for?
-Embezzlement.

97
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,533
Sounds like a nice girl.

98
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,868
Is it all right if I put some stuff
in your fridge? Mine's full.

99
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,171
Yeah, sure.

100
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,111
-You don't even have a fridge, do you?
-Well, not here.

101
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,846
-Okay.
-Kramer....

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,079
Wait a minute. Wait.
What the hell is that?

103
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,120
Well, it's chicken feed.

104
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,388
I sense something is afoot.

105
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,729
Yeah, I bought a chicken.

106
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,325
Allow me.

107
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,566
Why?

108
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,940
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.

109
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,240
Allow me.

110
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,640
-What are you? An idiot?
-No.

111
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,804
Hold it. Hold it.
Here. I got it. Catch.

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,054
Hey, driver's license.

113
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,519
Oh, my God.

114
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,890
-What?
-Your hair.

115
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,463
It's so thick and lustrous.

116
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,798
I mean, it was.

117
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,300
Well, it still is.

118
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,563
I shaved my head
for my swim team.

119
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,969
I just liked the way it looked,
so I kept it.

120
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:53,236
Are you saying
that I could be dating this hair?

121
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,813
I mean, with you under it?

122
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,193
Hey.

123
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,631
Is that your chicken
making all that noise?

124
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,135
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.

125
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,339
-Who?
-Little Jerry Seinfeld.

126
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,805
-I named my chicken after you.
-Thanks.

127
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,708
That's very sweet.
But that's not a chicken.

128
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,816
Of course it is.
I picked it out myself.

129
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,679
Well, you picked out a rooster.

130
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,215
Well, that would explain
Little Jerry's poor egg production.

131
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,964
-This was fun.
-Yeah, I had a great time.

132
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,797
Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.

133
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,439
The whole hour just flew by.

134
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,804
-I'll get that.
-Thanks, Bobby.

135
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,208
Well, I guess
I'll see you in four days.

136
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,575
Yeah. Go out
and have a ball with the guys.

137
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,740
I'll be waiting right here for you.

138
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,148
Of course you will.

139
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,754
You're the best.

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,294
-Hello.
-Jerry...

141
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,258
...Leo told us
he saw your bounced check.

142
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,196
-Are you having money problems?
-I'm not having money problems.

143
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,267
Enough with the comedy.
You're very clever.

144
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,267
You should look into advertising.

145
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,930
He never even called Ed Roydlick.
They were looking for someone.

146
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,770
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick.
I'm doing fine.

147
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,572
That's it. I'm gonna send you $50.

148
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,578
You are not sending me $50.

149
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,343
We're sending you $50.
Morty, get me an envelope.

150
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,853
I swear to God, if you send me $50,
you are gonna be so sorry.

151
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,821
-I don't see envelopes.
-They're right in front of you.

152
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,689
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Let me show you.

153
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,764
Ma, Ma, Ma!

154
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,603
-How are the folks?
-Good.

155
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,935
-So movie tonight?
-I thought you were going with Celia.

156
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,599
I did. I'm back.

157
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,371
I love this relationship.
I feel so liberated.

158
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,780
Having her in jail?

159
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,248
Yeah, the only thing that bothers me
is I'm just coming up with this now.

160
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,453
Yeah, dating a convicted felon.
I don't know how you missed it.

161
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,386
Here. Take a look at that.

162
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,723
Kurt's an organ donor.

163
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,963
No, he's not bald.

164
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,101
Look, he's got a full head of hair.

165
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,463
So he just shaves his head
for no reason?

166
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,401
That's like using a wheelchair
for the fun of it.

167
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,566
And he's growing it in just for me.

168
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,678
It's mine. It's all mine.

169
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,976
-It's just hair.
-No, it's not just hair. Look.

170
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:50,487
-It's brown.
-It's chestnut with auburn highlights.

171
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,347
-So?
-You know, you're not around women.

172
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:58,020
You don't know how important
a man's hair is.

173
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,996
I'm sorry, George, but it's true.

174
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,866
I knew it.

175
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,636
Hey.

176
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,445
-Hey, Kramer, nice rooster.
-Yeah.

177
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,142
-What's his name?
-Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.

178
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:25,222
Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Does he bounce checks?

179
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,893
Look, can't you take
Jerry's check down?

180
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,391
Sorry, Kramer, can't help you.

181
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,724
Hey, hey, Jerry. Come on.

182
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,195
Oh, sorry.

183
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,962
-I like the way he handles himself.
-Oh, yeah.

184
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,741
-Oh, it's coming in already.
-Yeah.

185
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:53,783
Wow, you have some
very nice little seedlings here.

186
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,481
-What?
-Well, it doesn't seem...

187
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,891
...to be coming in
so good over here or here.

188
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,393
-What do you mean?
-Well, I don't know.

189
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,831
How long have you been shaving
your head for?

190
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,800
About three years.

191
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,764
Oh, my God.

192
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,334
I'm going bald.

193
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,909
George, I'm so glad to see you.

194
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,313
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes.

195
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,510
You buy
yourself something nice.

196
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,418
Good news. I'm up for parole.

197
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:39,223
Parole? That's dynamite.

198
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,925
Marcelino's taking down the check?

199
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,594
Yeah, well, it comes down if Little
Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.

200
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,137
Great.

201
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,038
What?

202
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,440
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights
in the back of his store.

203
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,046
Yeah, so he says
if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins...

204
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,910
...the check comes down.

205
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,642
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.

206
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,719
Only in the United States.

207
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,549
-It's inhumane.
-No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.

208
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,215
It's two roosters pecking
at each other.

209
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,726
-What?
-Yeah.

210
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,856
Well, I thought
they wore gloves and helmets.

211
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,467
You know,
like American Gladiators.

212
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,796
No, Kramer,
Little Jerry could get hurt.

213
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,438
Well, I left him with Marcelino.

214
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,305
My Little Jerry.

215
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,150
Hey, did you get Little Jerry?
Is he okay?

216
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,912
Oh, well, he's more than okay.
He won.

217
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,350
-You let him fight?
-I couldn't get there in time to stop it.

218
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,458
But you should've seen
Little Jerry, Jerry.

219
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,789
Flapping his wings
and strutting his stuff.

220
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:48,559
He was pecking and weaving
and bobbing and talking trash.

221
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,033
He didn't even have to touch him.
The other rooster ran out of the ring.

222
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,136
The whole fight lasted two seconds.

223
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,003
-How long do they usually last?
-Five seconds.

224
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,441
Marcelino says he's taking
your check down today.

225
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,877
-Great.
-Hey.

226
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,017
-Celia is up for parole.
-Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.

227
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,619
-What?
-Who?

228
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,616
I'm too tired.

229
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,350
Listen. I want you to come by later.
All right?

230
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,358
-We're having a victory party.
-Okay.

231
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,027
It's over, Jerry. She's getting out.

232
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,725
I'm so sorry.

233
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,628
She's been locked up for two years.

234
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,707
She's gonna want to make up
for lost time.

235
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,504
Dinners, movies, talking.

236
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,811
In other words,
a normal relationship.

237
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,374
That's no good.

238
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,054
I've tried it straight, Jerry.
We've all seen the results.

239
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,713
I think for me...

240
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,027
...sick is the only way to go.

241
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,220
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.

242
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,228
It's not the same.

243
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,129
Hey, if you two
were meant to be together...

244
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,668
...I'm sure the cops
will pick her up on something.

245
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,935
Kurt?

246
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,014
What's with the sweats?
Aren't we going out?

247
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,240
I don't care.

248
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,050
You got a big stain on your shirt.

249
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,918
Oh, yeah, a meatball
fell out of my sandwich.

250
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,718
You already ate?

251
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,758
It's from yesterday.

252
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,261
Jerry, you missed a hell
of a cockfight last night.

253
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,233
Then what is my check still doing up?
We had a deal.

254
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,634
-Now we have a new deal.
-New deal?

255
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,607
When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine,
the check will be yours.

256
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,870
This is outrageous.

257
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,274
Pack of Juicy Fruit.

258
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,643
-Eighty-five cents.
-Eighty-five cents?

259
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,910
That is outrageous.

260
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,820
Kramer, Marcelino wants us
to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.

261
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,482
Well, that's out of the question.

262
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,254
But cockfighting is
an illegal and immoral activity.

263
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,264
Yeah, if you've got a loser.
But Little Jerry was born to cockfight.

264
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,924
No, no more cockfighting.

265
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,004
Let's just sell him to Marcelino
and be done with it.

266
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,799
-I think you're jealous.
-Of what?

267
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:15,304
Yeah, you see in Little Jerry Seinfeld
the unlimited future you once had.

268
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,279
Now, just because
Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been...

269
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,941
...don't make
Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was.

270
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,588
-Kramer, give me that rooster.
-No more! You hate him...

271
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,850
...because he's doing more
with your name than you ever will!

272
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,361
George, Celia has listed you
as a character reference.

273
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:39,971
Whatever you can tell us would be
helpful in her getting parole.

274
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,169
Well, anything I could do to help.

275
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:49,542
She's a wonderful girl.
Very smart, very crafty.

276
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,343
Does she have any plans
after she's released?

277
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,452
Plans. Schemes.

278
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,851
She keeps talking about getting
back together with her old friends.

279
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,958
You know, "the gang,"
she likes to call them.

280
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,527
Yeah, they're hatching something.
You can count on that.

281
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:12,029
Jerry, tomorrow night is fight night.
Where's my rooster?

282
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,570
-Kramer won't sell.
-Tell you what I'm going to do.

283
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,503
I'm gonna take down
your check anyway.

284
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,006
Well, thank you, Marcelino.

285
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:21,044
Well, perhaps some day
you will do me a favor.

286
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,510
And that day is today.

287
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,711
Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down...

288
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,318
...in the third round
of tomorrow's main event.

289
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,217
-You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
-Not so loud.

290
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,359
First of all, I don't think
you can make a rooster take a dive.

291
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,756
-Can too.
-Second of all...

292
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,590
...Jerry Seinfeld, big or little...

293
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,232
...doesn't go down for anyone,
anywhere, at any time.

294
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,561
Now, I'd appreciate it
if you'd please leave.

295
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,297
Big Jerry is making
a big mistake, Jerry.

296
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,373
We'll see about that.

297
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,211
Kramer, I'm coming up.
We got a cockfight to win.

298
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,712
Okay.

299
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:01,018
Elaine said you would be
the best person I could talk to.

300
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:05,245
Yeah, classic horseshoe pattern.

301
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,448
-I've seen a lot of this.
-Oh, God.

302
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,753
No, no, Kurt, wrong attitude.

303
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,294
-You should be happy.
-Happy? Why should I be happy?

304
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,455
You've still got
pretty good coverage.

305
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:18,694
Once the enemy advances
beyond this perimeter...

306
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,935
...then you won't be Kurt anymore.

307
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,300
What will I be?

308
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:34,642
-How long do I have?
-Fourteen months, maybe 1 0.

309
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,516
-ls there anything I can do?
-Yes...

310
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,551
...Iive, damn it.

311
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,788
Live every precious moment as
if this was the last year of your life...

312
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,658
...because in many ways...

313
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,791
...it is.

314
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,695
Excuse me.

315
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,735
Celia, what are you doing here?

316
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,471
Well, I didn't get my parole,
so I busted out.

317
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,774
And you just decided to pop in?

318
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,458
-Kurt.
-Elaine, will you marry me?

319
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,890
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

320
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,499
-Boy, he's looking good, huh, Jerry?
-Yeah.

321
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,229
All right.
I think that's enough for today.

322
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,472
Little Jerry is a lean, mean,
pecking machine.

323
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,741
-What are you doing with that?
-I'm just going to heat this up.

324
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,007
Make a little hot tub for Little Jerry.

325
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,241
Hey, Kramer...

326
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,712
-...be careful.
-Yeah.

327
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,886
-Hey.
-Hey, guess what.

328
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,151
Little Jerry ran from here
to Newman's in under 30 seconds.

329
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,818
-ls that good?
-I don't know.

330
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,526
-Where have you been?
-Celia broke out of prison.

331
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,359
I'm sitting at home,
she shows up at the door.

332
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:01,302
-Oh, my God, the break out pop-in.
-Yeah.

333
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,701
And, Jerry, listen to this.

334
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,776
I've discovered something better
than conjugal-visit sex.

335
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,071
Fugitive sex.

336
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,805
-It's like every time--
-George.

337
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,110
This is a little too much for me.
Escape convicts, fugitive sex....

338
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,752
I got a cockfight to focus on.

339
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,759
Hey, hey, Kurt, slow down.

340
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,396
I can't just marry you.

341
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,397
I mean, I need some fiancée time.

342
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,764
I need some
make-my-girlfriends-jealous time.

343
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,564
Plus, you want to get to know me.

344
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,731
Yeah, yeah, that too.

345
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,504
-Well, how much time?
-I don't know. A year?

346
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,271
No, no, no, it has to be now.

347
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,940
Could I see the ring again?

348
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,548
So you're actually considering it?

349
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,024
Well, it will be a couple of years
before he's completely bald.

350
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,629
Those will be good times.

351
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,766
Marriage is a big step, Elaine.
Your life will totally change.

352
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,903
Jerry, it's 3:30 in the morning.
I'm at a cockfight.

353
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,731
What am I clinging to?

354
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,163
Hey.

355
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,934
-Sorry I'm late.
-Where's Celia?

356
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,443
She didn't want to come.
She's not really into sports.

357
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,716
-Hey, how's he doing?
-Well, he's got a big sweat going.

358
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,479
Oh, this came for you Express Mail.
It's from your parents.

359
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,848
-Hi.
-Hi.

360
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,616
"Fifty dollars."
I don't believe this.

361
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,353
There's Marcelino.

362
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,160
Look at the size of his bird.

363
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,825
That looks like a dog
with a glove on his head.

364
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,271
Hi, is George back
from the cockfight yet?

365
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,569
I've got to thank him.
He changed my life.

366
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,609
No. Must've been a good fight.
Not back.

367
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,768
Damn.

368
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,579
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza.

369
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,911
Well, well, well, look who's here.

370
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,314
Oh, man.

371
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,250
Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest...

372
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,788
...for aiding and abetting
a known fugitive.

373
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,188
-I'm not George Costanza.
-Save it.

374
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,127
We know you're bald.
We know it's you. Let's go.

375
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,659
Okay. I got the whole scoop.

376
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,270
Marcelino flew the bird in
from Ecuador.

377
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,963
-He's 68-0.
-He's a ringer.

378
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,631
Where's the tamale guy?

379
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,242
Little Jerry's gonna get
his clock cleaned.

380
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,507
I've got to get him out of there.

381
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,514
Little Jerry!

382
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,748
Kramer!

383
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,723
Stop the fight!

384
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:43,164
Tamale!

385
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,883
Why? Why'd you get into
a fistfight with the cop?

386
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,459
-You were innocent.
-They thought I was George.

387
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,619
I'm not that bald.

388
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:15,494
And I have too little time left
to take that crap, so I slugged him.

389
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,992
How long are you
gonna be in here for?

390
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,766
Well, my lawyer says 1 4 months,
but with good behavior maybe 1 0.

391
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,343
-So 1 0 to 1 4 months?
-Yeah.
