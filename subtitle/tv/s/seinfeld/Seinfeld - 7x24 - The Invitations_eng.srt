1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,596
If wedding invitations
were left up to men...

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,433
...we'd just drive around
sticking fliers in windshields.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,989
Not even typed up either.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,674
Just magic markers,
xeroxed, you know:

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,558
"Party."

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,035
What's needed
is a divorce announcement.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,919
"Mr. and Mrs. Fred Johnson
request the honour of your presence...

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,632
...at the returning of their daughter
back to Mr. and Mrs. Fred Johnson."

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,752
- Hi.
- Hi, can I help you?

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,435
- Yes, we'd like wedding invitations.
- Oh, well, congratulations.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,874
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,234
- When's the wedding?
- June.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,030
- Late June.
- We have quite a few to pick from.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,556
They're arranged in order of price.
The most expensive are in the front.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,312
I don't know, what about this one?

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,789
To tell you the truth, they haven't
made those for a number of years.

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,315
I might have some boxes
in our warehouse in New Jersey.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,119
- I'd have to check.
- Oh, no. George, that's so ugly.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,633
We don't want that.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,872
What's the difference?
You just read it and mail it right back.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,235
- These ones.
- Why don't they make them anymore?

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,188
Well, for one thing,
the glue isn't very adhesive.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,510
It takes a lot of moisture
to make them stick.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,075
So we pick up some Elmer's.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,513
All right.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,597
Do you see what I do for you?

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,118
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, George.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,354
- Lilly.
- No, Susan.

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,557
- No, no, it's Lilly.
- I think I know my own name.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,948
It's Susan.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,797
Well, you look like a Lilly.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,193
It's coming, Jerry, it's coming.

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,999
- What's coming?
- The day.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,991
The day.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,799
We ordered
the wedding invitations today.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,599
Nothing can stop it now, nothing.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,395
It's here. It's happening.

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,791
Can I do this? I can't do this.
Look at me. Look at me, I can't do this.

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,916
I can't do it.
Help me, Jerry, help me.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,514
Just break it off with her.
Tell her it's over.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,474
I can't.

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,392
- Why not?
- Because I can't face that scene.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,471
You know what kind of a scene
that would be?

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,598
I'd rather be unhappy for the rest
of my life than to go through that.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,514
I can't. I've tried to psych myself up
a million times. I can't go through that.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,591
All right, take it easy.
Just take it easy.

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,035
- What about a letter?
- A letter?

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,156
I write a letter
and then I go to China.

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,115
I disappear in a sea of people
for, like, six months, a year.

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,953
You know,
just while things simmer down.

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,512
"Dear Susan, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,671
I made a terrible mistake.

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,116
I'm really, really sorry."

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,958
- That's it?
- What, too short?

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,236
- Seems a little short, yeah.
- A little short.

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,590
You can't go to China.
What about your job?

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,115
Right. My job.

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,589
So write a letter
and move to Staten Island.

59
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,752
It's easier to blend into a sea of people
in Staten Island than China.

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,273
Yeah, yeah. Staten Island.

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,956
- How do I get the rest of my clothes?
- You come back for your clothes.

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,998
- I'm not going back in there.
- So forget about your clothes.

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,756
Well, I'm not starting up
a whole new wardrobe now!

64
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,071
Freedom and no clothes is a lot better
than no freedom with clothes.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,551
If she would just
take a plane somewhere.

66
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,994
And what, hope for a crash?

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,235
It happens.

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,755
Do you know the odds on a crash?
It's a million to one.

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,034
It's something. It's hope.

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,719
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,757
Georgie, you know
what I just realized?

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,197
The wedding is like a month away.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,193
- Elaine.
- What?

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,318
Oh, by the way, what am I gonna
get to be in the wedding party?

75
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,110
- What do you mean?
- Jerry's gonna be best man...

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,350
...and Kramer's the usher.
What am I gonna be?

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,113
I don't think you're anything.

78
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,592
Well, I have to be something.
I'm a close friend.

79
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,793
- What about being a bridesmaid?
- Well, those are Susan's friends.

80
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,398
- Then how about being an usher?
- All right, I'll ask Susan about it later.

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,916
You don't ask. You tell.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,991
What about the letter?
Should I think about it?

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,390
Elaine, if a guy wanted
to end a relationship...

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,629
...what could he do?

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,592
Start smoking.

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,952
Smoking.

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,395
- Does she hate cigarettes?
- Yes, she hates cigarettes.

88
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,632
But you don't smoke.

89
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,117
No.

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,839
You know, I think I'm getting
depressed about George's wedding.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
- Really?
- Yeah, once he gets married, that's it.

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,188
She'll probably get pregnant.
They'll move to Westchester.

93
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,158
- I'll never see him again.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,993
- Then it'll be just me, you and Kramer.
- No, not me, pal.

95
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,628
I can't keep this up much longer.
I'm sick of being single.

96
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,268
- I'm getting out.
- So it's just gonna be me and Kramer?

97
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,556
Yeah, just you and Kramer.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,119
See you.

99
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,951
Me and Kramer.

100
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,355
Hey, buddy.

101
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,991
Hey, I thought of
a great invention for driving.

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,118
A periscope in a car,
so you can see traffic.

103
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,554
How are you gonna drive...

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,029
...while you're
looking through a periscope?

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,838
Besides which, it's not a submarine.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,956
There's no room for a periscope
on a car.

107
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,839
- Oh, you make a higher roof.
- They're not making higher roofs.

108
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,758
Well, why can't you
make a higher roof?

109
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,311
Because it's a stupid idea.

110
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,631
No one's gonna go for it.
Don't you understand? It's stupid!

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,998
Stupid. It's stupid.

112
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,833
Hey, hey, hey, look out!

113
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,916
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

114
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,674
Yeah, thanks.

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,717
Oh, my God. You saved my life.

116
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,599
Shouldn't there be
some kind of reward for that?

117
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,392
You should be careful
crossing the street.

118
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,676
Otherwise you could die,
if that bothers you.

119
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,597
- Well, yeah...
- See? To me, this is a waste.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,831
- What?
- The shirt under your sweater.

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,752
It sits in a drawer for three weeks...

122
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,071
...and when it finally comes out,
it only sticks up out of your collar.

123
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,431
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
- Jeannie Steinman.

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,355
- Same initials. How do you like that?
- I like it.

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,790
Listen, I was talking to Elaine today,
and she said...

126
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,520
...that she would really like
to be an usher at the wedding.

127
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,191
No, out of the question.

128
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,351
I don't want any women ushers
at my wedding.

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,751
And while we're on the subject,
Kramer's not an usher either.

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,388
- Why not?
- He doesn't even know my name.

131
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,394
- That was an honest mistake.
- No, he's too weird.

132
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,994
He'd fall or something.
He'd ruin the whole ceremony.

133
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,550
Yeah, you're probably right.

134
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,632
What are you doing?

135
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,679
Since when do you smoke?

136
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,191
I've always smoked.

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,032
- I've never seen you smoke.
- Oh, yeah, well, big smoker.

138
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,993
I gave it up for a while,
but it was too tough.

139
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,675
You know, I don't got the willpower.

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,391
- Oh, I don't like this one bit.
- Well, I can't stop now.

141
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,599
I'm addicted.
They've gotten a hold on me.

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,872
Well, you are gonna have to quit.

143
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,398
- Menus?
- No, I know what I want.

144
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,788
- The usual?
- Yeah.

145
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,394
- And for you?
- A bowl of Cheerios, not too much milk.

146
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,152
Okay, two bowls of Cheerios.

147
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,873
- You too?
- Yeah.

148
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,913
Hey, did you hear
the bank on the corner...

149
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,755
...is offering $100 if you go in there
and they don't greet you with a "hello."

150
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,639
Oh, really? That's nice.

151
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,308
- Come on. What's with you?
- I think I'm in love.

152
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,237
Oh, come on.

153
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,875
No, it's true.
This woman saved my life.

154
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,270
I was crossing the street.
I was almost hit by a car.

155
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,634
And then we talked...

156
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,155
...and the whole thing
just seemed like a dream.

157
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,551
If a guy saved your life,
you'd be in love with him too.

158
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,431
No, this woman is different.
She's incredible.

159
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,832
She's just like me.
She talks like me. She acts like me.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,549
She ordered cereal in a restaurant.
We even have the same initials.

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,069
- Wait, I just realized what's going on.
- What?

162
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,913
Now I know what I've been
looking for all these years.

163
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,672
Myself.

164
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,311
I've been waiting
for me to come along.

165
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,438
And now I've swept myself
off my feet.

166
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,556
Will you stop it, man?
You're freaking me out.

167
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,438
Jeez.

168
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,394
- Hey.
- Hey.

169
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,712
- Wait a second, you didn't say "hello."
- Yes, I did.

170
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,155
No. No, you didn't.
Hundred dollars. I get $100.

171
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,675
- No, no, I said "hello."
- No, no, you said "hey."

172
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,990
Well, "hey" is "hello." Same thing.

173
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,232
The ad said the bank will pay $100
if you're not greeted with a "hello."

174
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,550
You're taking that much too literally.

175
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,676
Now, sir, do you have
any business to transact?

176
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,149
- I wanna speak with the manager.
- He's not here.

177
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,278
Then I'll be back.

178
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,151
- So I'm not gonna be an usher?
- No.

179
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,913
So I'm nothing?

180
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,039
Jerry is best man,
Kramer is an usher, and I am nothing?

181
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,954
- Kramer's not an usher anymore.
- What are you talking about?

182
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,872
- You've been demoted.
- Why?

183
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,031
Because you called her
by the wrong name.

184
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,069
But she really looks like a Lilly.

185
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,635
Jerry. Hey, Jerry, Susan says
I can't be an usher at the wedding.

186
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,233
Yeah, me neither.

187
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,550
George, I wanna bring a date
to the wedding.

188
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,790
- Who?
- I just met her. She's incredible.

189
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,758
Oh, this is great!

190
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,038
Now I'm gonna be stuck
at the singles' table with all the losers?

191
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,794
- You can go with Kramer.
- No, no, no.

192
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,394
Weddings are a great place
to meet chicks.

193
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,869
I have to be unfettered.

194
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,796
Do you see
what this is turning into?

195
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,758
Do I need this?
I have got to get out of this thing.

196
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,957
- Did you try the cigarettes?
- Yeah, they made me sick.

197
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,192
All right, all right.
Let's get down here.

198
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,558
You really wanna get out
of this thing?

199
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,552
- Yeah.
- All right. I got two words for you:

200
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,631
Prenup.

201
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,559
Prenup, what does that mean?

202
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,998
- Ask her to sign a prenup.
- What does that do?

203
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,276
Because most women,
when asked to sign a prenup...

204
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,954
...are so offended,
they back out of the marriage.

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,558
They are?

206
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,879
- Elaine?
- I wouldn't sign one.

207
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,351
Prenup, of course.

208
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,039
- Kramer.
- Get out of here.

209
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,799
Hey, I've been going over the list.
Wanna invite The Drake?

211
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,349
Oh, got to invite The Drake.

212
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,953
Listen.

213
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,191
There's something
that's been on my mind...

214
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,148
...and we haven't really talked about it
and it's kind of important to me.

215
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,834
What is it?

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,673
Well, I've put a lot of thought
into this...

217
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,515
...and I think that I would like you
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

218
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,835
- A prenup?
- Yeah.

219
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,917
What's so funny?

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,997
You don't have any money.
I make more money than you do.

221
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,918
Yeah, give me the papers,
I'll sign them.

222
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,273
A prenup.

223
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,957
Excuse me.

224
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,798
Jerry.

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,672
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hello.

226
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,796
- Remember I told you about the bank?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,032
Well, I went in there
and they said, "hey."

228
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,552
"Hey" is the same as "hello."
What do you think?

229
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,551
Yeah, I think it's the same thing.

230
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,680
Oh, big surprise.

231
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,152
- Delivery from Melody Stationers.
- Oh, those are the invitations.

232
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,197
- Just sign here.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,713
Thank you.

234
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,917
- See you later.
- Oh, these are so cheap.

235
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,196
Don't forget tomorrow.
We're shopping for rings...

236
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,069
...so don't make any plans.
And this time we're not skimping.

237
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,879
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,917
- Jeannie left?
- Yeah, she's coming to see...

239
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,594
...my act tonight.
- Oh, yeah? Well, that's nice.

240
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,354
I'm sure that's right up her alley.

241
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,919
- What's with you?
- Nothing.

242
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,229
- Something on your mind?
- No.

243
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,628
- Looks like there is.
- No.

244
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,314
Come on, something's
on your mind. Out with it.

245
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,590
I don't like her!

246
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,472
- You don't like her?
- That's right.

247
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,677
I don't like her.
I never liked her from the get-go.

248
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,628
- What's wrong with her?
- Everything she thinks, you think.

249
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,109
Everything you think, she thinks.
No, I can't take it.

250
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,511
I can't take it, Jerry.
It's too much. It's too much.

251
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,796
If you can't take her,
maybe you can't take me.

252
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,958
- So that's how it's gonna be?
- That's how it's gonna be.

253
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,998
Oh, God help us!

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,479
Awful.

255
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,755
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,753
I was in here the other day,
and I went up to that teller...

257
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,353
...and he didn't say "hello."

258
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,953
Well, then you are entitled to $100.
That's our policy.

259
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,111
Yeah, but he wouldn't
give me the money.

260
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,192
Jim, can I see you for a second?

261
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,673
- Yes, can you give me a minute?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,877
He'll be right over.

263
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,028
What is this, oak?

264
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,231
- I think it's pine.
- Pine is good.

265
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,551
Yeah, pine's okay.

266
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,674
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,673
Jim, the man here
says he came in the other day...

268
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,149
...you didn't say "hello."
- No, that's not true.

269
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,232
I said "hey." You know,
like a friendly greeting, "hey."

270
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,039
- Yeah, but that's not "hello."
- That's a tough one.

271
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,511
Let me bring
some other people in on this.

272
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,878
Barbara, Jane, Mike,
can I see you, please?

273
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,039
- How you doing?
- What's happening?

274
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,679
What's up?

275
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,150
Can you excuse us
for just one minute? Just one minute.

276
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,479
Thanks.

277
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,512
How's it going?

278
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,637
Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

279
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,313
Sir, have a seat.

280
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,308
Well, we've discussed this.
Here's the feeling.

281
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,199
You got a greeting. It starts with an H.
How's 20 bucks sound?

282
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,873
- I'll take it.
- All right, sir.

283
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,676
Will you marry me?

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,072
I would like to propose a toast...
Wait a second!

285
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,674
George! George Costanza,
come in here!

286
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,478
- Georgie boy.
- George, big news.

287
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,596
- I'm getting married.
- Married? What?

288
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,469
September 21 st, first day of autumn.
Leaves changing, beautiful colours.

289
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,868
- All that crap.
- You see?

290
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,349
- I kept up my end of the pact.
- Oh, good for you.

291
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,351
- And look, champagne.
- Hey.

292
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,988
- To our future wives.
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,718
Yeah.

294
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,879
This has been quite a night.
I could sure use a cup of coffee.

295
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,554
Hey, what's the deal with decaf?

296
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,472
How do they get the caffeine
out of there?

297
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,473
- And then where does it go?
- I don't know.

298
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,358
That's a shame.

299
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,109
- I'll just have a cup of coffee.
- Bowl of corn flakes.

300
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,397
More cereal?
That's your third bowl today.

301
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,030
- You had it for breakfast and lunch.
- Hey. So, what's the deal with brunch?

302
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,191
If it's a combination
of breakfast and lunch...

303
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,193
...how come there's no "lupper,"
or no "linner"?

304
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,639
Hey!

305
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,560
Frank just called me.
Congratulations.

306
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,917
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Look, I'm sorry about before.

307
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,197
- I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry.
- Yeah, yeah.

308
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,033
Come on, come on.
What's the matter?

309
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,350
I think I may have
made a big mistake.

310
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,268
- Oh, come on.
- No, all of a sudden it hit me.

311
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,919
I realized what the problem is.

312
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,036
I can't be with someone like me.

313
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,191
I hate myself!

314
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,869
I need to be with someone
the complete opposite of me.

315
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,952
It's too much, Kramer.
I can't take it! I can't take it!

316
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,153
It's too bad you got engaged.

317
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,597
Yeah, too bad.

318
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,957
Hello? Oh, hey, George.

319
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,032
What? Really?

320
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,395
I'll call Elaine.
We'll meet you down there.

321
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,790
- What happened?
- They took Susan to the hospital.

322
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,635
- So she was just lying there?
- Yeah.

323
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,552
- I wonder what happened.
- I don't know.

324
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,790
There's the doctor.

325
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,518
Excuse me, are you the husband?

326
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,355
- Well, not yet. Fiancé.
- Yes. Well, I'm sorry.

327
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,158
She's gone.

328
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,319
What's that?

329
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,354
She expired.

330
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,392
Are you sure?

331
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,359
Yes, of course.

332
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,115
So...

333
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,508
...she's dead?

334
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,194
Yes.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,319
Let me ask you...

336
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,918
...had she been exposed
to any kind of inexpensive glue?

337
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,516
- Why?
- We found traces...

338
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,319
...of a certain toxic adhesive...

339
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,314
...commonly found
in very low-priced envelopes.

340
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,034
Well, she was sending out
our wedding invitations.

341
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,394
That's probably what did it.

342
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,959
We were expecting
about 200 people.

343
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,592
Well, thank you, doctor.

344
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,117
She's...

345
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,473
...gone.

346
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,433
Dead?

347
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,475
I'm so sorry, George.

348
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,277
Yeah, me too.

349
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,189
Poor Lilly.

350
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,191
- Susan.
- Susan.

351
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,828
- How did it happen?
- Apparently the glue...

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,117
...in the wedding invitations was...

353
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,958
...toxic.

354
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,712
Well, that's weird.

355
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,197
So I guess...

356
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,912
...you're not getting married.
- Yeah.

357
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,153
But...

358
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,588
- Yeah?
- Well, now I'm engaged.

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,194
Yeah?

360
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,471
Well, I thought
we'd both be getting married.

361
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,988
Hey, what can I tell you?

362
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,429
All right.

363
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,951
Well, let's get some coffee.

364
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,469
We had a pact!

365
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,110
Yes, I'd like to speak
with Marisa Tomei, please.

366
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,753
Marisa, hi. It's George Costanza.

367
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,351
I'm the short, funny, quirky
bald man you met a little while ago.

368
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,875
Yeah, I was just calling
because I wanted you to know...

369
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,191
...that I'm not engaged anymore.

370
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,995
Well, she died.

371
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,877
Toxic glue
from the wedding invitations.

372
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,279
Well, we were expecting
about 200 people.

373
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,395
Yeah. Anyway,
I've got the funeral tomorrow...

374
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,388
...but my weekend
is pretty wide open...

375
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,397
...and, you know,
I was wondering... Hello?

376
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,152
Hello?
