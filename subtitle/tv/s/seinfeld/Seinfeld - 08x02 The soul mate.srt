1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,069
You know, I can now bite
my fingernails so evenly...

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,301
...I don't even need
to use a clipper anymore.

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,070
But it's a pleasure to use clippers.

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,511
Why gnaw away like a mental patient
when we have this elegant device?

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,518
What if you're in prison?

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,418
-You don't think they give clippers?
-No, it's like a weapon.

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,889
You know what's really a weapon,
that big toenail.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,723
You let that grow for a month,
take it in the shower, it's like a shiv.

9
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:33,830
I love prison.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,059
It is fascinating.

11
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,600
Yeah, maybe someday.

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,378
You want me to find
a poem about Susan?

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,573
May she rest in peace.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,212
Well, we think it would be a nice touch
for the foundation literature.

15
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,016
You have a favorite poet, George?

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,560
I like Flavman.

17
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,491
-Pardon?
-Flavman.

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,263
Well, you should choose the poem
since you knew Susan best...

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:14,271
...at the time
of her unfortunate...accident.

20
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,671
-He cleared his throat?
-Yes.

21
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,075
So?

22
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,684
He did it right as he said,
"Her unfortunate accident."

23
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,046
Not getting it.

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,984
Jerry, a throat clear is a non-verbal
implication of doubt.

25
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,589
He thinks I killed Susan.

26
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,488
Oh, help me, Rhonda.

27
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,255
-What time is it?
-One-fifteen.

28
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,921
Right now?

29
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,597
I gotta go meet Pam.

30
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,600
Oh, the bookstore girl.
How's that going?

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,433
Okay. I'm just not gaga over her.

32
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,097
For once, I'd like to be gaga.

33
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,503
Where's Elaine?

34
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,372
She's having Carol,
Gail and Lisa over.

35
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,012
You know, they all have kids now.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,045
What's with all these people
having babies?

37
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,616
-Perpetuation of the species.
-Yeah, right.

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,679
-By the way, just for the record--
-No, I did not.

39
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,379
All right.

40
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,450
But because it comes out
of your baby, it smells good.

41
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,463
Well, that's-- That's sweet.

42
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,795
Being a mother
has made me feel so beautiful.

43
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,505
Elaine, you gotta have a baby.

44
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,766
Oh, hey, you know...

45
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,375
...I had a piece of whitefish...

46
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,206
...over at Barney Greengrass
the other day and l--

47
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,072
Elaine, move to Long lsland
and have a baby already.

48
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,345
-I really like the city.
-The city's a toilet.

49
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,648
When's the last time
you saw my little Adam?

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,586
It was in the Hamptons.

51
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,249
-Oh, I have pictures.
-No, no, that's okay. It's--

52
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,022
Look at him, just look at him.

53
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,768
Elaine was telling me about
this whitefish she had the other day.

54
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,200
Do you really think I'm wrong
about this Wyck guy?

55
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,930
If you really wanna test him out...

56
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,007
...why don't you try
the Jerry Lewis trick?

57
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,610
-Jerry Lewis?
-I heard when Jerry left a meeting...

58
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,576
...he'd purposely leave a briefcase
with a tape recorder in it.

59
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,206
After five minutes, he'd come back,
listen to what everyone said.

60
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,977
-That's pretty paranoid.
-Yes, it is.

61
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,553
-I like it.
-I thought you might.

62
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,783
Hi, I'm Pam.

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,188
You must be Kramer.

64
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,026
Jerry has told me a lot about you.

65
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,859
Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry.
It's my day off.

66
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,704
I work in a bookstore.

67
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,038
Books.

68
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,270
Careful.

69
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,075
-Hi. Sorry I'm late.
-Hi.

70
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,682
That's okay. Kramer let me in.

71
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,715
If we rush,
we can still make the movie.

72
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,116
It was really nice meeting you.

73
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,890
I'm in trouble, buddy.

74
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,395
I just met a woman.

75
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,226
-Go on.
-Well...

76
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,130
...she's Jerry's girlfriend.

77
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,669
Yes, forbidden love.

78
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,636
She works in a bookshop.

79
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,402
-Her name is Pam.
-Pam.

80
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,910
I don't know the woman,
but she sounds quite fetching.

81
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,447
I can't even speak in front of her.

82
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,743
Jerry.

83
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,887
What could she possibly see
in Jerry?

84
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,585
She has delicate beauty.

85
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,659
Jerry wouldn't know delicate
if it bludgeoned him over the head.

86
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,661
And yet, he's my friend.

87
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,924
And therein lies the tragedy.

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,126
For I believe, sadly for you...

89
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,534
...that there is but one woman
meant for each of us.

90
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,107
One perfect angel
for whom we are put on this earth.

91
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,676
Oh, that's beautiful, Newman.

92
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,745
One winsome tulip...

93
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:45,873
...we ceaselessly yearn for throughout
our dreary workaday lives...

94
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:50,045
...and you, my friend,
have found your angel.

95
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,815
I can tell...

96
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,791
...for my heart has also been captured
by a breathless beauty...

97
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,487
...whom I fear I will never possess.

98
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,565
I thought we were talking about me.

99
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,633
Oh, right.

100
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,997
Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.

101
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,798
-Confront Jerry? I can't.
-You must.

102
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,168
-I won't.
-You will.

103
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,472
"Elaine, you gotta have a baby."

104
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,906
Where are the poetry magazines?

105
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,640
The New Yorker has poetry.

106
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,047
Yes, The New Yorker.

107
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,983
Why do you invite these women over
if they annoy you so much?

108
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,384
Well, they're my friends...

109
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,822
...but they act as if having a baby
takes some kind of talent.

110
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,689
Come on. You wanna have a baby.

111
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,195
-Why? Because I can?
-It's the life force.

112
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,163
I saw a show
on the mollusk last night.

113
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,826
Elaine, the mollusk travels
from Alaska to Chile...

114
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,767
...just for a shot at another mollusk.

115
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,167
You think you're any better?

116
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,572
Yes, I think I am better
than the mollusk.

117
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,406
Excuse me, I couldn't help
overhearing what you were saying.

118
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,071
-Oh, I'm sorry--
-No, no, I think I agree with you.

119
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,615
I mean, all this talk
about having babies.

120
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,412
Yeah, like you must procreate.

121
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,248
Besides, anyone can do it.

122
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,549
Oh, it's been done to death.

123
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,288
I should have a poem
very soon now.

124
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,658
Are you okay, George?

125
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,094
No, no.

126
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,663
Not really.

127
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:16,034
Ever since Susan passed on,
I have good days and bad.

128
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:21,004
Some days I'm haunted
by one word:

129
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,772
Why?

130
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,882
Why Susan?

131
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,348
Why wasn't it me
licking those invitations?

132
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,981
Why am I still here?

133
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,689
But I gotta run.

134
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,430
Now, the stock options
for this year look quite--

135
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,143
Briefcase.

136
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,149
So, Kevin, if I don't want children...

137
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,516
...does that make me
a bad humanitarian?

138
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,817
-Not at all.
-Because when you get to know me...

139
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,291
...you'll see that I'm
a pretty good humanitarian.

140
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,295
You are doing a wonderful job,
by the way.

141
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,434
-Thanks a lot.
-Right? Am I right?

142
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,762
Kramer, Kramer, come here,
look at my new friend Kevin.

143
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,768
Oh, you got a little--

144
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,642
-You got--
-Oh, yeah.

145
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,610
I just had two
double-fudge sundaes.

146
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,442
Oh, are you all right?

147
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,277
Yeah, I'll be okay.

148
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,853
You know, Jerry has one of those
every time he bombs on stage.

149
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,287
I'm sure he'll be sharing
his next one with Pam.

150
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,858
Oh, no, that won't last.

151
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,018
-What do you mean?
-He's not gaga.

152
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,562
Let me tell you. That Jerry Lewis...

153
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,467
...you wonder how people
get to the top?

154
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,972
It's ideas like this. Brilliant.

155
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,669
Look at this.
What the hell happened?

156
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:04,977
The whole side is damaged here,
and the lock is broken.

157
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,346
-How long did you leave it there?
-Five minutes.

158
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,881
What the hell happened here?

159
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,546
Play the tape.
Maybe we'll get a clue.

160
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,687
I have to rewind it first.

161
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,239
All right. All right.

162
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,904
Did anyone notice
George's fingernails?

163
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,577
Oh, my, yes, they look like
they were eaten away by weevils.

164
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,848
It's kind of hot in here.
Open the window.

165
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,252
Hey, what are you doing?

166
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,826
Dear God!

167
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,360
Is that it?

168
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,592
-lt stopped dead.
-What do you make of it?

169
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,032
I don't know.

170
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,370
Jerry, can we talk?

171
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,771
Kind of busy here.

172
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,141
-I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
-Why can't I stay?

173
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,941
Because it doesn't concern you.

174
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,051
Well, if it doesn't concern me,
then I can stay.

175
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,723
-So, what's on your mind?
-It's Pam.

176
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,127
-Pam? What about Pam?
-I love her, Jerry.

177
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,667
-You what?
-I love her.

178
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,134
-ls that right?
-Oh, she's-- She's real.

179
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,764
She can bring home the bacon
and fry it in the pan.

180
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,643
-What does that mean?
-Oh, and that voice.

181
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,305
-What about her name?
-Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name.

182
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,809
Pam.

183
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,083
Pam?

184
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,283
Pam!

185
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,390
-She's got really nice hair.
-Oh, it's incredible.

186
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,551
Although, I might replace
her tortoise clip...

187
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,425
...with one of those velvet scrunchies.
I love those.

188
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,290
You've got really specific tastes.

189
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,866
Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.

190
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,666
She got nice calves.

191
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,466
Oh, she's a dreamboat,
but you don't like her.

192
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,666
Maybe I could.
You're making some good points.

193
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,743
-No, you can't, Jerry.
-But I might.

194
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,402
-Oh, no, you don't.
-Why not?

195
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,411
-The voice, the calves, the bacon.
-What?

196
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,346
I think I can.
I even like the name Pam.

197
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,780
Pam. Pam.

198
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,693
So now he wants her
more than ever.

199
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,232
Blast.

200
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,701
What am I gonna do, huh?

201
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,271
Don't despair, my friend.

202
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,141
I won't allow your love
to go unrequited, not like mine.

203
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,713
What, again with you?

204
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,110
Sorry.

205
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,184
But love is a spice
with many tastes...

206
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:59,222
...a dizzying array of textures
and moments.

207
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,489
If only I could say things like that
around her.

208
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,823
Yes.

209
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,156
Well, I hear three distinct sounds:

210
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,165
A low rumple...

211
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,930
...followed by a metallic squink--

212
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,936
Yes, yes, I heard the squink.

213
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:19,009
--followed by a mysterious galonk.

214
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,842
It's a real baffler, isn't it?

215
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,539
Well, one question
does come to mind.

216
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:31,782
Have you considered just asking them
what happened to the briefcase?

217
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,920
They would never tell me.

218
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,326
First of all, they probably think
that I killed Susan.

219
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,964
Besides, I don't even think
they like me.

220
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,532
That Pam. I am gaga over her.

221
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,101
"Gaga"? When did that happen?

222
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,602
Yesterday, 6-ish.

223
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,137
Well, maybe we should double.
I'm pretty gaga myself.

224
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,937
You just met the guy yesterday.

225
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,704
Yeah, but we have a common goal.

226
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,111
A barren, sterile existence
that ends when you die?

227
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,147
Yeah.

228
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,946
You believe this guy
doesn't wanna have kids?

229
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,785
-Yeah, of course.
-A guy will say anything to a woman.

230
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,790
Oh, please, he wouldn't say that.

231
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,124
Elaine, I once told a woman
that I coined the phrase:

232
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,629
"Pardon my French."

233
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,004
I once told a woman I don't eat cake
because it goes right to my thighs.

234
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,132
Once told a woman
I enjoy spending time with my family.

235
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:32,213
Your looks and my words
will have built the perfect beast.

236
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,908
All right.

237
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,664
-Oh, hi, Kramer.
-Hi, how are you?

238
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,799
Hi, how are you?

239
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,695
-I'm great.
-I too am well.

240
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,599
I too am well.

241
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,669
-Do I smell Pantene?
-Do I smell--?

242
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,000
-Pantene!
-Pantene?

243
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,007
Oh, my shampoo.

244
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,773
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it is Pantene.

245
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,383
I got a free sample of it
in with my junk mail.

246
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,179
There really is no junk mail.

247
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,322
Everybody wants a check
or birthday card--

248
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,890
It requires just as much manpower
to deliver as their precious cards--

249
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,186
Newman.

250
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,989
What?

251
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,226
Human. Human.

252
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,802
It's human to be moved
by a fragrance.

253
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,232
That's so true.

254
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,670
Her bouquet cleaved his hardened--

255
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,969
-Shell.
-Shell

256
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,477
And fondled his muscled heart

257
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,248
He imbibed her glistening spell

258
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:43,411
Just before the other shoe fell

259
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,082
Kramer, that is so lovely.

260
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,393
It's by an unknown
20th century poet.

261
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,589
-Oh, what's him name?
-Newman.

262
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,200
Elaine, you changed my life.

263
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,933
Oh, Kevin, you can go on and on
about how you don't want kids...

264
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,475
...and it sounds--
It sounds really nice...

265
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:11,048
...but the truth is, I don't know
if you mean it or not.

266
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,242
I got a vasectomy this morning.

267
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,013
Although, I have a hunch
you mean it.

268
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,791
I just came by to tell you...

269
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:27,092
...I'm really, really happy
about this relationship. Really happy.

270
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,396
Oh, well, that's nice.

271
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,372
A velvet scrunchie.

272
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,302
Kramer.

273
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,886
Hello, Newman.

274
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,745
Hello, Jerry.

275
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,151
How's Pam?

276
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,554
Pam? What do you care?

277
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,889
Well, ta-ta.

278
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,092
Wait a minute.

279
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,823
All right, Newman, this is it.

280
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,192
Steady, Jerry.

281
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,960
Steady. Wouldn't wanna
lose your cool at a time like this.

282
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,434
-Why not?
-Because right now...

283
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,073
...I'm the only chance you've got.

284
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,034
Come on.

285
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,907
I can't believe I'm losing Pam.

286
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,608
I know how you feel...

287
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,050
...for I too have a woman
for whom I pine.

288
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,054
-I thought we were talking about me.
-Right.

289
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,192
Anyway, I don't need your help.

290
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,225
Oh, don't you, joke boy?

291
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,865
You really think you can manipulate
that beautiful young woman...

292
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,524
...Iike the half-soused,
nightclub rabble...

293
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,139
...that lap up your inane
"observations"?

294
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,604
All right, Newman.

295
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,369
What do I to get you to stop
pulling strings for Kramer?

296
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,480
Well, there is a little something
you can do for me.

297
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,910
Come on, out with it.

298
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,517
It's about Elaine.

299
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,209
Elaine? What does she have to--?

300
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,549
Oh, no.

301
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,957
You dated her.
Give me some inside information.

302
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,686
Anything I can use.

303
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,894
Well, I know she doesn't
wanna have kids.

304
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,228
I thought you'd be
a little more enthusiastic about it.

305
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:51,038
I know. I don't want...kids.

306
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,405
-What was that?
-Well...

307
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,274
...Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt.

308
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,415
I mean, nothing is 1 00 percent.

309
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,448
This is.

310
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,282
-Oh, boy, I always do this.
-What?

311
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,822
I get all jazzed up about something,
and I go way too far with it.

312
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,289
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

313
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,896
Like last summer, I'm watching TV
and I saw one of those jet skis.

314
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,694
Four thousand dollars later,
and it's sitting in my garage.

315
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,099
You know, that's weird actually,
because I'm sort of the same way.

316
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,866
I mean, once for, like, no reason,
I flattened my hair...

317
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,773
...and I had all these strands
hanging in my face all the time.

318
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,041
Sometimes I think I do want kids,
maybe a lot of kids.

319
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,117
Sometimes I think about
wearing my hair real short.

320
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:38,484
Yeah, I think I like short hair,
really short.

321
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,284
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

322
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,627
This is a crude mock-up
of the conference room.

323
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,268
One-fourteenth scale.

324
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,967
When did you build this thing?

325
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,367
Yesterday. Took the day off.

326
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:59,501
Now, from the time
that I left the room--

327
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,805
-Wait. That's you?
-Yeah.

328
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,943
I think the M&M should be you.

329
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,153
All right, whatever.

330
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,726
Now, whatever caused
the damage...

331
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:21,161
...it was jarring enough
to completely stop the tape.

332
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,097
-And?
-Okay.

333
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,464
That's what we know.

334
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,835
-But we already knew that.
-Well, yeah.

335
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,000
Just give me some idea
what you think it could be.

336
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,880
-I don't know if you're ready for it.
-Please.

337
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,646
I believe that I'm about
to become the target...

338
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,084
...of a systematic process
of intimidation and manipulation...

339
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,453
-...the likes of which--
-Hold it. You're right. I'm not ready.

340
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,757
-Yeah?
-It's Pam.

341
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,660
Come on up. All right, it's Pam.
You gotta get going.

342
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,300
I'm not through here, Jerry.

343
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,493
I'm gonna keep on investigating.

344
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,302
This thing is like an onion.

345
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,875
The more layers you peel,
the more it stinks.

346
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,912
What was that?

347
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,051
We were just playing.

348
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,188
Listen, I had a long talk
with Kramer today.

349
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:22,318
Well, the thing is l--
I think I have a little crush on him.

350
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,190
I'm so happy.

351
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,229
My world suddenly has meaning.

352
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,424
This is the man
you have a crush on?

353
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,569
Well, I have feelings for both of you.

354
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,671
You have feelings for him?
We're soul mates.

355
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,500
Why can't I be a soul mate?

356
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,405
Jerry, you really think Pam would want
you to be the father of her children?

357
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,909
Children?

358
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,912
Who said anything about children?
I don't wanna have children.

359
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,086
There are people in this room...

360
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:54,214
...who would've been very happy
to never see this briefcase again.

361
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,460
There are people in this room...

362
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,188
...who think they can destroy
other people's property...

363
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,093
...and get away with it.

364
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,897
Well, let me tell you something
about those people.

365
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,594
They weren't
counting on this brain...

366
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,440
...and this tape recorder.

367
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,132
-George--
-You'll have your turn.

368
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,073
The truth must be heard.

369
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,648
Hey, what are you doing?

370
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,609
Dear God!

371
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,880
That's all there was...

372
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,789
...and yet it speaks volumes.

373
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,296
A low rumple...

374
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,295
...a metallic squink...

375
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,835
...a galonk...

376
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,495
...and someone crying out,
"Dear God!"

377
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:48,005
Let's start with-- With you, Wyck.

378
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,648
George, Quinn here
was moving a chair.

379
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,684
He lost his balance and dropped it.

380
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,583
It must have fallen
on your briefcase...

381
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,283
...which, for some reason,
contained a running tape recorder.

382
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,529
All right then.

383
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,734
We've gotten to the bottom of that.

384
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,009
What are you guys doing here?

385
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,841
We're getting vasectomies.

386
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,975
-Why?
-I'm doing it for you.

387
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,979
-What?
-What did you do to your hair?

388
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,023
I cut it.

389
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,453
It's a little short.

390
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,116
You think?

391
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,289
What are you doing here?

392
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,523
Kevin's having
his vasectomy reversed.

393
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,997
-Reversed?
-Reversed?

394
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,951
He imbibed her glistening spell

395
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,559
Just before the other shoe fell

396
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,764
Is that a Keats poem?

397
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,424
No, it's a Newman.

398
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,696
Well, I gotta run.

399
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,241
Does anyone think George
might have murdered Susan?

400
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,710
Oh, yeah, I just assumed
he murdered her.

401
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,720
-Of course he killed her.
-So it's not just me then.

402
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,025
All right. Back to business.
