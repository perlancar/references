1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,589
When did tick-tack-toe
become the pound sign?

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,954
Why not call it what it is?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,635
"Leave your numeric message now,
and then press Archie's head."

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,515
And what is that redial button?
Let's face it.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,638
You'll either get the person, the
machine or they have call waiting.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,677
Who is redialling and redialling?

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,912
This is like the harassment key
for people in a fight, you know.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,310
Hey, I'm not through.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,235
You can't do that to me.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,391
And another thing.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,471
Who would win a fight
between you and me?

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,834
What do you mean?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,639
If you and I ever got into
a really serious fight, you know...

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,950
...and the punches started flying,
who would win?

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,949
Well, I think that's pretty obvious.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,032
Yeah, me too.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,914
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hey.

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,150
Who do you think would win
a fight between me...

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,390
...and gorgeous George here?

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,075
- You mean a real "fight" fight?
- Mano a baldo.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,473
George.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,840
- Why?
- George fights dirty.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,228
Really? What would you do?

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,598
Pull hair, poke eyes, groin stuff.
Whatever I gotta do.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,996
So listen, you're not doing
anything tomorrow, are you?

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,029
Because I have an extra ticket to the
historical clothing exhibit at the Met.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,952
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,509
George?

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,877
Would I want to see what
Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,792
There's nobody I can go with.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,959
You know what?
I don't have one female friend left.

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,317
Well, no, of course, you don't.
You're a man's woman.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,516
You hate other women
and they hate you.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,874
Thank you.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,429
So, Jerry, what time
are we going to the movies?

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,398
- How about the 8:30?
- Saddle up and ride.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,677
- You wanna get something to eat first?
- No, I'm good.

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,154
I wonder if Susan...?

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,472
No, I better just go.

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,074
All right. See you.

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,233
There's nothing more pathetic than
a grown man who's afraid of a woman.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,748
Hey, why don't you ask Susan?

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,433
- George's Susan?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,990
Yeah, why not Susan?

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,593
I should be friends with Susan.

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,194
Of course, Susan.

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,509
Okay. I'll see you guys. Bye.

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,954
That's gonna be trouble.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,871
- Why?
- Jerry, don't you see?

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,918
This world here,
this is George's sanctuary.

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,232
If Susan comes into contact
with this world, his worlds collide.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,434
You know what happens then?

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,752
Did I tell you I'm getting
a new number?

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,036
- How come?
- Chicks, man.

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,111
Too many chicks know my number.

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,236
Hey, Jerry, how are you,
Mr. Backstroke?

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,755
Kramer, this is Ramon
from the new health club I joined.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,239
- You know what happened?
- What?

59
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,754
They fired me.

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,239
- Really?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,311
Said I put too much chlorine
in the pool.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,030
- Hey, well, stay out of the deep end.
- Okay. See you later.

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,916
What's in the deep end?

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,479
- Hello.
- Hey, George.

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,551
- Hey, Laney, what's going on?
- Nothing much.

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,948
Can I talk to Susan?

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,231
Yeah, right. Hang on.
I'll get her for you.

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,277
Seriously, what's up?

69
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,708
No, George, really,
can I talk to Susan?

70
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,229
Susan, why?

71
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,278
Because I wanna ask her to lunch
and to the Met tomorrow.

72
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,908
Oh, I don't think you wanna do that.

73
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,879
- Why not?
- Well, what would be the point of that?

74
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,394
Will you put her on the phone?

75
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,630
Where did this come from
all of a sudden?

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,870
Are you gonna let me
talk to Susan or not?

77
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,271
I really think I should have
been consulted about this.

78
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,594
Here. Something.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,110
Hello?

80
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,875
Oh, that sounds great.
Oh, I love that sort of stuff.

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,028
- You wanna sit here?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,434
Over there.

83
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,439
- Why?
- A little buffer zone.

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,269
If we were at my place on the couch,
would we sit right next to each other?

85
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,317
- No, you got a point.
- All right.

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,952
I can't.

87
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,512
- What are you doing?
- Well, these seats have no lumbar.

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,073
Oh, hey, there's Ramon.
Pretend we're talking.

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,477
- We are talking.
- Pretend it's interesting.

90
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,311
So, well, then I had to kill him
and the police are still looking for me.

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,516
- Yeah, that's...
- Hey, hi, Jerry.

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,398
- Hey, Ramon.
- I took a lot of napkins.

93
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,879
- You want some?
- Oh, no, thanks.

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,359
Hey, is this seat taken?

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,999
No.

96
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,840
And the worst part is, after the movie
he leeched onto us...

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,230
...we wound up having
coffee with him for two hours.

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,960
Then he walks us home, all the way
back to the building.

99
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,271
Finally, I said, " Look, Ramon,
I gotta go to bed now."

100
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,832
- Have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
- No, why?

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,479
She called Susan last night.

102
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,312
Oh, yeah, I know.

103
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,153
- How do you know?
- It was my idea.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,718
- Your idea?
- Yeah?

105
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,029
What'd you do that for?

106
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,075
She was looking for someone
to go to the show with.

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,914
Well, that was really a stupid thing.

108
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,594
- You know what's gonna happen now?
- Worlds collide.

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,518
Yeah.

110
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,272
Because this world is
your sanctuary...

111
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,750
...and if it comes in contact with this...
- Yes, it blows up.

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,717
If you know,
what did you tell Elaine for?

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,871
I didn't know. Kramer told me
about the worlds.

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,634
You couldn't figure out
the worlds theory for yourself?

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,279
It's just common sense.

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,194
Anybody knows
you gotta keep your worlds apart.

117
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,998
Yeah, I guess I slipped up.

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,428
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,158
He knows the worlds theory.

120
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,117
What? Is it blowing up?

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,678
Cosmo, go.

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,513
No, no, no, no.

123
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,236
This new telephone number
is driving me crazy.

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,118
Wrong numbers every five minutes.

125
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,397
- What is it?
- Well, it's 555-3455.

126
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,872
- 555-3455.
- Yeah.

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,799
555-3455.

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,396
Well, wait a second.
Don't you see? That's 555-FILK.

129
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,152
- What's "filk"?
- Filk's nothing.

130
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,118
But 555-FILM is Moviefone.

131
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,633
Oh, Moviefone.

132
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,792
Yeah, so people are just dialling it
by mistake and getting you.

133
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,636
- So I'm filk.
- You're filk.

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,631
Oh, Mama.

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,834
Well, but what about that number
Susan B. Anthony wore...

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,956
...to the 19th Amendment party, huh?

137
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,829
Quite the décolletage
for a suffragette.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,037
Well, it must have been
one hell of a party.

139
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,952
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,519
What?

141
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,754
Forget it.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,832
What? You can tell me.
I'll put it in the vault.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,592
The vault?

144
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,957
Mr. Seinfeld, we heard
you went to the movies with Ramon.

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,270
I didn't actually go with Ramon.
I bumped into him.

146
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,556
It's good he has friends
like you to cheer him up.

147
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,234
- Tell him to call us.
- Tell him Dustin says hello.

148
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,231
- All right. I gotta go.
- To see Ramon?

149
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,308
What else did you two do?

150
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,914
Oh, I don't know.
You know, girlie stuff.

151
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,513
So flower shows and shopping
for pretty bows...

152
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,070
And then back to her place, strip down
to bra and panties for a tickle fight?

153
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,997
That's what you think girls do,
isn't it?

154
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,789
Yes, I do.

155
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,798
Alrighty.

156
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,158
Hey, you know, George isn't too happy
about your new friendship.

157
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,595
Yeah, well, I don't really give a sh...

158
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,270
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,232
Yeah, hello.

160
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,119
Yeah, no, no, no. Hold on.

161
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,191
Yeah, Cupid's Rifle.
Eight-thirty, Sony Lincoln Square.

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,113
Yeah, no, no, no.
No problem. Yeah.

163
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,748
You're looking up movies
for people now?

164
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,638
I got time.

165
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,439
And this.

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,238
Cosmo here.

167
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,437
Yeah. No, no, no. I'll help.

168
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,716
Yeah, Firestorm's good.
I saw it yesterday.

169
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,598
My buddy Jerry,
he's seen it twice.

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,193
You wanna talk to him?

171
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,316
- Here.
- No, Kramer. I don't wanna talk to...

172
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,916
Just tell him about the picture.
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

173
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,310
Yes, are you still there?
Look, I'm sorry about that.

174
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,631
All right, there's an 8:30
and a 10: 15 showing.

175
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,713
Oh, that's George. Yeah?

176
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,233
Hey, it's Ramon.

177
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,755
- What?
- It's Ramon, Jerry. I'm coming up.

178
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,674
Oh, okay.

179
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,239
What is he doing here?

180
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,834
- Who? Who is Ramon?
- He's the pool guy.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,479
- What pool guy?
- Do me a favour.

182
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,710
- Stick around while he's here.
- Yeah, no problem.

183
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,269
Hey, Jerry, how are you, crazy guy?

184
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,597
- So, Ramon, this is my friend Elaine.
- Yeah, and I was just leaving.

185
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,552
Bye-bye, Jerry.

186
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,640
- What are you doing around here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

187
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
- I figured I'd check you out.
- I kind of had some things to do.

188
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,398
Oh, yeah?
Where are you going?

189
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,393
Just, you know, I don't know.
Stuff I gotta do.

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,393
Hey, that's cool.
I'm up for some stuff.

191
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,598
All right.

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,076
So get this. I get down there...

193
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,152
...and right away
I see the drain is clogged.

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,108
- It's obvious. Can you believe that?
- All right, Ramon. I'm gonna get going.

195
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,677
- I think we should separate here.
- What are you trying to say, Jerry?

196
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,798
Look. You're a nice guy,
but I actually only have three friends.

197
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,234
I really can't handle any more.

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,277
I see. It's because I clean pools,
right?

199
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,670
That has nothing to do with it.

200
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,757
Yeah, we got along real well.

201
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,196
Because, you know,
she has no female friends.

202
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,430
You know that, don't you?

203
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,637
Something strange about a woman
whose friends are all men.

204
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,236
Yeah, I know.
We talked all about that.

205
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,356
- You talked all about that?
- Oh, yeah.

206
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,398
Elaine opened up her vault.

207
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,634
Did you just say "vault"?

208
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,552
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?

209
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,074
You got that from Elaine?

210
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,629
Yeah. So what?

211
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,711
Well, it's a little strange.

212
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,713
Are you gonna start
to talk like Elaine from now on?

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,074
I don't know.

214
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,595
Anyway, I thought
we'd all go to a movie on Friday.

215
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,751
We'd all go to a movie on Friday?

216
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,239
Yeah.

217
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,590
This is not good.

218
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,228
Worlds are colliding.

219
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,868
George is getting upset!

220
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,357
You have no idea
of the magnitude of this thing.

221
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,273
If she is allowed
to infiltrate this world...

222
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,035
...then George Costanza,
as you know him, ceases to exist.

223
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,110
You see, right now,
I have relationship George...

224
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,875
...but there is also
independent George.

225
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,793
That's the George you know,
the George you grew up with.

226
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,431
Movie George, coffee-shop George,
liar George, bawdy George.

227
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,435
- I love that George.
- Me too. And he's dying, Jerry.

228
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,433
If relationship George
walks through this door...

229
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,989
...he will kill independent George.

230
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,113
A George divided against itself
cannot stand.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,198
You're killing independent George.
You know that, don't you?

232
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,839
George, I don't even wanna get...

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,436
You know what word Susan
used last night? "Vault."

234
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,989
- So?
- She got that from you.

235
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,752
Well, I didn't tell her to say it.

236
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,798
Is she the only girl in the whole world?
Can't you find your own?

237
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,518
I like her.

238
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,478
You see? You see?

239
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,756
You see what I'm talking about?

240
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,390
It's all just slipping away.

241
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,357
And you're all letting it happen.

242
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,238
- So you wanna catch a movie later?
- Yeah, sure.

243
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,314
I don't have a paper, though.

244
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,434
Hello, and welcome to Moviefone.

245
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,639
Brought to you by
The New York Times and Hot 97.

246
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,030
Coming to theatres this Friday:

247
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,475
Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon.

248
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,676
You've got to get me
over that mountain!

249
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,990
No!

250
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,668
There's no higher place
than Mountain High. Rated R.

251
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,196
If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one.

252
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,318
Kramer, is that you?

253
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,871
Elaine?

254
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,190
What time does Chow Fun start?

255
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,438
I don't know.

256
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,471
Well, well, look who's here.

257
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,995
What are you doing here?
You could get in trouble.

258
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,673
No, I don't think so, Jerry.

259
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,512
You see, they gave me my job back.

260
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,195
- What?
- I'm a pool boy again.

261
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,716
Look, Ramon, about the other day,
I'm sorry if I offended you.

262
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,472
I get a little crabby on the subway.

263
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,914
Oh, do you?

264
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,159
What happened to all the towels?

265
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,838
I guess they must have
disappeared.

266
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,390
Hey, Jerry, look at all the towels they
gave me. I really hit the jackpot.

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,233
It's been a terrible situation down there
the past couple of days.

268
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,516
He's really making things
uncomfortable for me.

269
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,399
There's always a big pile
of dirty towels in front of my locker.

270
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,869
Then when I come out of pool,
my towel is always gone.

271
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,952
- So frustrating.
- Tell me about it.

272
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,430
So you wanna join me and Susan
for lunch at the coffee shop?

273
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,319
- You're meeting at the coffee shop?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,550
I'm meeting George
for lunch at the coffee shop.

275
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,758
Well, this should be very interesting.

276
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,196
- Hey, Elaine, Jerry. Over here.
- Oh, there they are.

277
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,554
- Look who I ran into.
- Great.

278
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,314
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

279
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,952
Come on. Aren't you gonna
join us?

280
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,759
You know, I'm supposed to meet...

281
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,069
...someone.

282
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,959
- I'll wait for him outside.
- Wait here. Come on, sit down.

283
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,111
What's the matter with you?

284
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,915
This is gonna be ugly.

285
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,070
- What's that, Jerry?
- I said, boy, am I ugly.

286
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,716
Hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,752
One, two...

288
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,393
...three...

289
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,194
...four.

290
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,155
- Hey, George!
- No, we'll pull up another chair.

291
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,311
I see you there, Ramon.

292
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,153
Hey, I'm not done.

293
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,709
I know what you're up to, Ramon.

294
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,711
Because I'm a member here,
this is my place to swim.

295
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,553
Now, you better cut it out, Ramon.
Just stop it.

296
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,153
Ollie, ollie, oxen free!

297
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,631
No!

298
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,590
I think he's gonna need
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

299
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,828
Mouth-to-mouth?

300
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,474
Yeah.

301
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,988
Well...

302
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,155
...go ahead.

303
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,038
You go.

304
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,197
You knocked him out.

305
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,713
Yeah, but you pulled him in.

306
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,713
Come on, Newman. Do it.

307
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,119
No.

308
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,357
He might die.

309
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,272
Yeah. Maybe.

310
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,671
Jerry, we'll meet you
at the theatre. Okay.

311
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,910
Next showing's at 9:00.
We can't wait any longer.

312
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,548
Where could he be?
It's not like George to just disappear.

313
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,631
Look, let's just leave him
a note, okay?

314
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,358
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

315
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,919
"George.

316
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,632
Elaine and I went
to see Chunnel...

317
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,199
...with Jerry."

318
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,279
- "Love"?
- Yeah.

319
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,908
"Love, Susan."

320
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,351
So eventually these people came...

321
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,556
...and somebody gave him
mouth-to-mouth.

322
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,073
He could have died.

323
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,919
Yeah, it was a gamble.

324
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,718
Why didn't you give him
mouth-to-mouth?

325
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,279
How can you possibly
show your face there again?

326
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,112
Oh, I can't.
They revoked my membership.

327
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,238
Newman too. No, we can't go
anywhere near there.

328
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,236
Hi. Three for Chunnel.
Two adults, one child.

329
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,392
What the hell is this?

330
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,394
"George. Elaine and I went
to see Chunnel with Jerry."

331
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,910
With Jerry, huh? With Jerry.
Great. Great.

332
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,430
Probably went to the 84th Street.
That's where I always go with Jerry.

333
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,238
Hello, and welcome to Moviefone.

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,999
What?

341

You've selected Brown-Eyed Girl.

342
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,350
If this is correct, press one.

343
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,789
Why don't you just tell me the name
of the movie you selected.

344
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,714
Chunnel.

345
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,950
To find the theatre nearest you...

346
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,237
...please enter your
five-digit ZIP code now.

347
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,797
Why don't you just tell me
where you wanna see the movie.

348
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,750
Loews Paragon,
84th and Broadway.

349
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,072
Chunnel is playing at the Paragon
84th Street cinema...

350
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,073
...in the main theatre at 9:30 p.m.

351
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,959
Yeah, now I got you.

352
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,398
It's also playing
in theatre number two at 9:00.

353
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,952
- The English Channel Tunnel...
- Jerry.

354
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,190
...or Chunnel runs 32...
- Where are you?

355
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,395
With two openings.

356
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,358
- One here. And another here.
- I know you like to sit back here.

357
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,912
- That's all we've got. Thank you...
- Elaine?

358
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,071
- Can I ask you something?
- Susan?

359
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,796
I can't figure out
what's going on here.

360
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,712
I can't follow the plot.

361
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,154
Why did they kill that guy?

362
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,390
- I thought he was with them.
- That's not the guy.

363
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,278
That's a different guy.

364
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,873
What is he doing in the Chunnel?

365
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,235
Would you two please...?

366
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,313
Everybody out of the Chunnel!
Everybody out of the Chunnel!

367
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,318
Susan, Jerry.

368
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,789
Where are you?
I know you're there.

369
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,393
- Answer me.
- Hey, sit down.

370
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,030
Hey, hey, answer me!
Come on, show yourselves.

371
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,988
- We're trying to watch a movie here.
- Drink your soda.

372
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,799
Come on. I know you're there,
laughing at me.

373
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,394
Laughing and lying and laughing.

374
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,120
I had to go to Reggie's, Jerry.
Reggie's.

375
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,392
- You better stay off of there.
- Where are you?

376
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,391
Hey, are you sure you got
the right theatre?

377
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,348
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Chunnel. Susan!
- It's playing in two theatres.

378
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,709
- Two theatres?
- Yeah, there's a 9 too.

379
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,431
Your car is in the Chunnel,
somewhere between France...

380
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,079
Sorry.

381
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,636
- Good, huh?
- What'd you think, Susan?

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,438
I don't know.
I couldn't hear anything.

383
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,989
- You two talked the whole movie.
- Oh, well, come on.

384
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,038
- You wanna go grab a bite to eat?
- No, I don't think so.

385
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,713
- Why not?
- Well, you know...

386
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,678
...all you guys ever do is sit around
the coffee shop talking...

387
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,558
...sit around Jerry's apartment
talking.

388
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,750
Frankly, I don't know
how you can stand it.

389
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,429
See you.

390
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,397
I know they're in there.
The three of them.

391
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,030
Laughing at me, together.
Laughing and lying.

392
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,315
They're killing independent George!
They're all in on it!

393
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,993
Worlds are colliding!

394
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,753
Hello, and welcome
to your worst nightmare.

395
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,833
I know you're in there.
Cosmo Kramer, apartment 5B.

396
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,036
You're in big trouble now.

397
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,952
You've been stealing my business.

398
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,317
If you'd like to do this the easy way,
open the door now.

399
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,278
Or please select the number of
seconds you'd like to wait...

400
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,672
...before I break this door down.
Please select now.
