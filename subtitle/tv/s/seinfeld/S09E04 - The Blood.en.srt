1
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:04,364
Are you sure you can't stay longer?

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:05,904
No, we just came for the funeral. `

3
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:10,727
Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.
He was 96 years old.

4
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:13,599
That had nothing to do with it,
the man was out of shape.

5
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:17,623
That's why we joined a program.

6
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:20,007
We walk once around the
block three times a week.

7
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,176
And every morning I eat a plum.

8
00:00:22,294 --> 00:00:24,534
Well, what ever you do,
you're wearing me out.

9
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:25,918
What about you?

10
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:28,666
Yeah, looks like you're getting
a little spare tire there, tiger.

11
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:29,891
Really?

12
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,825
Hey, Seinfelds!
Hey, Mr. Kramer!

13
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,417
How long are you staying?
We just came down for a funeral.

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,372
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler.

15
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:41,705
Boy, that makes you
think. If he could go...

16
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:45,186
See you downstairs with the car.

17
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,234
Are you sure you don't need
a hand with that?

18
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:51,978
No no, the luggage is on the program.
I got a brick in here.

19
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:58,556
Did you give blood?
No, not giving. hoarding.

20
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:01,588
I'm storing it in to a blood bank.
Just in case.

21
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:04,939
In case of what?
Jerry, I know myself.

22
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,840
If I'm out on the street
and it's starts to go

23
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,277
down, I don't back off
until it's finished.

24
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,427
Are we finished?
Done.

25
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,779
Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.
Yeah...

26
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,550
You haven't seen Jimmy for years.

27
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,867
I know, I'm glad I got to see him
before he hit puberty and got,

28
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:27,800
you know all lurchy and awkward.

29
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,287
Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look
after him tomorrow evening.

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,750
Tomorrow evening, sure.

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,519
Do you know anyone responsible?
Do I know anyone??

32
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,728
Well, if you think of anybody,
give me a call.

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,394
What are you doing?
Incense, for the mood.

34
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,616
Oh yes, by no means, the mood.

35
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:55,339
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to lend support to the mood.

36
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:00,502
Um, cream soda?
Vanilla.

37
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:12,898
Can you believe that, Vivian
doesn't think I'm responsible?

38
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:15,643
Who wants to responsible?
When ever anything goes wrong,

39
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,234
he first thing they ask is:
who's responsible for this?

40
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:22,826
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on,
I love bossing people around.

41
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:28,345
What happened, I thought you were
with Tara tonight?

42
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:31,274
I was, I had to leave.
She lit some vanilla incenses.

43
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:32,939
The smell drove me
nuts, all I could think

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,634
about was food, I  had
to get out of there.

45
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,306
We need some pudding here! Pudding!

46
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,353
You just left? What did you tell her?

47
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:43,419
I told I had a bus transfer that was
only good just for another hour.

48
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,930
What?
I don't know, I was starving Jerry!

49
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:50,298
Oh, pudding! You want some?

50
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,676
Hey,you guys think I'm
getting a little chunky?

51
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,408
What are you kidding? We look great!

52
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:00,154
You know what this pudding needs?

53
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:03,459
The skin on the top, you know like
your mother used to make it on the stove.

54
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:04,890
Elaine, what do you think?

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,834
I think you're getting a little pudding
under the skin yourself.

56
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,649
My service rates went up?

57
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:17,465
You banks are all the same with your
hidden fees and your service charges.

58
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:20,497
Well, maybe I'll just take
my blood elsewhere, yeah.

59
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,485
Well, we can transfer to another
bank for you.

60
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:22,979
Oh, no no no...no more banks.

61
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,977
I'm keeping my blood in my
freezer with...my money!

62
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:32,457
So eh, what do you say?

63
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,984
I guess we could use some
food in our lovemaking.

64
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:42,522
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries,
your chocolate sauce,

65
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:47,955
your pastrami on rye with mustard,
your honey...

66
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,884
Wait wait wait, pastrami
on rye with mustard?

67
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:55,137
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know  they used
pastrami in that movie 9½ weeks?

68
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:57,464
Remember the pastrami scene?
No.

69
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:02,343
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters?
Where ever it was, it worked!

70
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,891
Didn't go for it, huh?
No.

71
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,777
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic
qualities  of the salted cured meats?

72
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:16,714
She tolerated the strawberries
and the chocolate sauce,

73
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,484
but eh, it's not a meal, you know?
Food and sex, those are my two passions.

74
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:27,216
It's only natural to combine them.
Natural?

75
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:30,768
Sex is about love between a man and
a woman, not a man and a sandwich.

76
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:35,753
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid
of the girl. She's integral.

77
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:38,863
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy
two of your needs,

78
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:41,546
how about satisfying one
of somebody else's.

79
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,793
Hey, speaking of which,

80
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:46,216
I found a great way to separate the skin
from  the top of the pudding

81
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:49,857
without leaving any around the edges:
Exacto knife.

82
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,168
I told you George, no more pudding.
I'm starting a purification program.

83
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,680
Keep all that kind of food
away from me.

84
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,584
Well, I guess these would be out
of the question.

85
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,605
What the hell is that?
Pudding skin singles.

86
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:11,790
Hey buddy, I'm borrowing
all your Tupperware.

87
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:16,782
Oh, why?
I closed down my account at the blood bank.

88
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,248
What, it...it's here in the building?
Right across the hall.

89
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:24,479
What, you wanna go see?
No I don't!

90
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:27,252
In fact, if even one
corpuscles of that blood

91
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:29,391
should find it's way across that hall

92
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,725
I will freak out on
you Kramer! Freak out.

93
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:36,470
You know, for a fat guy
you're not very jolly.

94
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:44,783
Hey, working out?
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.

95
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,510
What the heck is going on here?
Sorry buddy, clean house.

96
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:49,119
It's all health food.

97
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:52,314
Well, I may have to take it,
but I don't have to like it.

98
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:54,532
Vivian left me a message.

99
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,926
I guess a certain someone changed
her mind

100
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,849
about whether someone was responsible

101
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,790
enough to watch certain other someone.

102
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,751
Is this about me?
No.

103
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:07,326
Oh, then I lost interest.
Vivian, hi it's Elaine.

104
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:10,685
Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's,
I got your message...What?

105
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:20,605
Yeah, he's right here, hold on...
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight?

106
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:25,702
Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later.
Well, somebody's baby-sitting.

107
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:29,989
You? I'm more responsible than you are!
Don't be ridiculous.

108
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:31,888
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go

109
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,647
to fill my freezer with my own blood.

110
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:01,872
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
Kramer.

111
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:05,505
Don't take my money!
It is me, you idiot.

112
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,013
Hi, all right you've
got to get out of here,

113
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:09,808
I'm gonna baby-sit the
hell out of that kid.

114
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:12,074
No, I'm the baby-sitter.
No no no, you're out,

115
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:16,457
I'm in. Now, hit the road.

116
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:21,185
Elaine? What are you doing here?

117
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,225
Kramer is actually sleeping one off,
so I thought that I'd help out...

118
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,807
what's that, some raccoon or something...

119
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:33,576
Well, I guess this would be all right.

120
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,029
Jimmy, you remember Elaine?
She's gonna watch you tonight.

121
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:41,314
Hi Jimmy.Ouch!

122
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,613
Hey, what are you doing here?

123
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,663
I thought you were
baby-sitting at Vivian's.

124
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,607
here was an incident.
Oh no, where's the blood?

125
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,566
It's in here isn't it?
Would you stop it.

126
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,274
What is this?
It's Jell-O.

127
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:03,887
What about this?
This is blood isn't it?!

128
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:07,751
This is tomato juice, look...
Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!

129
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,559
Will you calm down. I took all
my blood down to Newman's.

130
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:13,020
He let me put it in his meat freezer.
Hey, what's going on?

131
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,230
Who made pudding?

132
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:16,820
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and

133
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,133
made more of those pudding skin singles.

134
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,742
They're delicious.
Damn that George,

135
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:24,006
I told him I don't want this
stuff around here anymore...

136
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,656
Heads up!
Aaah...

137
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,576
You're dead, president Lincoln!
You're dead!

138
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,335
I wish I was dead.
Can I have your juice?

139
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,511
As long as you don't put...

140
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,096
Thanks for the re-fill.

141
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:48,031
Hey, Elaine! How did it go?
Oh, he's...he's a joy...

142
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:51,471
Really? Some sitter have told me
he's bit of a handful.

143
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:53,583
Oh, handful of sunshine.

144
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,808
I wish I could do this
every day.

145
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,987
Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear.

146
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,783
I've been having a few
health problems lately.

147
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:04,617
It's not serious, is it?
Well, it might be.

148
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:07,437
Just in case anything
does happen,it's nice

149
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:09,832
to know there's
somebody like you around.

150
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:14,918
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know

151
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,799
Aah!
It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.

152
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,288
I can see that! What happened?
That knife, it nicked your jugular.

153
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:33,119
You know Jerry, when somebody yells
'heads up',

154
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:37,574
you're not supposed to actually look up.
I'll remember that.

155
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,358
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there.
You lost a lot of blood.

156
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,086
What?

157
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,807
Oh yeah, you've got three pints
of Kramer in you, buddy.

158
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:59,742
Three pints of Kramer's blood?
I can feel his blood inside of me.

159
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:08,245
Borrowing things from my blood.
Well, so much for purification week.

160
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:11,567
So, how's the fornicating gourmet?

161
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,982
Doing quite well, thank you.

162
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,493
Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg
and a quickie. You know what?

163
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:25,218
If I could add TV to the equation,
that would really be the ultimate.

164
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,474
George, we're trying to have
a civilization here.

165
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,907
Hey.
Hey, how was baby-sitting?

166
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:34,685
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian
has some kind of medical problem

167
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:38,278
and if the worst happens she wants me
to take care of Jimmy.

168
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,110
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
It doesn't matter.

169
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:47,518
If anything happens to her, I'm on deck!
Scissors mishap, air show disaster,

170
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:51,752
chinese organ thieves..
it's a dangerous world.

171
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,976
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out

172
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:59,041
on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
Really?

173
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:04,745
Look at this, look at the hair
on the back of my neck.

174
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:09,059
t's all bramble, see it's like
thicket back there.

175
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:12,248
Look, I need somebody to shave it
for me, huh?

176
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,244
I'm not touching that thing.

177
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,729
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised
and disappointed - blood brother.

178
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,711
Oh, no...
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood.

179
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:30,944
Listen to your pulse, hey buddy
-hey buddy -hey buddy...

180
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:33,910
Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
So, my blood is not enough.

181
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,244
Would you like a kidney too,
because I'll give it to you?

182
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:40,145
I'll rip it out right here and stack it
on the table!

183
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:45,535
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
No no no, I don't have time right now.

184
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:51,127
I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort
of an all over kind of thing, all right?

185
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,190
Hello?
Kramer called,

186
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:59,062
he told that you were in a hospital.
Kramer called you?

187
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:04,959
He calls every week. Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.

188
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:07,655
He says he's fine.
Tell him to eat a plum.

189
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,934
Jerry, you really have to take
better care of yourself.

190
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,679
e bought you some session with
a personal trainer.

191
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,846
I don't need a personal trainer.

192
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:18,934
all right I've got to go,
we'll talk about this later.

193
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:23,994
Plum..
Why are you calling my parents?

194
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,198
Well, maybe if you called more often,
I wouldn't have to.

195
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,190
Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
- Why here?

196
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,949
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament,
you know on C-Span.

197
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,910
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom,
cause your bed is really nice?

198
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:43,703
Fine...
Ok!

199
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:50,177
No no no no no no no no no no!
I do not want that in here!

200
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:53,986
Blood!
All right.

201
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,785
Hello, dough boy.

202
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:02,273
Mr. Mandelbaum? You're
the personal trainer?

203
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:07,241
I'm here to whip you in to shape,
so grab your jocks if you need one.

204
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,359
It's go-time.

205
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:17,086
Elaine? Elaine?
Oh, hi, oh God.

206
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,173
I didn't here you come in.
Where's Jimmy?

207
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,599
I don't know, I don't know...
we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...

208
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:28,120
and then he put this plastic
bag over his head

209
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,632
and started running
around until he got tired

210
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,448
and then he laid down somewhere I...

211
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:35,805
I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.

212
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:39,960
Sleeping like an angel.
Elaine, you're the best.

213
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,654
No! I'm a scatter brain.

214
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,928
That's why I probably can't hold
a job or keep a man!

215
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:48,122
Be quiet. So, will you watch
Jimmy tomorrow?

216
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:52,675
All right, but I'm running out
of purses here.

217
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,770
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum,
what you want me to do?

218
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,303
Drop your purse, and pick up
that medicine ball.

219
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,212
Is this a gym, or some kind
of fitness museum?

220
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,346
Not funny, over your head with it.
Are you ready?

221
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:14,659
For what?
All aboard in the pain train!

222
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:20,057
How many session did
my parents paid for?

223
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:23,498
Not enough to make a man
of you, daffodil.

224
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:37,386
Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho,
you're hot tonight!

225
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,553
Oh, George!
And now for the trifecta

226
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:57,962
George? George? What are you doing?!
Pleasuring you?

227
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,617
What is this?
We're making sausages.

228
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,474
I thought you were gonna watch
a video.

229
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:13,025
eah, an instructional video about
how to make your own sausages.

230
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:15,392
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
All right, all right.

231
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:19,630
Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks
and haul these beauties out of here.

232
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,518
Blood over there, sausages over here
I'm living in a slaughter house.

233
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:33,733
Tonight I want you to sleep on this.
Toughens the vertebrae.

234
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:40,836
What in holy hell? Sausages?
Is this your diet?

235
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:44,473
No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
Don't lie to me, butter bean.

236
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:47,294
We're taking it up a notch.

237
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:52,795
So, the free love buffet is over?
I got greedy.

238
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:56,340
Flew too close to the sun
on wings of pastrami.

239
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,862
Yeah, that's what you did...

240
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:04,179
I can't believe I got another session
with Izzy Mandelbaum,

241
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:06,645
he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.

242
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:10,949
What's going on?
I don't know.

243
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,916
This sandwich is making me flush.

244
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,620
Oh no, I'll tell you
what you did Caligula;

245
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:23,212
you combined food and sex in to one
disgusting uncontrollable urge.

246
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:26,620
I think you're right.
You gonna eat that?

247
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:29,612
No, but please tell me that's all
you're gonna do with it.

248
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:35,221
Jerry, I tell you: if this woman dies,
it is going to be a major inconvenience.

249
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,332
These fries are really really good..

250
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:41,707
All right, that's enough of that.
I mean I can't shake this woman.

251
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:44,231
You know, now I have to go
to Jimmy's birthday party.

252
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:50,309
Uuh, sleepy.
No matter what I do,

253
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,839
I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.

254
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,056
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel,
maybe he can bat for you.

255
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:59,278
Yeah, that's what I need:
a pinch weasel.

256
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:03,878
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.

257
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,070
Yeah well, Newman's not happy,
he booted me out of his freezer.

258
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:11,253
Look, I've got to take my blood back
to the bank, can I borrow your car?

259
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:12,644
What's wrong with yours?

260
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,398
I got no A/C and I gotta keep
the blood cold or it'll go bad.

261
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:18,228
All right, but this is it, this is
the last favor, we're even!

262
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:20,637
All right, Even Steven.

263
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:24,477
Oh, by the way, when you get back
to your apartment try to keep it down

264
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,485
because Newman is taking a nap
in your bed.

265
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,204
Oh, man..

266
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:53,628
"If the engine begins to overheat,
turn off air conditioner".

267
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,246
Never, I can't do that.

268
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:59,685
Oh, mama...

269
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,063
Shees, come on...

270
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,000
this thing is bone dry.

271
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,519
Vivian...
Elaine!

272
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:29,951
Hi! This is my friend George.
Hi...

273
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:32,456
I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
Ok.

274
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,638
You're up.
Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?

275
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,639
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be
seeing much more of her.

276
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,820
Really, why?
Oh, you haven't heard,

277
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,606
she's going to live with her grandparents
in Redding Pennsylvania.

278
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,366
Her grandparent passed away
five years ago.

279
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:51,486
Yes they did. I was covering.

280
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:55,077
Elaine has been deported back
to Scotland.

281
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:57,390
She's American citizen,
I have seen her passport.

282
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,566
All right, no more lies.

283
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,136
Elaine is been chosen
to represent the Upper

284
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,749
West Side in the next Biosphere project.

285
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,085
I haven't heard anything
about another Biosphere.

286
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:12,350
That's because it's underwater.
This is insane.

287
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:15,094
Is it?
Yes it it.

288
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,446
Well, it's all for charity,
so what's the difference.

289
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,405
You...very knowledgeable.

290
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,347
Well, I'm also an architect.

291
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:31,731
Is that pastrami?

292
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,044
Yes it is. I find the pastrami
to be  the most  sensual

293
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,533
of all the salted cured meats.

294
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:41,875
Hungry?
Very.

295
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:51,112
Oh, wait..Oohh...

296
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,132
Vivian!!

297
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:59,450
Is this really necessary?
If you wanna live in a butcher shop,

298
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:02,508
I'm gonna treat you like
a piece of meat.

299
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:07,728
What if I can't keep up?
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.

300
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:12,677
Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum..

301
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:18,619
Move it, move it!
Get those knees up!

302
00:16:57,944 --> 00:20:25,380
What's going on?

303
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:28,233
There's something wrong
with your car.

304
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:32,416
It's dripping something on my feet.
Some kind of red liquid.

305
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:36,119
Oh my God, the blood!
Blood!!

306
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:42,514
Get up boy, get up!
We got a problem here!

307
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:48,087
Tough it up. This is for real,
you've got to want it...

308
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:52,638
So how long did they drag you?

309
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,440
Well, for the first quarter mile they
thought that I was just doggin' it.

310
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,184
Hi George. Hi Jimmy.

311
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:05,775
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside,
you know, play with something.

312
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:09,439
Ouch!
What's the kid doing here?

313
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:11,494
I'm baby-sitting!

314
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:14,128
Vivian asked me to raise him
if she doesn't make it.

315
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:16,045
Oh, that's a drag...

316
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:19,129
That kid...
You put blood in the car?!

317
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:23,222
Jerry, it was overheating.
You should take better care of that thing.

318
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:26,014
Well, they told me that I got more blood,
so I guess I owe you again.

319
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,544
You didn't get the blood from me.
- Then who?

320
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,646
Hello Jerry.
- Aaaaahhh...!!!

321
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,256
Aaaahhh...!!!
