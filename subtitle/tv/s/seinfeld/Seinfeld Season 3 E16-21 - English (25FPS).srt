1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,688
I never really understood...

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:06,841
...the importance of the conductor.

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,604
Between you and me,
what the hell is this guy doing?

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,557
Do you really need somebody
waving a stick in your face...

5
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:17,766
...to play the violin?
Does that really help you out?

6
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:21,047
I could see how we need him
at the beginning, okay?

7
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:22,648
Tap, tap, tap.

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,807
"Start." Okay.
I could see how you need that.

9
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,166
But once we're going, okay.
Once it's all happening...

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,967
...what do we need him for then?

11
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,998
I don't see the cellist looking up,
"I'm confused. I don't know what to do."

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,047
And the conductor goes,
"Do this. Like this..."

13
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:41,803
"Oh, okay, thank you.
Thank you very much."

14
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:48,840
Why try anymore?
There's no sense to it.

15
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,965
I'll never meet anybody.
I should accept it.

16
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,245
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

17
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,719
Yeah, maybe you won't.

18
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,837
It's hard enough to meet a woman
you dislike, much less like.

19
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:03,845
- Are my nostrils getting bigger?
- No.

20
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,922
See, why must it be so difficult?
Why all this tension and hostility?

21
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:12,048
Why can't I just walk up to a woman
and say, " Hi, I'm George.

22
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,120
How are you?" Is that so terrible?

23
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,241
H... H... Hi.

24
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,600
Hi. Hi.

25
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:23,720
- There's no men out there.
- I know.

26
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:27,598
The problem is that the good ones
know they're good.

27
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,043
They know they're in demand.

28
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:32,326
They're not interested in confining
themselves to one person.

29
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,719
I hate the good ones.

30
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,038
Is Jerry a good one?

31
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,121
That's a good question.
I think he thinks he is.

32
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,361
The mediocre ones are available...

33
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:44,406
...but so insecure
about not being a good one...

34
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,605
...that they always go,
"I'm not good enough for you.

35
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,240
What are you doing with me?"
Eventually I just go, "You're right."

36
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:55,717
Maybe you need somebody
between good and mediocre.

37
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,686
No, maybe I need somebody
who has nothing.

38
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:01,762
Somebody who just appreciates being
with me because he's so desperate.

39
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:08,600
It's gotten to the point where I'm
flirting with operators on the phone.

40
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,444
I almost made a date with one.

41
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,042
Oh, so there's still hope.

42
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:17,520
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me.

43
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,563
My dream is to become hopeless.

44
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:21,923
The hopeless don't care.

45
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:24,762
When you don't care,
that indifference makes you attractive.

46
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,686
- So hopelessness is the key.
- It's my only hope.

47
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,524
You see, I wouldn't really mind
so much...

48
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,247
...but I feel badly for my mother.

49
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,843
If my mother weren't around,
it wouldn't be so bad.

50
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:39,922
But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married
by the time I'm 40, I'll have to kill her.

51
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,201
Because it's the only fair thing to do.

52
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,726
I just couldn't put her through that.

53
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:48,727
At least you're not bitter.

54
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,368
Who says I'm not bitter?

55
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:54,601
- Aren't you too young to be bitter?
- No, you can be young and bitter.

56
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:58,805
Just maybe not as bitter as I'll be
10 years from now.

57
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:01,001
But I'm bitter.

58
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,048
Anyway, don't tell anyone.

59
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,121
Don't worry. Your bitterness
is safe with me.

60
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:11,561
Okay. Order me a piece of cake.

61
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:13,601
I'm gonna go throw up.

62
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,403
Look at my hands.

63
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:22,968
Look.

64
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:25,162
Filthy from the paper.

65
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,323
They should give you a Wet-Nap when
you buy one, like at those rib joints.

66
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,123
- What did you do last night?
- Went out with George. You?

67
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,927
Went out with Cynthia.

68
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,443
What did you talk about?

69
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,642
Oh, you know, the usual.
The Federal Reserve, the rain forest.

70
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,280
Cynthia felt we should nuke
the rain forest.

71
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,441
Get rid of it in one fell swoop
so we could eliminate it...

72
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,486
...as a subject of conversation.

73
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,163
- What about you?
- We brushed on that.

74
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,088
Actually, George was in rare form.

75
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:01,558
He just can't find anybody.

76
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,242
I know. Cynthia too.

77
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,798
- She's really given up.
- George too.

78
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,358
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

79
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,722
- I've never fixed anybody up.
- Me neither.

80
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,279
And I am not about to
start with George.

81
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,243
Well, why wouldn't you start
with George?

82
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,967
You think she's too good for George?

83
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,001
I didn't say "too good," did I?

84
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,319
- You implied it.
- I didn't say it.

85
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:35,241
If you think she's too good
for George...

86
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,287
...you are dead wrong. Dead wrong.

87
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,082
Who is she?

88
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,559
- Who is he?
- He's George.

89
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:46,279
- She's Cynthia.
- So what?

90
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,519
What, you don't think
she's beautiful?

91
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,841
What's with the eyebrows?

92
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:56,842
You know what your problem is?
Your standards are too high.

93
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,562
I went out with you.

94
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:06,047
That's because my standards
are too low.

95
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:12,319
And by the way,
women kill for eyebrows like that.

96
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:16,368
Do you know that?
Women pluck their real eyebrows...

97
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,407
...out of their head one by one...

98
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,925
...until they're bald, Jerry,
bald above the eyes.

99
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,286
And then they paint in these eyebrows
to look like that.

100
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,644
Well, let me tell you something
about George.

101
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,765
He is fast.

102
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:33,279
He can run like the wind.

103
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:34,757
And he's strong.

104
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:37,887
I've seen him lift 100 pounds over
his head without even knowing it.

105
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:41,321
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but George can bait a hook.

106
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,799
- He can really do that?
- Come on, let's do it.

107
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,561
I think they'll really get along.

108
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,404
- What, are you into this?
- Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

109
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:52,322
Wait. They'll be telling us how
their dates went.

110
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:54,047
Are we gonna share
that information?

111
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,562
Naturally.

112
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:00,718
We're going to tell each other
everything? Every secret?

113
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,203
Everything.

114
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,603
- What if it worked out?
- Yeah, right

115
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,361
Out of the question.

116
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:12,042
Out of the question.

117
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,401
- Why?
- No. I'm not going to do that.

118
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,243
It's one step away from personal ads.

119
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,362
Then prostitutes.

120
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:23,885
No! No! I am not going
down that road.

121
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:31,086
What does she look like?

122
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,961
- She's good-looking.
- How good-looking?

123
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,881
- Very good-looking.
- Really good-looking?

124
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,404
- Really very good-looking.
- Would you take her out?

125
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,367
- Yes, I would.
- You hesitated.

126
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,124
- What hesitate? I didn't hesitate.
- Something's up. You hesitated.

127
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,439
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.

128
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,519
- What about the body?
- Good body. Nice body.

129
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,645
- How nice?
- Nice. Pretty nice.

130
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,080
- Really good?
- Really very nice and good.

131
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:03,037
- What about personality?
- Good personality.

132
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,081
Funny. Bright.

133
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,126
I don't want anyone smarter than me.

134
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,122
How could she be smarter than you?

135
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:18,081
All right, let's see. Let's see.
What else? What else?

136
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,087
What does she do?

137
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,241
First of all, what does he do?

138
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,047
He was in real estate.

139
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,439
He's not working right now.

140
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,123
Oh! He's not working?
No. No. No.

141
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,041
How come he's not working?

142
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,962
Well, I mean, he got fired.

143
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,323
Why did he get fired?

144
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:43,238
Oh, right. Well...

145
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,446
He tried to... poison his boss.

146
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:48,281
Excuse me?

147
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:53,559
It's such a long story. Seriously,
he just had some problems at work.

148
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,685
- Is he nuts?
- No, no, no.

149
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:59,000
He's a really, really funny guy.

150
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:00,523
What does he look like?

151
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,722
- Pardon?
- What does he look like?

152
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,477
Well, he's got a lot of character
in his face.

153
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:11,085
He's short. He's stocky.

154
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:12,443
He's fat.

155
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,327
Is that what you're saying,
that he's fat?

156
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:15,758
Powerful.

157
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:21,606
He is so powerful. He can lift
100 pounds right up over his head.

158
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,204
And, what else? What else?

159
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,758
Oh, right, well...

160
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:31,207
He's, he's kind of...
Just kind of... Losing his hair.

161
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,168
- He's bald?
- No.

162
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,321
No, no, no. He's not bald.

163
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,241
He's balding.

164
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,441
- So he will be bald?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,966
- What kind of hair?
- You know, long, dark hair.

166
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,528
Flowing?

167
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,923
Flowing?

168
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,208
Is it flowing? I like flowing,
cascading hair.

169
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,680
Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.

170
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,321
"Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me."

171
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,842
- Is that what you said?
- Right.

172
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,567
Just clarifying.

173
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,765
Let me ask you this.

174
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,088
If you stick your hand in the hair,
is it easy to get it out?

175
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:24,888
Do you want to get it out?

176
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,404
Or do you want to not be able
to get it out?

177
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,922
- I'd like to be able to get it out.
- I think you'll get it out.

178
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,202
What about the skin?

179
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:35,485
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

180
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:38,001
She's got a fine cheek.

181
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:39,728
Is there a pinkish hue?

182
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:46,648
- A pinkish hue?
- Yes, a rosy glow.

183
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,120
There's a hue.

184
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:53,319
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.

185
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:56,927
Who cares about eyebrows?

186
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:02,118
Is she sweet? I like sweet.

187
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,123
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.

188
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,445
I don't think you'll throw up.

189
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,924
She likes to throw up.

190
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,518
- Has he ever been married?
- No.

191
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:24,967
Has he been close?

192
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:28,367
He once spent a weekend
with a woman.

193
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:34,197
He didn't really try
to poison his boss.

194
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:36,127
Yeah, he did.

195
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,525
We had an incredible
phone conversation.

196
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,327
We talked for, like, 20 minutes.

197
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:47,242
I threw away my notes
in the middle of the call.

198
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,959
I thought she had
a great voice timbre.

199
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,482
Is it "timbre" or "tambre"?

200
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,607
- I think it's tambre.
- Why'd I think timbre?

201
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,202
She could do voice-overs.

202
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,882
You didn't tell me about her voice?

203
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:02,927
- I didn't notice the voice.
- It's mellifluous.

204
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,562
So, Saturday night.

205
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,879
She had to be impressed
by that conversation.

206
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,802
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.

207
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:15,485
On the date, they should just have two
phones on the table at the restaurant.

208
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,007
- Hi.
- Hi!

209
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,046
- Out we go Saturday night.
- I know.

210
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,248
- So, what did she say?
- You're getting together Saturday night.

211
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,800
- That's it?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,286
- She didn't mention the conversation?
- No.

213
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,120
See? I don't get that.

214
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,040
We had a relaxed, stimulating, great
conversation. She doesn't mention it?

215
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:42,403
- Why not mention it?
- What?

216
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,082
She could have mentioned it.

217
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,400
All right. All right. I'll go on the date,
but that's that.

218
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,600
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?

219
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:58,921
- The guy from Jersey.
- He just got a job at a condom factory.

220
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,005
Look at this. He gave me a gross.

221
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:08,481
- What will you do with all of them?
- Oh, well...

222
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,408
Take some, Jerry. Grab them.

223
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,288
No, thanks. They look like
they came out of a cereal box.

224
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:21,566
Come on, Elaine, here.
Take half a bag.

225
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,605
Half a bag?

226
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:27,079
What am I, a hooker?

227
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:30,839
Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

228
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll take one.

229
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,288
It's possible.

230
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:44,118
The problem with the condom
is still buying them.

231
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:48,521
I think we should have, like,
a secret signal with the druggist.

232
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,283
You walk into the store,
go to the counter. He looks at you.

233
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,167
And if you go like this:

234
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,444
He puts them in the bag
for you. That's it.

235
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:01,040
Show up there with your little
shaving cream, your little toothpaste.

236
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:02,642
"How are you today?"

237
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,358
"Have a nice day." "You too."

238
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,408
So where are they? It's 11:45.
They should be back by now.

239
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:16,129
- What did they do?
- I think they went out to dinner.

240
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,479
Oh, wait. I got another call.
That must be him.

241
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,287
- Hello.
- It's me. I just got home.

242
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,802
Hold on.

243
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:25,002
- It's George. He just got home.
- Yeah. I got Cynthia on the line.

244
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,923
- I'll call you back when I'm done.
- Remember our pact: full disclosure.

245
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:30,681
Of course.

246
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:32,523
Yeah, go ahead.

247
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,683
I'm gonna tell you,
but I made a pact with Cynthia.

248
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,805
We swore we wouldn't tell
you and Elaine.

249
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:40,039
- You can tell. I'll vault it.
- It's in the vault?

250
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,167
I'm locking the vault. What? Come on.

251
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,088
- We had sex.
- Oh, my God, you had sex?

252
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:48,967
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

253
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,721
I closed my eyes and made a move.

254
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:52,163
- At your apartment?
- Yeah.

255
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,206
- She didn't stay over?
- No. She left.

256
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,929
Listen, you can't mention
any of this to Elaine.

257
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,683
Cynthia will kill me. We made a deal.

258
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,323
Oh, my God.

259
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,639
He was uncomfortable
because it was our first time.

260
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,881
So he felt he'd perform better
if we did it in the kitchen.

261
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:08,721
- What?
- He says the kitchen...

262
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,641
...is the most sociable room
in the house.

263
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,037
And he was serious.

264
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:15,208
- So how was it?
- How good could it be?

265
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,519
My head was on a hot plate.

266
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:19,881
I got another call. Must be Jerry.

267
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:23,359
- Oh, don't you tell him any of this.
- Yeah, okay.

268
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:27,157
- Hello?
- So, what did she say?

269
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,127
- What did he have to say?
- He said he had a good time.

270
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,599
- Her too.
- Oh, good.

271
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,282
- Anything else?
- No.

272
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,799
- You?
- No.

273
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,439
- You sure?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,609
- You?
- Yeah.

275
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,888
All right, well...

276
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,639
I guess everything is under control.

277
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:52,004
Yeah. Okay then.

278
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:53,443
Alrighty.

279
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,128
- Good night.
- Good night.

280
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,920
I left three messages.
I can't believe this woman.

281
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,479
We have sex, she leaves 10 minutes
later, then I never hear from her again.

282
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,287
What kind of a person does this?

283
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,602
She used me. I feel cheap and violated.

284
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,483
- I'm gonna do something about this.
- What are you gonna do?

285
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,560
Never mind. Disgraceful.

286
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:25,484
Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen
floor like some kind of roach trap.

287
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,965
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

288
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,245
Sir. Whatever.

289
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:32,606
She's not gonna get away with this.

290
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,239
I keep racking my brain
to try to figure out what I did.

291
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,161
I was smart. I was funny.

292
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:40,240
I made great small talk
with the waitress...

293
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,877
...so she could see I could relate
to the commoners.

294
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,721
I'm a man of the people.

295
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,442
- I'm gonna call her.
- Don't call.

296
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,362
- No, I'm calling her.
- No, Jerry, I don't want you to.

297
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,565
- Get away from me.
- Give me the phone.

298
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,687
- You wanna fight me?
- Jerry, I'm gonna kill you.

299
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,680
Hey, hey, hey!

300
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:58,567
Hey, come on, Jerry, George.
Stop it.

301
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,282
I'll just call her when you leave.

302
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:01,643
It's none of your business!

303
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,959
- It is so my business.
- Give me that!

304
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,881
Stop it, boys!

305
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,687
I don't want another word
from either of you.

306
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:12,965
- Tell him...
- Hey, hey, hey!

307
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,877
The next one of you that opens your
mouth, you'll have to deal with me.

308
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:23,522
I bet I know what this is about.
It's about a woman, isn't it?

309
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,328
- Yeah, but...
- You see!

310
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,320
This is exactly what they want
to do to you.

311
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,241
They play one against the other.

312
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,326
You can't let them
manipulate you like that.

313
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:32,842
- But, Kramer...
- No, no, no!

314
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,727
I want you guys to shake hands.

315
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:37,563
Come on, there are plenty women
out there for all of us.

316
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:38,958
Shake.

317
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,001
Yes! You see?

318
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,842
Isn't that better than fighting?
Animosity?

319
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,887
You wanna fight with somebody,
you fight with me.

320
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:52,288
By the way, those condoms I gave you?
They're defective. Don't use them.

321
00:16:58,769 --> 00:16:59,918
- What?
- Yeah.

322
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:01,920
- Defective?
- Defective.

323
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,398
How could you give me
a defective condom?

324
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,560
I didn't even know
they were defective.

325
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,799
- Didn't think you'd use them.
- What do you mean...?!

326
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,158
Take it easy.

327
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,206
Just spread out!

328
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,402
Don't worry. If anything was wrong,
she'd have called you.

329
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,642
I missed my period.

330
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:30,842
Oh, my God!

331
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:34,684
I am very worried. I am never late.

332
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,681
But he used a condom, right?

333
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,602
I know, but these things
aren't always foolproof.

334
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,765
Oh, no.

335
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:45,723
What?

336
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,242
Was it blue?

337
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,079
Yeah. How'd you know?

338
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,087
Just a hunch.

339
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:02,967
It says "twist-off."
Twist off! Twist! Off!

340
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:06,725
Oh, hi. Soda?

341
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:08,962
No, thanks.

342
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:11,527
So tell me.

343
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:15,318
What's the problem with your little
flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?

344
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:18,126
Who are you to talk
about her like that?

345
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,166
She'll call him when she's
good and ready.

346
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:22,280
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, I know her.

347
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:23,757
I know her type.

348
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,439
Her type? What type?

349
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,088
The type that doesn't return calls.

350
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:31,400
I knew we shouldn't have done it.
It was a bad idea. I told you.

351
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,402
You told me? You pushed
this whole thing on me.

352
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:35,843
It was your idea.

353
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:38,239
I was just helping your bitter,
twisted friend.

354
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:39,963
She's not bitter.

355
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:41,881
Bitter's a judgment call.
She's twisted.

356
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,325
Twisted? God, I did you a favour!

357
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:48,287
You said they had a good time.
What else are you keeping from me?

358
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:51,088
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I'm calling you one if you are.

359
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:53,080
- Are you?
- Get your finger out of my face.

360
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,285
- Get yours out.
- I don't care.

361
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,804
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

362
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,563
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, stop it!

363
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:02,640
Come on. Break it up!

364
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,637
Hey, hey!

365
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:07,086
What's the matter with you?

366
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,685
Now, don't you two see
that you're in love with each other?

367
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,165
I mean, why can't you
face that already?

368
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:20,048
You're running around looking
for something not even there...

369
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:23,281
...when everything you dream of
is right here in front of you.

370
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,246
Now why can't you admit that?

371
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:28,762
By the way, when you see George,
give him these. These'll work.

372
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:33,726
I knew those condoms
were defective!

373
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,928
How did you know
they were defective?!

374
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,361
Because! Because she missed
her period!

375
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,959
She missed her period?

376
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:49,001
Oh, my God!

377
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,127
I can't believe it.

378
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:54,003
I'm a father! I did it!

379
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:55,682
My boys can swim!

380
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,808
I can do it! I can do it!
I'm a father!

381
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:07,487
So he shows up. He's all out of breath.
He's dishevelled.

382
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:11,847
And tells me that whatever happens,
whatever I decide is fine with him...

383
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:13,848
...and I could depend on him...

384
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,126
...and that he'd support me
in whatever way I need.

385
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,009
Elaine, I was speechless.

386
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,640
Wow. Wow. You see?
You think you know somebody.

387
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,358
I said to him, " I really appreciate this,
but I just got my period."

388
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,121
- Yeah.
- So I asked him to come in...

389
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,608
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

390
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:34,842
Sorry we're late. We got so
hung up in traffic. I'm sorry.

391
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,645
- What happened?
- Acting.

392
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,764
- Very mature.
- Thank you.

393
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,082
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Hi.

394
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,524
This is a great place to sit
you got here.

395
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,919
Best seat in the house.
Right next to the kitchen.

396
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

397
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,402
- So, what are these?
- We ordered appetizers. Start eating.

398
00:20:57,969 --> 00:20:59,402
Oh, fabulous.

399
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,520
This is good. Oh, this is good.

400
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,479
Is that salt on this?

401
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,767
Is there salt on this?

402
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,806
But have you ever fixed anybody up?

403
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:13,800
Why do we do it? Why?

404
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,881
You thought
they'd have a good time...

405
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,005
...and a little power trip
for you, isn't it?

406
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:19,957
Now you're playing God.

407
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:23,087
Of course, God was
the first person to fix people up.

408
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,080
He fixed up Adam and Eve.

409
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,046
I'm sure he said to Adam,
"No, she's nice.

410
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:32,522
She's... Yes, she's very free
about her body.

411
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:34,759
Doesn't really wear much.

412
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:38,080
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over, though."

413
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,000

414
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:32,987
Do you think that the people
at the airport...

415
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:36,154
...that run the stores
have any idea...

416
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:39,149
...what the prices are everyplace else
in the world...

417
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,353
...or do they just feel they have
their own little country out there...

418
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:44,347
...and they can charge
anything they want?

419
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:47,428
"You hungry? Tuna sandwich is $9.

420
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:50,269
You don't like it,
go back to your own country."

421
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:52,706
I think the whole
airport-airline complex...

422
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:56,027
...is a huge scam just to sell
the tuna sandwiches.

423
00:22:56,196 --> 00:23:00,030
I think that profit is what's supporting
the whole air travel industry.

424
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,790
I mean, think about it.
The terminals, the airplanes...

425
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:04,469
...it's all just a distraction...

426
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:07,708
...so that you don't notice the beating
that you're taking on the tuna.

427
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:16,266
It's all departures.
I see nothing but departures.

428
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,427
Do you know where the arrivals are?

429
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:23,548
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

430
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,146
There's a clock over there.

431
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:28,432
- Where?
- Over there.

432
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:32,750
- But you have a watch on.
- It's right by the escalator.

433
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:34,835
Why not just look at your watch?

434
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:37,386
I told you, it's right over there.

435
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:40,872
- Let me see the watch.
- Hey!

436
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,594
What are you, some kind of nut?

437
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,595
You know, we're living in a society!

438
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:50,586
- George.
- Jerry, Jerry.

439
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:52,747
The flight was delayed.
How long you been here?

440
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,635
I just got here. My car broke down
on the Belt Parkway.

441
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:57,866
I can't believe...
Get rid of that piece of junk.

442
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,869
One mile from the exit,
it starts shaking, violently shaking...

443
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:02,708
...like it's having
a nervous breakdown.

444
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,595
- Then it completely stopped dead.
- So you have no car.

445
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:07,792
- No.
- So, what good are you?

446
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:12,426
This chauffeur's gonna be
waiting a while.

447
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:14,666
- O'Brien's not showing up.
- How do you know?

448
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:16,588
He was in Chicago.
Flight was overbooked.

449
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:17,950
They wouldn't let him on.

450
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:21,267
He kept screaming how he had
to get to Madison Square Garden.

451
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:23,631
- We should take his limo.
- Yeah, right.

452
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,635
Wait a second. Think about it.

453
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,869
He's not showing up.

454
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,596
Wait till you see the line for cabs.
It's 45 minutes long.

455
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,555
- You said he's in Chicago.
- He's definitely in Chicago.

456
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:40,348
Well, that guy is just standing there.

457
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:45,589
- How would we do it?
- Just go up and say, "We're O'Brien."

458
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:49,632
- Maybe he knows O'Brien.
- He doesn't know him.

459
00:24:49,796 --> 00:24:52,310
If he knew O'Brien,
he wouldn't have a sign.

460
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:55,430
- Let's just do it.
- What if we get caught?

461
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:58,110
What's gonna happen?
They can't kill us.

462
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:01,988
- Who's gonna be O'Brien?
- I'll be O'Brien.

463
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,271
- Who am I?
- You're you.

464
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,154
- Just me?
- Yeah.

465
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,436
- Okay.
- You don't wanna be you?

466
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,474
Well, if you're gonna be O'Brien,
why can't I be somebody?

467
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:17,709
- Like who?
- Dylan Murphy.

468
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:20,674
Okay.

469
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:24,515
- Now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
- Well, I like Dylan.

470
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,024
You could be Colin.

471
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:27,630
Okay. Colin O'Brien.

472
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:30,026
- I'm Dylan Murphy.
- I'm Colin O'Brien.

473
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,752
- Are we really doing this?
- Come on.

474
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:36,914
- Hey, do you have the time?
- Clock over there.

475
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,789
- O'Brien.
- Yes, sir.

476
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:41,949
Sorry we're late.

477
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:43,868
- Let me take that for you.
- Oh, thank you.

478
00:25:44,036 --> 00:25:46,948
- I'll bring the car around front.
- Thank you very much.

479
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:49,954
- Dylan.
- Colin.

480
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:56,593
Can you believe this?
This is incredible.

481
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,065
This is one of the greatest things
I've ever done.

482
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,306
- I'm gonna call my mother.
- What for?

483
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,546
To tell her I'm in a limo.

484
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:07,553
Hello, Ma? It's me.

485
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:11,026
Guess where I am.
In the back of a limo.

486
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,834
No, nobody died.

487
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:15,671
It's a long story. I can't tell you now.

488
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:17,155
Because I can't.

489
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:18,908
I said, I can't.

490
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:21,827
If I could, I would.

491
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:24,826
Would you stop it? All right, look...

492
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:26,224
I'm getting off.

493
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:29,468
No, I'm not telling you.
How's this? I'm never telling you.

494
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:31,752
I don't care. No! Fine!

495
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,668
Never!

496
00:26:36,516 --> 00:26:38,268
She happy for you?

497
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:41,628
- Can he hear us?
- No.

498
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:42,945
Why?

499
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,232
Thought I saw him look
in the mirror suspiciously.

500
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,715
He can't hear us.

501
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:48,675
Let's test him.

502
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:50,990
Hey, driver.

503
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:53,716
What do you say we stop off,
pick up your sister...

504
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:55,389
...have a little fun back here?

505
00:26:57,436 --> 00:26:58,915
No. He can't hear us.

506
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:02,912
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we
can get him to drop us at my house.

507
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,589
I'll ask him.

508
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:09,150
My dear fellow,
where are you dropping us?

509
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:12,274
At Madison Square Garden, of course.
I have the four passes.

510
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:15,391
Of course, the four passes.

511
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:20,747
Four passes to
Madison Square Garden?

512
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:23,105
Wait a minute.

513
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:24,868
Wait a minute. Of course.

514
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:26,230
Chicago!

515
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,307
The Knicks are playing
the Bulls tonight!

516
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:30,944
- What?
- We are going to the Knick game!

517
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,186
- Michael Jordan!
- The Knicks!

518
00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:35,347
We're going to the game!
Four free passes!

519
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:39,065
- Did I tell you? Did I tell you?
- I can't believe it!

520
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,306
- You may have hit with this one.
- You see?

521
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:45,389
You see, I see things as they are
and I say, "No."

522
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:49,791
Wait. You see things
as they are not and you say...

523
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:52,027
Wait. You see thing...

524
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:53,754
Do you see things as they are?

525
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,508
What do you say
when you see things?

526
00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:57,794
Let me call Elaine and Kramer.

527
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:03,071
If I see things as they are,
I would ask, "Why?" or "Why not?"

528
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:05,625
Elaine? It's me.

529
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:07,115
What are you doing tonight?

530
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:10,905
Great. George and I have tickets...
Four free passes...

531
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:14,307
...to the Knicks-Bulls game
at Madison Square Garden.

532
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,424
Can you go?

533
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,986
Great. Call Kramer, tell him to meet
us on the corner at 7:00.

534
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,307
All right. We're gonna
pick you up in a limo.

535
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:25,831
That's right, baby doll.

536
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,989
And listen, when we pick you up,
I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien.

537
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:32,272
I can't tell you now. It's a long story.

538
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:34,074
I am serious.

539
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:36,113
Okay. Okay, bye.

540
00:28:41,156 --> 00:28:43,875
Excuse me, driver,
we have to make a little stop first.

541
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:45,310
I know.

542
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:49,589
- He knows?
- He knows?

543
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:55,987
Where we going?
Why are we pulling off here?

544
00:28:56,156 --> 00:28:57,555
Maybe it's a shortcut.

545
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,276
We're on the Grand Central.
There's no traffic.

546
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:03,946
Excuse me,
why are we getting off this exit?

547
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:06,311
To pick up the other members
of your party.

548
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:09,151
Right. The other members
of our party.

549
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:12,907
What other members
of our party?

550
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:14,907
I didn't even know
we were in a party.

551
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:16,429
I'm telling you, the jig is up.

552
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,746
It was a bad jig.
We never should've started it.

553
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:22,352
- It was a good jig.
- It was a bad jig. A terrible, terrible jig.

554
00:29:22,516 --> 00:29:25,076
What are we gonna do now?
They'll know you're not O'Brien.

555
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:27,670
There could be more than one O'Brien
who ordered a limo.

556
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:30,748
- First, you don't look like any O'Brien.
- You should've been O'Brien.

557
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:33,066
I don't wanna be Murphy anymore.
Do I have to be?

558
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:36,069
- Yes, you have to be Murphy.
- It makes no sense, me being Murphy.

559
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:37,555
- You're Murphy.
- I'm Seinfeld.

560
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:39,035
You're Murphy!

561
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:40,989
Let's just jump out of the car.

562
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,953
We're doing 60 miles an hour.

563
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,471
So we jump and roll.
You won't get hurt.

564
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:47,547
Who are you, Mannix?

565
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,110
Why are we slowing down?

566
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:51,388
Are those the people?

567
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:55,074
All right, put your hands up over
your face. Pretend you're sleeping.

568
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:06,469
- Mr. O'Brien.
- No, I'm Dylan Murphy.

569
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:08,513
Mr. O'Brien had a long trip.
He's sleeping.

570
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:11,955
I don't wanna disturb him.

571
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:16,312
We're just really excited to meet him
face-to-face finally.

572
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,986
We're faithful readers
of his newsletter.

573
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,310
- Newsletter?
- And, of course, his great book...

574
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:24,795
...The Big Game.

575
00:30:25,316 --> 00:30:29,468
Oh, yes, he's very proud
of his work in The Big Game.

576
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:33,473
- So you've never met him before?
- No.

577
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:36,512
- Never seen a picture of him?
- Never.

578
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,269
Not even on the book jacket?

579
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,832
There was no picture
on the book jacket.

580
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:44,113
Hey, O'Brien, wake up. Come on.
We got company.

581
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,789
Wake up.

582
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:52,506
Well, hello. I'm O'Brien.

583
00:30:56,636 --> 00:30:59,070
- Hey!
- Hey.

584
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:01,147
You took a cab?

585
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:02,995
Yeah. So?

586
00:31:03,156 --> 00:31:04,475
How much do you make?

587
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:05,989
- I'm not telling you.
- Come on.

588
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,033
- No.
- I'll tell you how much I make.

589
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:09,675
I know how much you make.

590
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:15,189
I don't even know why I'm doing this.
I don't even like basketball.

591
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:18,513
- You ever seen Michael Jordan?
- Just in those commercials.

592
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,588
Maybe you'll see him do
one of those 360 dunks.

593
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:23,230
- What's that?
- It's like this.

594
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:25,148
- Here, you guard me.
- What?

595
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,986
I never get the tinted windows
on the limo.

596
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:40,555
Nobody cares who's in the limo.

597
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:43,105
You see a limo go by,
you know it's either a rich guy...

598
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,232
...or 50 prom kids with $1.75 each.

599
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:50,431
Being in the back of a limo,
I'm sorry, it's just...

600
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:52,951
It's not that cool.
Most of the time, you feel like...

601
00:31:53,116 --> 00:31:56,791
...you're in some depressing single
guy's apartment from, like, 1975.

602
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,629
All that maroon velour furniture...

603
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:02,754
...couple of bottles of wine,
three cassette tapes. There's stains.

604
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:05,988
You're counting, there must've been
10,000 asses already on this seat.

605
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:09,628
- I don't think we'll make the tip-off.
- Think someone's been tipped off?

606
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:14,914
So...

607
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:17,192
You've read The Big Game,
have you?

608
00:32:17,356 --> 00:32:19,824
Yes, I've read it.
And I've memorized it.

609
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:21,949
Well, tell me your impressions.

610
00:32:22,116 --> 00:32:25,313
I would love to hear what a young
woman thinks of The Big Game.

611
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,468
Well, this is sort of embarrassing.

612
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:31,226
But it's changed my life.

613
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,307
The way you analyse the game...

614
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:37,469
...the way you identify
the major players...

615
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:40,104
Well, it left me breathless.

616
00:32:40,396 --> 00:32:42,148
You're a brilliant...

617
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:44,352
...brilliant man.

618
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,471
Well, it's... It's just a game.

619
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:50,069
Remember that, kids.

620
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:52,830
"Just a game." He's so humble.

621
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,066
Don't forget what you wrote
in the epilogue:

622
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:59,070
"The fate of the world depends
on the outcome of this game."

623
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:02,276
Well, I was exaggerating a bit.
Just for effect.

624
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:05,872
- He tends to exaggerate.
- I mean, it's serious, but...

625
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:09,870
We are really looking forward
to your speech tonight.

626
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:12,749
My speech.

627
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:15,988
Yes, your secretary
faxed me the copy.

628
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:19,272
Would you like to
look it over?

629
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,827
Well, you might as well
look it over.

630
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,272
So, what's going on?
How did all this happen?

631
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:29,347
Jerry and George called me
from this limo.

632
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:31,711
They said we're all going
to the Knicks-Bulls game.

633
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,025
Limo?

634
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:35,107
I thought that George went
to pick him up.

635
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:36,470
He did.

636
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:38,866
Then why would they take a limo
from the airport?

637
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:40,185
I don't know.

638
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,867
That's pretty strange.

639
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:44,594
Did he say anything else?

640
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,111
Yeah. He said it's really important...

641
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,746
...that we call them
O'Brien and Murphy.

642
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:55,268
O'Brien? Why would he
wanna be called O'Brien?

643
00:33:56,876 --> 00:34:00,869
"And the Jews steal our money...

644
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,869
...through their
Zionist-occupied government...

645
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:07,108
...and use the black man
to bring drugs...

646
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:11,064
...into our oppressed
white minority communities."

647
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,071
You're not gonna open with that,
are you?

648
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:26,590
What was that you said
about the myth of the Holocaust?

649
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,110
Said so many things.

650
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:32,668
They're shooting! They're shooting!

651
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,428
All right, get down.

652
00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:45,431
I'm ready to die for you.

653
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:50,468
Oh, that's really very nice of you,
Eva, thank you.

654
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:52,592
But of course, you know, I would.

655
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:55,145
I would do anything for you.

656
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:57,155
Anything.

657
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:00,587
Nothing to worry about,
it was a flat tire.

658
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,429
But rest assured...

659
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:06,226
...we're prepared to handle anything
that might come up.

660
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:15,354
Nice-looking Luger.

661
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,466
I'm at The Paramount,
adjacent to Madison Square Garden...

662
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,628
...where a growing number of
angry demonstrators...

663
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:26,072
...gather to protest the first public
appearance of Donald O'Brien...

664
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:29,034
...leader of the Midwestern
regional chapter of the Aryan Union...

665
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:31,664
...and reputed to be their most
charismatic spokesman.

666
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:35,306
Mr. O'Brien advocates the
violent overthrow of the government.

667
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:38,673
He has openly professed
a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler.

668
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,396
Even David Duke has denounced him
as a dangerous extremist.

669
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,514
There is a full house inside
awaiting his arrival from the airport.

670
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:48,112
Sources tell me he is en route
and should be arriving momentarily.

671
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,744
Police have set up barricades,
but, quite frankly, Bill...

672
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:54,113
...I don't think they're any match for
the emotional fuse that has been lit.

673
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:57,791
From The Paramount, I'm Jodi
Baskerville. Back to you in the studio.

674
00:35:58,236 --> 00:35:59,908
Something's very strange here.

675
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:02,112
George goes to the airport
to pick up Jerry.

676
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:05,313
They come back in a limo with
four tickets to the basketball game...

677
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:07,228
...and wanna be called
O'Brien and Murphy.

678
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:11,308
O'Brien. O'Brien. Why O'Brien?

679
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:13,550
Elaine?

680
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:16,033
- Dan.
- Excuse me a minute. Hey.

681
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:19,586
- Hi, Dan. How are you?
- Good.

682
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:23,232
- Oh, this is Kramer.
- Oh, Kramer.

683
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:26,390
What's going on?

684
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,992
We're headed down to protest
this big neo-Nazi rally.

685
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:32,829
The head of the Aryan Union
is speaking. He's in from Chicago.

686
00:36:32,996 --> 00:36:35,749
- You should come.
- Oh, we can't.

687
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,827
We're going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

688
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,466
Oh, well, that's where the rally is.
At The Paramount, right next door.

689
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:45,072
- Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
- Yeah, it's really gonna be something.

690
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,148
First time he's appeared in public.
No one knows what he looks like.

691
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:50,671
- Who?
- The head of the Aryan Union.

692
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,155
O'Brien.

693
00:36:57,796 --> 00:36:59,866
What's taking them
so long out there?

694
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:02,793
Did you see the way
she was looking at me?

695
00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:07,155
- She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi.
- I know, I know.

696
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,269
Kind of a cute Nazi, though.

697
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:12,509
We gotta make a plan.

698
00:37:12,676 --> 00:37:14,234
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

699
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,513
- Let's just make a run for it.
- I can't run. I have a bad hamstring.

700
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:19,667
- How'd that happen?
- I hurt it in a hotel room.

701
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,304
Know how they tuck the covers in
real tight in those rooms?

702
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:25,149
I can't sleep like that.
I tried to kick it out and pulled it.

703
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:28,592
Why do they make that bed so tight?
You gotta sleep with your feet like that:

704
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:33,591
It's for a mental patient. Wait a minute,
the phone. We'll call the police.

705
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:35,390
911.

706
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:39,473
She said she'd do anything.

707
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:41,945
Yeah, hello. Police?
Yeah, listen...

708
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,266
...we're in the back of a limo
in Queens...

709
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:46,509
AstroTurf?

710
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:48,707
You know who's
responsible for that, don't you?

711
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:50,628
The Jews!

712
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:53,947
Oh, the Jews hate grass.
They always have, always will.

713
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:56,186
We'll be ready in a minute.

714
00:37:56,356 --> 00:37:58,074
Would you excuse us a minute,
Tim Boy?

715
00:37:58,236 --> 00:37:59,874
We're in the middle
of something here.

716
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:02,948
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien,
we're just about to leave.

717
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:11,148
Tim?

718
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:13,307
Who's the head of the Aryan Union?

719
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:15,387
- You or me?
- You are.

720
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:18,195
And who is responsible
for making hatemongering...

721
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:21,075
...and fascism popular again?
- You are.

722
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:23,948
Okay?

723
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:26,275
I think you forgot something.

724
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:28,714
- I'm sorry.
- Good.

725
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,269
Now get out.

726
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,864
- All right, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

727
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:38,789
How's this: we wait till we get
to your street corner...

728
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:40,867
...we see Elaine and Kramer,
then we get out.

729
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:43,072
- They can't shoot us in the city.
- No.

730
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:45,113
No one's ever been shot in the city.

731
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:50,386
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

732
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:53,150
I can feel it, sense it.

733
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:57,027
- I'm sure he was just joking around.
- Oh, no, this is no joke.

734
00:38:57,196 --> 00:39:00,586
O'Brien's coming in from Chicago.
Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien.

735
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,075
That's not funny.

736
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,634
Oh, my God.

737
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,347
Yes. Yes!

738
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,188
What? What is it?

739
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,312
Don't you see?
There's always been something...

740
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:18,105
...very strange about Jerry.
Always so clean and organized.

741
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:20,471
- So?
- Do I have to spell it out for you?

742
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:22,354
The limo? The name?

743
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:24,666
The rally at Madison Square Garden?

744
00:39:24,836 --> 00:39:27,714
Jerry and O'Brien
are the same person.

745
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:30,470
Jerry is the leader
of the Aryan Union.

746
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:31,830
Jerry's a Nazi?

747
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:35,232
I can't even believe I didn't see it.

748
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:38,911
Listen, you idiot, just calm down.

749
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,510
I know Jerry. He's not a Nazi.

750
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:44,873
- You don't think so?
- No. He's just neat.

751
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:53,270
You know, it's funny.

752
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:55,555
You don't look like an O'Brien.

753
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:57,315
Me?

754
00:39:57,476 --> 00:40:00,627
Yeah, right. Get a load of this guy.

755
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:05,395
- And you don't look like a Murphy.
- I may not look like one...

756
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:08,992
...but I act like a Murphy.
- He's extremely Murphy. To a fault.

757
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:10,590
Where are you from?

758
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:13,152
Dublin. Originally.

759
00:40:13,316 --> 00:40:16,228
Parents came over here
when I was 18.

760
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:17,590
Cereal famine.

761
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:20,350
Couldn't get a bowl anywhere.
It was bad.

762
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:22,347
'Tis a beautiful country, though.

763
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:26,065
Lush rolling hills. And the peat.

764
00:40:26,236 --> 00:40:27,589
The peat.

765
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:30,274
Sounds more like Scottish.

766
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:32,028
We were right on the border.

767
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:35,995
Maybe he's with the company.

768
00:40:36,676 --> 00:40:38,268
- What?
- The CIA.

769
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,429
Maybe they placed him in there to
infiltrate the organization from within.

770
00:40:42,596 --> 00:40:44,985
- What about his comedy act?
- That's the perfect cover.

771
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,914
All that time on the road.

772
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:49,670
Look, Jerry, he's too normal
to be a comedian.

773
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:51,986
These comedians,
they're sick, neurotic people.

774
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:54,990
- Well, what about George?
- What about him? He's part of it.

775
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:58,228
His whole personality's a disguise.

776
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:00,512
There's no real person
can act the way he does.

777
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,231
Elaine, I'm telling you,
they're with the organization.

778
00:41:03,396 --> 00:41:04,829
They're all part of it.

779
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,193
He's in there with Helms and Hunt
and Liddy, that whole crowd.

780
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:10,711
George and Jerry, they probably know
who killed Kennedy.

781
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,355
I bet they were even in on it.

782
00:41:14,836 --> 00:41:17,111
All right, what are we gonna do?
What...?

783
00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:20,029
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
I'm not gonna...

784
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:21,948
Kramer, you're hurting me.

785
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:24,671
Those are our friends
I told you about.

786
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:27,145
- Get off of me!
- We're gonna talk to them. Pull over.

787
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:28,908
- Get off of me!
- It's all right.

788
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:31,146
- Get off!
- Hey, O'Brien!

789
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:32,510
- O'Brien!
- Is that him?

790
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:34,428
- Yeah, that's him!
- Look, there's O'Brien!

791
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:35,824
No-good Nazi bastard!

792
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,315
- Let's get him!
- Get him!

793
00:41:37,476 --> 00:41:39,068
- What do we do?
- Get in the car!

794
00:41:39,236 --> 00:41:41,431
- Get in the car!
- What? What?

795
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:43,384
Come on, hey!

796
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:52,635
O'Brien. Long time, no see.
How's tricks, Murphy?

797
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:56,834
Why did you call him O'Brien
and him Murphy?

798
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:59,874
No, he was talking to me.
He's cross-eyed.

799
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:01,628
It could be very confusing.

800
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,105
Yeah?

801
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:10,071
- Eva?
- It's for me.

802
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:13,230
Hello?

803
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:18,188
It's O'Brien.

804
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,510
O'Brien?

805
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,190
Well, that's weird.

806
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:25,870
Who are you?

807
00:42:27,436 --> 00:42:29,233
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
- I'm George Costanza.

808
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:30,624
This is a misunderstanding.

809
00:42:30,796 --> 00:42:32,548
His car broke down.
I told him to get...

810
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:35,065
My car started shaking violently
about a mile out.

811
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:37,796
- So he picks me up without a car.
- And there was a line...

812
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,230
The limo has just pulled up.

813
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:41,626
It's being surrounded by
a huge crowd of protesters.

814
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,707
This has the makings of
a very ugly scene.

815
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:45,628
I just didn't have
anything to do tonight.

816
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,514
Then the phone rang
and it was Jerry.

817
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:50,509
We just wanted a ride
into the city.

818
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:53,065
He was supposed to pick me up,
but he didn't pick me up.

819
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:55,511
And tonight we were gonna go
to the basketball game...

820
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:57,826
They're banging on the car,
trying to flip it over.

821
00:42:57,996 --> 00:43:01,068
The police seem unable
or unwilling to control the crowd.

822
00:43:01,236 --> 00:43:04,148
I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be
having some very grave doubts...

823
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:06,830
...if he made the right choice
for his first appearance.

824
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:09,385
We did not want to
antagonize the Nazis.

825
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:11,467
We have no intention
of upsetting the Nazis.

826
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:14,196
- I don't have a problem with Nazis.
- Do whatever you want.

827
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:19,384
- Don't bother us, we won't bother you.
- I don't wanna make a Nazi unhappy.

828
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,035
- I swear. I swear.
- I swear.

829
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:23,391
- I swear.
- I swear.

830
00:43:23,556 --> 00:43:25,945
- Get out!
- Open the door.

831
00:43:26,116 --> 00:43:27,708
Oh, look! Look, it's Dan.

832
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:29,628
- Hi, Dan!
- Elaine?

833
00:43:30,116 --> 00:43:32,914
- Hi! Dan!
- Come on, let's go. Go.

834
00:43:34,036 --> 00:43:37,187
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien!

835
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:38,584
I repeat, I am not O'Brien!

836
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:41,793
Ask anyone. Jerry! Jerry!

837
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:45,107
So I was watching this movie
the other night, a World War II movie.

838
00:43:45,276 --> 00:43:46,948
And there was Nazis in the movie.

839
00:43:47,116 --> 00:43:49,949
And I noticed that the Nazis
in those movies...

840
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:52,027
...always had, like,
two separate Heils.

841
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,756
They had the regular Heil
that they would do...

842
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:58,113
...and when they were around the
offices, they had this casual Heil.

843
00:43:58,276 --> 00:44:00,028
Remember that?
They'd come in the office:

844
00:44:00,196 --> 00:44:02,107
"Yeah, Heil, how are you? What's...?

845
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:05,348
Is the kid back with coffee? Come on,
are you finished with the copier?

846
00:44:05,516 --> 00:44:07,234
Yeah, world domination, Aryan race.

847
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,864
So whose doughnuts are those?
Yeah, Heil. Nice to see you.

848
00:44:10,036 --> 00:44:11,594
Can I have one
of those doughnuts?"

849
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,227

850
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:04,464
The concept behind the car phone...

851
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:08,101
...speakerphone, airline phone,
portable phone...

852
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:10,307
...pay phone, cordless phone,
multiline phone...

853
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:12,143
...the phone pager, the call waiting...

854
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:16,310
...call forwarding, conferencing, speed
dialling, direct dialling and redialling...

855
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:19,031
...is that we all have
absolutely nothing to say...

856
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:22,149
...and we've got to talk to someone
about it right now.

857
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:25,189
Cannot wait another second.

858
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,183
You're at home, you're on the phone.

859
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:28,545
You're in the car making calls.

860
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:30,349
You get to work,
"Any messages for me?"

861
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:34,823
You gotta give people
a chance to miss you a little!

862
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:42,309
It's bad enough you have a car phone.
You have to use the speak er?

863
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:46,424
It's safer. Plus, it's more annoying
to the other person.

864
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:49,581
- Oh, look at this guy.
- What's going on?

865
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,549
A guy's trying to get in front of me,
has to ask permission. Yes.

866
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,781
Go ahead. Get in, get in.

867
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,430
- Did you get a thank-you wave?
- No, nothing.

868
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,263
How could you not
give a thank-you wave?

869
00:46:00,431 --> 00:46:03,389
Hey, buddy, where's
my thank-you wave?

870
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:05,981
Give me that wave!

871
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:09,590
- Hey, Jerry, are you free on Friday?
- Yeah, I'm free. Why?

872
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:12,948
Oh, God. I bumped into
Robin Sandusky today.

873
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,830
She asked me to have dinner
with her and her husband.

874
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:17,709
Oh, my God.

875
00:46:17,871 --> 00:46:20,943
You won't believe what I saw.
A car just bashed into a parked car...

876
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,863
...and sped off, right on my block.

877
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:26,305
- You've got to follow that car.
- What?

878
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:29,543
- You can't let him get away with that.
- The guy could be dangerous.

879
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:33,586
- What are you, yellow?
- I'm not yellow.

880
00:46:35,111 --> 00:46:37,261
Jerry, if you don't follow him,
you're yellow.

881
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:39,342
- Wait. He stopped. He's parking.
- What?

882
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:41,263
What? I can't hear you. Jerry?

883
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:44,623
Excuse me.

884
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:47,385
I was driving behind you, you know...

885
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,384
...a few blocks back, and l...
I couldn't...

886
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:53,111
...help... Maybe you didn't realize l...

887
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:55,341
l... I witnessed that...

888
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:59,508
...your... Your left rear tire's
a little low.

889
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:03,220
That can affect the performance
of the twin l-beam suspension...

890
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:07,270
...not to mention, you know,
your rack-and-pinion steering.

891
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:14,542
So I wound up going out
for a decaf cappuccino with her.

892
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:17,502
Boy, what a story.

893
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,020
I'm speechless, speechless.
I have no speech.

894
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:26,391
You know, I really liked her.
We talked, we flirted.

895
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:29,668
And when she laughed,
she'd reach out and touch my arm.

896
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:34,825
Love when they touch your arm.
I can't get enough of that.

897
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:36,788
- Me either.
- Why is that?

898
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,506
Let's not even analyse it.

899
00:47:39,871 --> 00:47:42,544
- So you didn't turn her in.
- I couldn't go though with it.

900
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:45,066
- You gonna see her again?
- Friday night.

901
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,019
- Yeah.
- It's me.

902
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:48,624
Come on up.

903
00:47:50,391 --> 00:47:53,349
By the way, Elaine does not
need to know about anything.

904
00:47:53,511 --> 00:47:55,627
Hey, hey, hey.

905
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:57,703
I dig.

906
00:47:59,071 --> 00:48:00,709
- Oh, you dig?
- Yes.

907
00:48:00,871 --> 00:48:03,431
- I see enormous potential here.
- Why?

908
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:07,140
Because great couples always have
a great story about how they met.

909
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:09,620
That's why I've never been in
a long-term relationship.

910
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,190
I never had a good meeting story.

911
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:13,741
I wonder if I'm nuts
for pursuing this woman at all.

912
00:48:13,911 --> 00:48:15,105
I don't think so.

913
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:17,501
Look, she slammed
into a parked car.

914
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:20,868
She took no responsibility for
mutilating the property of a stranger...

915
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,829
...and then she sped off
like a criminal.

916
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:27,431
On the other hand...

917
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:30,025
...should she never be
allowed to date again?

918
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:32,830
Scratch one car and you're
forbidden to have social contact...

919
00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:35,027
...for the rest of your life?

920
00:48:36,151 --> 00:48:38,107
What am I drinking, milk?

921
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:42,067
- Hey.
- Hi.

922
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:43,425
- Sweater.
- Thank you.

923
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:46,151
So? What happened?

924
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:48,427
- With what?
- With the car.

925
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:49,740
What car?

926
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:51,105
The hit-and-run.

927
00:48:51,271 --> 00:48:55,025
Oh, right, right, right.

928
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:56,385
Well...

929
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:58,542
...actually, the guy
went into Queens.

930
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:00,305
Queens?

931
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,144
- You followed him over the bridge?
- Over the bridge.

932
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:05,586
Oh, l... I didn't know you
went into Queens, Jerry.

933
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,062
Yeah, Queens.

934
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:10,222
So? Then what?

935
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:14,543
He gets out of the car. I said,
"Hey, buddy, I saw you hit that car."

936
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,303
So he says to me:

937
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:18,507
"What are you gonna do about it?"

938
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:21,549
So I said to him,
"Whatever's necessary."

939
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:26,946
I am speechless.

940
00:49:27,111 --> 00:49:29,147
I am without speech.

941
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:32,142
Tell her about the shoving.

942
00:49:35,191 --> 00:49:36,829
What?

943
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:39,748
What shoving?

944
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:42,381
- Oh, it was nothing.
- No.

945
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:44,542
Tell her.

946
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:46,704
Come on. Tell me.

947
00:49:46,871 --> 00:49:49,101
Well, he kind of lost his temper...

948
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:51,739
...and he was pushing me
up against the car...

949
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:54,630
...so I went into a karate stance.

950
00:49:57,751 --> 00:50:00,265
- You know karate?
- I know a little.

951
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:03,503
Well, l... This is so amazing to me.

952
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:05,468
Jerry, what did he do?

953
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:07,508
He backed off.

954
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:10,544
He was pretty pathetic, actually.

955
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:13,903
Hey.

956
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:16,742
- Did you tell Kramer?
- No.

957
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:18,629
What, what? Tell me.

958
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:22,467
Jerry saw this guy smash into a car,
and he followed him.

959
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:25,188
Good for you.

960
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:28,150
What kind of a sick lowlife
would do a thing like that?

961
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:31,030
You know, those people,
you know they're mentally disturbed.

962
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:33,022
They should be sent to Australia.

963
00:50:34,711 --> 00:50:36,269
- Australia?
- That's where England...

964
00:50:36,431 --> 00:50:37,910
...used to send their convicts.

965
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:40,631
- But not anymore.
- No.

966
00:50:44,151 --> 00:50:45,664
Hey, Kramer?

967
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:47,549
Kramer.

968
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,984
- What happened to you right here?
- I don't know.

969
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,946
You know, I was watching
Entertainment Tonight...

970
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:57,830
...and suddenly, you know,
I got dizzy...

971
00:50:57,991 --> 00:51:01,506
...and the next thing I know,
I hit my head on the coffee table.

972
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:06,867
- Well, that is... That is strange.
- Yeah, it's...

973
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:11,948
All right. Oh, Jerry, we're still on
for Friday night, right?

974
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,625
Oh, Friday. No, I can't.
I'm sorry. I have a date.

975
00:51:15,631 --> 00:51:19,021
- But last night you said you were free.
- We just met.

976
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:22,069
You know, maybe it was
a reaction to the sardines.

977
00:51:22,551 --> 00:51:24,382
l... I can't go alone.

978
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:25,825
Ask George to go with you.

979
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:29,350
George, come on. I'll pay for you.

980
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:30,705
You'll pay? I'm there.

981
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:35,344
- Why do you need anybody?
- Because...

982
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,708
...I hate being at a table alone
with a married couple...

983
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:42,625
...talking about their married friends
and their married furniture.

984
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:45,863
They're always trying to make me
feel like their life is so much better.

985
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:48,625
You know, I have a very exciting life.

986
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:50,543
It's very exciting.

987
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:54,667
You went out with a bullfighter?

988
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,705
Yeah, yeah.
Well, an ex-bullfighter now.

989
00:51:57,871 --> 00:52:00,465
- Wow.
- What was his name?

990
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:04,067
His name? His name was... Was...

991
00:52:04,231 --> 00:52:06,950
...Eduardo...

992
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:09,420
...Caroccio.

993
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:11,983
Pass the salt, please.

994
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:13,870
Where did you meet him?

995
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,828
Actually, I met him in Switzerland...

996
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:18,027
...and he was fighting...

997
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:21,228
Is that the word they use, "fighting"?
They don't really fight the bull.

998
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:22,665
They avoid fighting the bull.

999
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:27,469
Bread.

1000
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:33,183
Oh, I just love meeting
new people, you know?

1001
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:35,990
That's how you really
do learn about life.

1002
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:43,666
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

1003
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:48,150
I wasn't gonna say anything, but I
saw he wasn't gonna open his mouth.

1004
00:52:50,551 --> 00:52:53,111
You know who's a good actor?
Anthony Quinn.

1005
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:54,943
Oh, Anthony Quinn. Fine actor.

1006
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:57,341
But from what I understand,
not a very good driver.

1007
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:02,063
Hits everything on the road,
but always leaves a note.

1008
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:03,983
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?

1009
00:53:04,151 --> 00:53:05,504
Excellent film. In fact...

1010
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:07,662
...Quinn said he never felt so good...

1011
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:10,220
...as when he left a note
after smacking into a car.

1012
00:53:11,351 --> 00:53:12,830
Come here.

1013
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:14,783
Really, I was only kidding around.

1014
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:16,350
He was only joking, Michael.

1015
00:53:16,511 --> 00:53:19,071
You think you're special
because you say, "God bless you"?

1016
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:23,110
I don't think I'm special. My mother
always said I'm not special.

1017
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:26,387
He was only joking, Michael.

1018
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:28,587
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, right.

1019
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:30,901
- Take his side!
- I'm not taking his side.

1020
00:53:31,071 --> 00:53:35,349
- Well, whose side are you taking?
- Well, I'm not taking your side!

1021
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:47,059
Kirk Douglas. Now, there's
another very bad driver.

1022
00:53:47,231 --> 00:53:48,789
But he's such an unbelievable guy...

1023
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:50,987
...when he hits someone,
he doesn't leave a note.

1024
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:53,540
He sits in his car
and waits for the other person...

1025
00:53:53,711 --> 00:53:56,783
...so he can exchange license,
registration and apologize.

1026
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:05,385
I said, "God bless you."
Was that so wrong?

1027
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,030
The question is...

1028
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:09,421
...did you allow a space...

1029
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:12,264
...for the husband to come in
with his "God bless you"?

1030
00:54:12,431 --> 00:54:15,104
Because as the husband,
he has the right of first refusal.

1031
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:19,665
- Yeah.
- It's me.

1032
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:21,503
- Come on up.
- Yes.

1033
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:23,468
Yes. I definitely waited.

1034
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:24,950
But let me say this.

1035
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:27,147
Once he passes on that option...

1036
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:29,905
...that "God bless you"
is up for grabs.

1037
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:33,586
No argument, unless she's
one of these multiple sneezers...

1038
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:36,060
...and he's holding his
"God bless you" in abeyance...

1039
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,142
...until she completes the series.

1040
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:41,828
I don't think she is
a multiple sneezer...

1041
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:44,869
...because she sneezed again later
and it was also a single.

1042
00:54:45,351 --> 00:54:46,989
What if she's having an off night?

1043
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,822
- Hi.
- Hi.

1044
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,140
Well.

1045
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:55,347
If it isn't Mr. Gesundheit.

1046
00:54:55,511 --> 00:54:57,866
Oh, yeah. Like there's
something wrong...

1047
00:54:58,031 --> 00:54:59,623
...with saying, "God bless you."

1048
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:01,986
I was raised to say, "God bless you."

1049
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:04,070
Shut up.

1050
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:07,585
What does it mean anyway,
"God bless you"?

1051
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:10,345
It's a stupid "stuperstition."

1052
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:12,069
A stupid what?

1053
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:14,540
Whatever.

1054
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:18,420
You wanna make a person feel better,
you shouldn't say, "God bless you."

1055
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:21,742
You should say,
"You're so good-looking."

1056
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:29,186
Yeah. Yeah. That's better
than "God bless you."

1057
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:33,348
Anyway, she left a message on my
machine. She wants you to call her.

1058
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,786
- Who?
- Robin.

1059
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:37,100
Why?

1060
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:40,149
Well, I assume she called to apologize.
That's why she called me.

1061
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:41,426
Entertainment Tonight is on.

1062
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:43,309
- Where's the phone?
- Bedroom.

1063
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:46,349
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater
for me, would you?

1064
00:55:54,191 --> 00:55:56,910
Georgia peach Marla Maples
reportedly threw...

1065
00:55:57,071 --> 00:56:00,507
...yet another stiletto heel at...

1066
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:01,990
What's it like out?

1067
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,869
It's chilly out.

1068
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:07,503
Should I take a sweater?

1069
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,345
Yeah. You could take
a sweater if you want.

1070
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:11,990
A scarf?

1071
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:16,144
No. Hey, shut this off.
Shut it off.

1072
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:21,944
- What's the matter? What's going on?
- What happened?

1073
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:24,181
- What?
- I think I hit my head again.

1074
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:26,990
- What is wrong?
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

1075
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:28,630
Let me ask you something, Kramer.

1076
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:33,626
The last time you hit your head,
was Mary Hart on TV?

1077
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:36,703
- Yeah.
- That is it!

1078
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:38,429
- What?
- That is it!

1079
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:40,900
Mary Hart's voice! Don't you see?

1080
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:43,266
There's something
about Mary Hart's voice...

1081
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:45,103
...that's giving you seizures.

1082
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:47,990
Just like... Just like...
Just like that woman in Albany!

1083
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:49,743
Mary Hart!

1084
00:56:49,911 --> 00:56:52,141
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1085
00:56:52,551 --> 00:56:54,587
Well, she apologized,
and she wanted to know...

1086
00:56:54,751 --> 00:56:57,060
...if we could get together
Wednesday afternoon.

1087
00:56:57,231 --> 00:56:59,825
- Get together?
- Maybe she just wants to talk to me.

1088
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:01,549
Married women don't get together.

1089
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,269
They have affairs.

1090
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:06,025
Oh, my God, an affair.

1091
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:07,745
It's so adult.

1092
00:57:09,831 --> 00:57:14,427
It's like with stockings and martinis
and William Holden and...

1093
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,587
On the other hand, it probably
wouldn't cost me any money.

1094
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,785
Are you actually considering this?

1095
00:57:23,951 --> 00:57:26,624
I can't have an affair with a married
woman. That's despicable!

1096
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:29,823
It's like hitting a car and driving away
without leaving a note.

1097
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,669
Yeah.

1098
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:33,989
Hey, you know who owns that car?

1099
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,221
- What car?
- The one that was hit the other night.

1100
00:57:36,391 --> 00:57:38,859
- Yeah, who?
- That blond across the street.

1101
00:57:39,031 --> 00:57:42,068
The one with the long ponytail,
she wears those blue sweatpants.

1102
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:47,306
The blond with the blue sweatpants.

1103
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:49,185
Yeah, I think I've seen her.

1104
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:52,303
Well, I gotta get going.

1105
00:57:52,471 --> 00:57:55,269
I'm meeting a guy
with grey sweatpants.

1106
00:57:58,231 --> 00:58:01,701
Wait, wait, wait. How do
you know it's not John Tesh?

1107
00:58:03,831 --> 00:58:07,028
- The blond with the blue sweatpants!
- Who is she?

1108
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:10,103
I had a crush on her for a year!
I've been afraid to approach her.

1109
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:12,307
She belongs on one of these
Hallmark cards.

1110
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:15,508
Oh, right! Right!
The blue sweatpants!

1111
00:58:16,471 --> 00:58:19,144
It's too bad you can't say
anything because of Angela.

1112
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:22,465
Yeah.

1113
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,667
Too bad.

1114
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:32,104
Angela.

1115
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:34,703
Lousy thug.

1116
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:38,381
What kind of sick person
does something like that?

1117
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:40,746
The woman belongs in prison!

1118
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:44,904
I mean, I actually owe it to society
to do something about this!

1119
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,346
I can't sit by and allow this to go on!

1120
00:58:47,511 --> 00:58:50,787
- It's a moral issue, is what it is.
- Can't compromise your principles.

1121
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:52,430
- How can I live?
- Can't live.

1122
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:54,866
I'm not religious, but I know
where to draw the line.

1123
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,862
This country needs
more people like you.

1124
00:58:57,031 --> 00:58:59,226
Don't sell yourself short,
saying, "God bless you"...

1125
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:02,667
...to every Tom, Dick and Harry,
at great personal risk.

1126
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:06,866
- I believe strongly in that. You know.
- There should be more people like us.

1127
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:09,989
That's why the world's
in the shape that it's in.

1128
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,062
You're telling me.

1129
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:20,299
I just want you to know
I'm gonna do everything I can...

1130
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:23,065
...to make sure the party responsible
is made responsible...

1131
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:24,744
...or something very close to that.

1132
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:26,943
Well, God bless you.

1133
00:59:27,991 --> 00:59:29,743
Thank you very much.

1134
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:37,820
Oh, my God. I must be crazy.
What have I done?

1135
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,551
- Oh, no. What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1136
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:43,431
I'll tell you what's wrong.
I just committed adultery.

1137
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,226
You didn't commit adultery. I did.

1138
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,830
Oh, yeah.

1139
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:52,790
If I didn't do it with you, I would have
done it with someone else.

1140
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:57,347
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that.
There's a lot of losers out there.

1141
00:59:58,671 --> 01:00:01,231
Maybe even someone who didn't say,
"God bless you."

1142
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:03,109
Well, that's a given.

1143
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:05,910
In three years with Michael,
not one "God bless you."

1144
01:00:07,031 --> 01:00:09,226
Must be hell living in that house.

1145
01:00:10,631 --> 01:00:13,862
- Hi, it's Michael.
- Hi, Michael.

1146
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:17,103
- Is Robin there?
- Robin? No, why?

1147
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:20,141
She said she was gonna be with you.

1148
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:23,189
No, I haven't spoken to her all da...

1149
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:26,384
Yeah, right.

1150
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:28,507
As a... As a matter of fact...

1151
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:32,630
She... She was here and she...
She left a note...

1152
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:37,182
...but l... I wasn't here, but l...
I have the note right here.

1153
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:39,509
If she's not with you, where is she?

1154
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:41,389
Well, l... I don't know.

1155
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:45,021
Is she with your bald friend
from the other night?

1156
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:47,103
No. No.

1157
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:49,705
Come on, Michael.

1158
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:54,110
He's finished. I'm gonna
sew his ass to his face!

1159
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:58,068
I'm gonna twist his neck so hard
his lips will be his eyebrows!

1160
01:00:58,231 --> 01:01:01,587
I'm gonna break his joints
and reattach them!

1161
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:05,743
You're so good-looking.

1162
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:11,185
Now, you listen to me, suck-face!

1163
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:13,308
You tell anybody anything...

1164
01:01:13,471 --> 01:01:16,588
...and I will carve my initials
in your brain tissue.

1165
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:19,140
- Let me rephrase...
- I'll bash your skull in...

1166
01:01:19,311 --> 01:01:22,701
...like a bad cabbage,
and I'll have a party on your head!

1167
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:27,019
- Elaine. This is Angela.
- I'll pluck your body hairs out...

1168
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:29,068
...with my teeth!

1169
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:31,103
Well, I think I get the gist of it.

1170
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,580
So you don't say anything
to anybody...

1171
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,821
...about me hitting that car.

1172
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,629
What car?

1173
01:01:37,951 --> 01:01:39,589
Good.

1174
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:42,868
- I'm glad we understand each other.
- It's not complicated.

1175
01:01:47,191 --> 01:01:49,705
Very nice meeting you.

1176
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:53,743
Come on up.

1177
01:01:55,751 --> 01:01:58,390
Well, well, Mr. Seinfeld...

1178
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:01,384
...that must have been
so frightening...

1179
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,702
...when you confronted
that guy in Queens.

1180
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:07,226
Now, let me just see
if I've got the scenario right.

1181
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,427
- All right, Elaine.
- No, no, no...

1182
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:11,741
...because I'm picturing...
What? What?

1183
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:13,629
French Connection kind of thing.

1184
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:16,624
You know, sort of a Popeye Doyle
chase through the city.

1185
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:19,021
- It was just a couple of blocks.
- Oh, no, no.

1186
01:02:19,191 --> 01:02:21,102
Come on. Don't be so modest.

1187
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:23,902
- Hey.
- Oh.

1188
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:26,507
Did you check your machine?

1189
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:28,582
No. Why? What's happened?

1190
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:31,990
Michael called me today,
and he asked me where Robin was.

1191
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:35,343
- Yeah, okay.
- And I said I hadn't seen her.

1192
01:02:35,511 --> 01:02:38,503
- What?
- No, George, you don't understand.

1193
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,105
She didn't tell me
she was using me as an excuse.

1194
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:44,104
Okay? But then I realized
what was going on...

1195
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:47,069
...and I said that she left a note.

1196
01:02:47,471 --> 01:02:49,382
But he didn't really buy that.

1197
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:51,985
And then... And then
he did mention your name.

1198
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:55,030
He mentioned my name?
What did he say?

1199
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:58,421
He said he was gonna...

1200
01:02:58,591 --> 01:03:02,027
...sew your ass to your face.

1201
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,424
What?

1202
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:07,981
- Why couldn't you think of something?
- I don't know! He caught me off guard!

1203
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,221
You lie! How hard is it to lie!

1204
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:11,904
It's not that hard.

1205
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:15,941
Well, who told you
to sleep with her, George?

1206
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:17,988
Not my fault.
I wasn't gonna do anything...

1207
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:21,587
...until you got her juiced up with your
story about the affair with the matador!

1208
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:25,221
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't said, "God bless you"!

1209
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:28,542
- Don't start.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it, people.

1210
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:30,622
- Matador?
- Oh, God.

1211
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:32,463
What matador?

1212
01:03:32,631 --> 01:03:34,622
She told them she had
an affair with a matador.

1213
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,144
A matador.

1214
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:38,267
Well, well.

1215
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:45,868
Pray tell, what was
the young man's name?

1216
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,626
Eduardo Caroccio.

1217
01:03:53,031 --> 01:03:55,499
Eduardo...

1218
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:58,139
...Caroccio.

1219
01:03:58,551 --> 01:04:02,226
That's good. That's very good.
Kind of just rolls off the tongue.

1220
01:04:02,391 --> 01:04:06,350
Where on the Upper West Side
might a single girl meet a matador?

1221
01:04:06,511 --> 01:04:08,024
- Perhaps, Zabar's.
- No.

1222
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,751
Or Ray's Pizza.

1223
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:16,670
This person told me to tell you
to get an estimate on the damage.

1224
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:20,619
I already got an estimate. It's $875.

1225
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,861
$875?

1226
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:24,783
That's right.

1227
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:27,547
Well, I'll tell you what.

1228
01:04:27,711 --> 01:04:31,670
I'll give you a check, and then
this person can pay me back.

1229
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:34,701
Who do I make it out to?

1230
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,466
Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

1231
01:04:38,631 --> 01:04:42,067
So, what are you doing this weekend?

1232
01:04:42,431 --> 01:04:43,989
You have got some nerve.

1233
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:46,267
You smash up my car,
you don't admit it...

1234
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:47,910
...and now you want to ask me out?

1235
01:04:48,071 --> 01:04:50,869
- I didn't do it!
- Yeah, right.

1236
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:53,869
You are so good-looking.

1237
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:55,510
Thank you.

1238
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:01,389
Jerry, let's go. You ready?

1239
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:04,111
You really want to do this?
I'm on the road for three weeks.

1240
01:05:04,271 --> 01:05:07,263
Excuse me, I've got a maniac
stalking me. I'm not staying in the city.

1241
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,944
- All right.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

1242
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:14,590
How could you?

1243
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,390
- What?
- I never thought you were capable.

1244
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:19,746
- What did I do?
- I talked to Becky Gelke outside.

1245
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:21,185
She told me you hit and ran.

1246
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,626
I don't even want to
look at you anymore!

1247
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:28,147
All these years of friendship, and
you're... You're nothing but a felon!

1248
01:05:28,311 --> 01:05:30,381
You're an embarrassment
to the building.

1249
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:34,544
I didn't do it. I just had to pay her
to cover for somebody else.

1250
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:37,630
- You're not gonna lie to me, are you?
- No. Never.

1251
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,305
All right. I'm glad we got that
straightened out...

1252
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:42,382
...because I got a date with her.

1253
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,827
You got a date with Becky Gelke?

1254
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:49,579
- I'm going out with her Saturday.
- Can we get out of here?

1255
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:52,948
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
had an excuse to talk to her.

1256
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:56,820
Well, I'm happy to help
in any way that I can.

1257
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:08,981
Liz Taylor...

1258
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:18,024
A man is paralysed, mentally,
by a beautiful woman.

1259
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:19,943
Advertisers really
take advantage of this.

1260
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:22,671
Don't you love ads where
you see the woman in the bikini...

1261
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:25,391
...next to the 32-piece ratchet set,
you know, and she's...?

1262
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:27,303
We'll be looking at the girl...

1263
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:31,942
...looking at the ratchet set going, "All
right, if she's next to the ratchet set...

1264
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:35,986
...and I had that ratchet set...

1265
01:06:36,151 --> 01:06:39,382
...I wonder if that
would mean that...

1266
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,350
I better just buy that ratchet set."

1267

1268
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,803
Do you think...

1269
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,400
...that the security guards
in art museums...

1270
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,642
...really ever stop anybody
from taking the paintings?

1271
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,522
I mean, are they going, " Hey, where
do you think you're going with that?

1272
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:50,602
Come over here.
Give me that Czanne."

1273
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,523
I mean, look at the job
that this man is hired to do.

1274
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,999
He's getting $5 an hour to protect...

1275
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:59,799
...millions of dollars
of priceless art, with what?

1276
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:02,689
He's got a light mocha
brown uniform...

1277
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:05,603
...and a USA Today.
This is what he's got.

1278
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:09,644
Crooks must look at this guy and go,
"We get past the folding chair...

1279
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,199
...and the thermos of coffee,
we can get a Rembrandt."

1280
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:25,207
Kramer, would you hold still?
I can't do this if you keep moving.

1281
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:28,602
You sure you don't want me
to take my clothes off?

1282
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,364
Because I'll do it.

1283
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:34,050
No, that's the last thing
in the world I want you to do.

1284
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,761
Well, why don't you take
your clothes off?

1285
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:40,046
I don't know, I don't think
Jerry would like that.

1286
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:42,121
Well, it'll be our little secret.

1287
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:47,483
God!

1288
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,129
Button fly!

1289
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,520
Why do they put buttons on a fly?

1290
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:57,284
It takes 10 minutes
to get these things open.

1291
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,807
I like the button fly.

1292
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,200
- What?
- That is one place on my wardrobe...

1293
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:05,567
...I do not need sharp,
interlocking metal teeth.

1294
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:08,279
It's like a mink trap down there.

1295
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,841
I'm gonna develop kidney problems.

1296
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,408
- What are you doing today?
- Nothing.

1297
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,880
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come
up to her loft, check out her paintings?

1298
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:19,803
- I don't get art.
- There's nothing to get.

1299
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:21,562
It always has to be explained to me...

1300
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:24,449
...and then I have to have someone
explain the explanation.

1301
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,959
She does abstract stuff. In fact,
she's painting Kramer right now.

1302
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,122
- What for?
- She sees something in him.

1303
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:34,850
So do I, but I wouldn't
hang it on a wall.

1304
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,283
Are you getting the eyes?

1305
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:40,044
Because they're brown.

1306
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:44,044
Really, they're dark brown,
like rich Colombian coffee.

1307
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:47,963
Tell me about Elaine.

1308
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,366
You know, she and Jerry
were a big thing...

1309
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,407
...like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

1310
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:57,167
- But they're still friends.
- Yeah, yeah. They're like this:

1311
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:01,481
- Don't you think that's strange?
- Why? What's the difference?

1312
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:05,410
Are you still friends with any
of your ex-girlfriends?

1313
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:08,124
Well, you know, I...

1314
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:10,485
I have many relationships.

1315
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:15,125
- I tell you, I'm a little nervous.
- Why?

1316
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,168
You know, the friend meeting
the new woman.

1317
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:21,242
I feel like I'm getting fixed up
for a friendship.

1318
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,807
I don't know how long
this is gonna last.

1319
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,200
Really?
I thought you liked her.

1320
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,321
I do, but she's got,
like, a jealousy thing.

1321
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,845
She doesn't like me having
fun with anyone but her.

1322
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:33,445
You know, it's a miracle
you're not married.

1323
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,444
Hey, I'm not obligated
to buy anything, am I?

1324
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,761
- Hi, Nina.
- Hi.

1325
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:45,409
- This is my friend George.
- Hello.

1326
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,481
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

1327
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:49,368
Hey, look at this guy!

1328
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,880
I brought George up to see
some of your paintings.

1329
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,881
Oh, are you interested?

1330
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:00,922
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I'm interested.

1331
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,365
George, you gonna buy a painting?

1332
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,562
Yeah, sure.

1333
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,723
- Are you an art lover?
- I am an art adorer. I adore art.

1334
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,726
Great. Take a look around.
Pick something out you like.

1335
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,089
May I?

1336
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,001
Get out of here.

1337
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:21,924
Here. Play with this.

1338
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,445
- What's this?
- My father gave me four tickets...

1339
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:26,965
...to the Yankee game
for Saturday afternoon.

1340
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,849
Owner's box, first row,
behind the dugout.

1341
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:32,770
Saturday! I'm working.
I'm going out of town.

1342
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,846
Well, I won't go without you.
You guys want them?

1343
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,443
Yeah.

1344
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:40,170
They're right behind the dugout,
George. First row.

1345
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:43,049
Behind the dugout? Are you kid...?
How did you get them?

1346
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:46,520
My father's the Yankees' accountant.
It's the owner's box.

1347
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:50,365
All my life I've dreamed of sitting
front row, behind the dugout.

1348
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:53,446
You like that one?

1349
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,438
Look at where we are!

1350
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,920
He's not stopping. He keeps
going and going and going.

1351
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,164
We're not in the first row?

1352
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:08,164
- No, no. These are your seats.
- She said first row behind the dugout.

1353
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,002
It's the second row. It's just as good.

1354
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:13,367
I was primed for the first row. I was
gonna put my feet on the dugout.

1355
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:16,647
Shut up. These are great.
You can't get any better than this.

1356
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,846
There's better. Right there.
That's better.

1357
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,204
All right.

1358
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:21,889
Oh, boy.

1359
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,610
- All right. Who wants a dog?
- Yeah. Here you go.

1360
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,398
What a great day.

1361
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:29,130
I could've been at my boss'
son's bris right now.

1362
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:30,889
That what you were
supposed to do?

1363
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,244
Yeah.

1364
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:35,208
What makes him think anyone wants
to witness a circumcision?

1365
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,326
I'd rather go to a hanging.

1366
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:40,209
Is it that unattractive
to have to take it off?

1367
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:42,409
Have you ever seen one with it?

1368
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:43,844
No.

1369
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:46,560
You wouldn't even
know what it was.

1370
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,603
Anyway, I called him back.

1371
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:55,400
I told him I had to visit my father
in the hospital in Maryland.

1372
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,846
You better catch it here, Charlie,
because this ain't Philadelphia!

1373
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,568
- George?
- Yeah?

1374
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:03,563
Hi. I'm Leonard West.

1375
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:06,802
- Nina's father.
- Hi, hi, Mr. West. I'm sorry.

1376
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,369
- This is my friend Elaine.
- Hi.

1377
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:12,682
Hey, .230 ain't gonna
cut it in this town, babe!

1378
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,408
This is Kramer.

1379
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:16,128
Hey, how you doing?

1380
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,723
Yes! Yes!

1381
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,008
- How are the seats?
- Okay.

1382
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:26,001
- Great. They're great.
- I hear you bought...

1383
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,445
...one of Nina's paintings.
- It's being framed now.

1384
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:30,009
I don't even know what it costs.

1385
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,002
Not too expensive, is it?

1386
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:33,888
Not if you have a lot of money.

1387
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:37,244
It was cheaper for me
when she was an actress.

1388
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,484
Well...

1389
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:45,167
- Enjoy the game.
- Thanks.

1390
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,605
I think you better take
off the Orioles cap.

1391
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:49,089
Yeah. I better.

1392
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,161
No, no. Seriously.
You're in the owner's box.

1393
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,286
I don't think it's a good idea.

1394
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:56,362
- You're not serious.
- Yes, yes, yes, I am.

1395
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:59,839
- Did he say that?
- No, but he gave me the seats.

1396
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,319
I don't think he'd like you
wearing an Orioles cap.

1397
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,446
- Maybe you should ask him.
- I don't have to.

1398
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,362
Are you gonna take
the hat off or not?

1399
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:07,758
No. I'm not gonna
take it off.

1400
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,409
Why should I?
That's ridiculous.

1401
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,128
Just take the cap off.

1402
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:13,850
George, I am at a baseball game.

1403
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,602
- This is America.
- Look!

1404
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:18,079
Either you take the cap off
or you leave.

1405
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,524
I'm not taking it off.

1406
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:22,079
- Elaine, just take the cap off.
- No! Get off of my hat!

1407
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,888
- What's...?
- What do you mean?!

1408
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:25,608
- Stop it!
- Just take it off!

1409
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:29,043
- There's your cap!
- Let's go.

1410
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:32,247
Oh, my God. All right,
get your hands off of me!

1411
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,447
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a minute. We just got here.

1412
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:37,043
Do you want us to go with you?

1413
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,442
- No, you stay.
- Get your cap, George.

1414
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,601
- Well, I was just thinking...
- Yeah. Stay!

1415
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,840
All right, all right, we'll go, we'll go.

1416
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:55,319
And then the ball hits him in the head,
and he falls right over the railing.

1417
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:58,323
- Is he okay?
- Well, yeah, he's fine.

1418
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:01,721
We took him to the emergency room.
The x-rays were all negative.

1419
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,439
It was quite a day.

1420
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,646
This is the most amazing story
I've ever heard.

1421
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,846
Why did he want you to take
off the baseball cap?

1422
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,409
- That is so insane.
- I know.

1423
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,640
Can you imagine that?

1424
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:19,439
- How you feeling?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1425
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,282
Hi, Carol.

1426
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:23,681
Hey, look. We made the paper.

1427
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,762
Look at this. Page two, sports section.
We're all in the picture.

1428
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:30,329
- Picture?
- Picture.

1429
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,799
- Our picture's in there? What?
- Yeah.

1430
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:35,246
I cannot believe this.

1431
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,480
- There's George.
- Look at him.

1432
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,527
Oh, my God!
Lippman could see this!

1433
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:42,045
He thinks I was visiting my father.
Oh, my God!

1434
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:46,726
I make up one little white lie,
and they put my picture in the paper!

1435
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,243
Hi, Mr. Lippman.

1436
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,008
How's your father?

1437
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:56,962
My... My father.

1438
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:59,439
Yeah. You went to see him, right?

1439
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:01,202
Yeah.

1440
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:03,725
- I went to visit him.
- So...

1441
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:07,883
...what was wrong with him?
- Well, you name it. You know...

1442
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:12,601
Neuritis, neuralgia.

1443
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,204
But he's feeling better now, right?

1444
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,247
Yes. Yeah. It's such a miracle.

1445
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:21,129
You know, my visit must have
buoyed his spirits.

1446
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:23,364
Buoyed.

1447
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,402
- What did I say?
- You said "boy'd."

1448
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:28,966
- I did?
- Yeah.

1449
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:40,964
Well, I got a plane to catch.

1450
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:43,485
- Where are you going?
- Going to Houston for a few days.

1451
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:45,288
Publishers' convention.

1452
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:47,049
Can I have my sports section?

1453
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,442
- Oh, yeah.
- Sports section.

1454
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:54,522
I'm saving it for the plane. I never
miss the Sunday sports section.

1455
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:56,965
There's nothing to read.
It's yesterday's news.

1456
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:59,928
The Yankees won, the Mets lost,
Rickey Henderson's unhappy.

1457
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,603
Right. Right.

1458
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,000
What are you doing?

1459
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:08,680
That is the third time today
I have done that.

1460
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:13,919
I keep, you know, grabbing
newspapers and just tugging at them.

1461
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,682
Well, I gotta go.

1462
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:19,047
Okay. Yes, well, you know,
have a nice trip.

1463
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:23,807
Alrighty. I'll just
hold down the fort.

1464
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:31,402
I sense great vulnerability...

1465
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:33,606
...a man-child crying out for love...

1466
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:37,763
...an innocent orphan
in the postmodern world.

1467
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,000
I see a parasite.

1468
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,998
A sexually depraved miscreant...

1469
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:49,528
...who is seeking only to gratify his
basest and most immediate urges.

1470
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,129
She was a guest of my father's.

1471
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:55,645
- She should've taken the cap off.
- It's preposterous...

1472
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:58,768
...to ask someone to take off a
baseball cap at a baseball game.

1473
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:00,158
How can you defend that?

1474
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:03,003
His struggle is man's struggle.

1475
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:05,286
He lifts my spirit.

1476
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,408
He is a loathsome, offensive brute.

1477
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,160
Yet I can't look away.

1478
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:15,088
Look, I'm tired of all this fighting.

1479
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:18,526
Maybe we should end this before
we really start hating each other.

1480
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:22,319
You wouldn't want that, because you
always have to remain friends.

1481
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,766
I like to remain friends
with people I was friends with.

1482
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:29,324
Hey, why don't you just go then?

1483
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:33,449
And give this to George.
Tell him he owes me $500.

1484
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:38,166
He transcends time and space.

1485
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,439
He sickens me.

1486
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,609
I love it.

1487
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,000
Me too.

1488
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:52,881
Five hundred dollars?

1489
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:55,525
- What?
- That's what she told me.

1490
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:58,240
I'm not paying $500 for this!

1491
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,809
It's a piece of junk!

1492
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:02,361
- That's what it costs.
- Why did you take it?

1493
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:05,602
- You broke up with her.
- I wasn't thinking. I don't know.

1494
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:08,045
You weren't thinking.

1495
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:12,008
I mean, she framed it
and everything.

1496
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,001
I'm not buying this.
No way. Forget it.

1497
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:15,523
No way I'm buying this.

1498
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,920
I mean, look at it! What is it?

1499
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,644
It's a bunch of squiggly lines.

1500
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,562
Are you telling me you
couldn't paint this?

1501
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:26,166
You want me to paint you something?
I'd love to paint you something.

1502
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:28,118
I'm not paying for this.

1503
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:31,043
If you were going out with her,
it'd be a different story.

1504
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,082
This was in front of your door.

1505
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,683
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hi, Mike.

1506
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,643
Wow, a letter from Nina!

1507
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,205
Man, that is the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

1508
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:48,641
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1509
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:51,040
This is amazing.
You can't believe this.

1510
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:54,202
Listen to this. " I don't know what
you expect to find, Jerry.

1511
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:57,601
You know what you want better than
me, but there's one thing I do know.

1512
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:59,840
I can stand here watching
you try to destroy...

1513
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:02,001
...everything I've ever
wanted in my life...

1514
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:06,243
...wanting to smash your face with my
fists because you won't even make...

1515
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:09,720
...the slightest effort to opt for
happiness and still know I love you.

1516
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:12,324
You mean so much to me,
I'm willing to take your abuse...

1517
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:13,843
...insults and insensitivity."

1518
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,319
- Wow.
- She's deep.

1519
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:20,607
"Because that's what you need to
do to prove I'm not gonna leave you.

1520
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:23,807
I'm sick and tired of running from
places and people and relationships.

1521
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,359
You want me,
then fight for me, beca...

1522
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,879
Because I'm sure as hell
fighting for you.

1523
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,443
I think we're both worth it."

1524
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:44,647
You know, Jerry,
she sounds like a poet.

1525
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,244
Boy, no one's ever written me
a letter like this.

1526
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,207
Maybe I was wrong about her.

1527
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:52,168
Get in there and give her a call.
Pick up the phone and call her.

1528
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:55,527
- Should I?
- Yes, you're damn right you should!

1529
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:58,244
Fight for her, Jerry!
She's sure the hell fighting for you!

1530
01:20:58,410 --> 01:20:59,729
All right!

1531
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:02,886
I'll call her.

1532
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,685
Don't go in there.
You're gonna get shot.

1533
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:22,321
I told you.

1534
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,363
- Yeah.
- It's George.

1535
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:28,009
Come on up.

1536
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:32,481
Well, now we gotta get
a posse together.

1537
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,443
I love a good posse.

1538
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,528
What's the appeal of the posse?

1539
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,009
The appeal of the posse?

1540
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,047
Posse has tremendous appeal.

1541
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:44,839
Get away from the job, you camp out,
you're with friends.

1542
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:50,120
Come on, it's a week-long game of
hide and go seek on horseback.

1543
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:53,398
Hello, George.

1544
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,367
Hey. Hey, Nina.

1545
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,207
I owe you some money, don't I?

1546
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:05,808
- Well, I really love that piece.
- Me too. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

1547
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:09,121
You know, in fact, I've been
thinking about it, and...

1548
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,679
...you know, I feel like
I'm stealing from you.

1549
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:15,206
Five hundred dollars! This is
gonna be worth thousands soon.

1550
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:18,487
You know what? On second thought,
I can't even accept this.

1551
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:22,438
No, no, no. George, a deal's a deal.
I want you to have it.

1552
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,678
This could be in a museum someday.
It's not safe with me.

1553
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:28,603
It should really be
in a doorman building.

1554
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:31,204
Honestly, George,
the money's not important.

1555
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,042
Who said anything about money?

1556
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:36,404
- Yeah.
- It's Elaine.

1557
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:37,764
Come on up.

1558
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:39,443
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

1559
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,400
She does not believe in telephones,
does she?

1560
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:46,119
She likes the pop-in.
I've told her how I hate the pop-in.

1561
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:47,769
He likes the pop-in too.

1562
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,364
Just popped in now.
I'm a big pop-in guy.

1563
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:52,441
- He is.
- What about Kramer?

1564
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,840
Huge pop-in guy.

1565
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:59,203
Well, I was leaving anyway.
So we're on for tomorrow?

1566
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:01,679
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

1567
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,042
Hello.

1568
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:08,521
Chatty gal.

1569
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,325
Lippman's coming back tomorrow.
I'll be fired.

1570
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,401
If he noticed it,
he would have called you.

1571
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:16,959
No. He wants to torture me.

1572
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:19,283
Will you give me the clicker?

1573
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,918
I hate it when you have the clicker.
You're too fast.

1574
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:25,002
Get out!
I'm a great clicker.

1575
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:27,163
I have great instincts.

1576
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:29,400
How dare you impugn my clicking.

1577
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:32,079
You're all over the dial.
You don't know what you want.

1578
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,481
You never stay on anything longer
than five seconds. Just give me that.

1579
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,481
- Let go.
- Come on. I want it, Jerry!

1580
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:39,481
- Let go, Elaine!
- Then let George do it!

1581
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:41,368
- George can't click!
- Give it to me!

1582
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,441
Give it! Give it! Give it!

1583
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,282
Pinheads.

1584
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,762
Maybe I can't...

1585
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:52,119
...analyse and theorize and...

1586
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:54,724
...speculate on why we...

1587
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:56,926
Wait a second. Go back to that.
Go back to that.

1588
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:59,041
Hey, you read all those books,
not me.

1589
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,802
It's Chapter Two.
It's Neil Simon.

1590
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:03,086
But one thing I do know.

1591
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,047
I know how I feel.

1592
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:08,001
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

1593
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:11,048
- What?
- My God. The letter. That's the letter!

1594
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,685
- What letter?
- This is the letter she wrote to me.

1595
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,806
She stole it from the movie!

1596
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:17,289
Because you don't even mak e...

1597
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:20,169
"The slightest effort
to opt for happiness...

1598
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:23,720
...and still know that I love you!"

1599
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,000
This is incredible.

1600
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:29,765
I always thought there was something
funny about this letter.

1601
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,682
She's copied it right out of
Chapter Two.

1602
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,761
She's a thief! A bunco artist.

1603
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,239
Maybe I won't send her that check.

1604
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:42,250
You know, it's not really that terrible.

1605
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,720
What are you talking about? She
completely misrepresented herself.

1606
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,802
I don't opt for happiness.
I opt for happiness.

1607
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:51,643
James Caan doesn't
opt for happiness.

1608
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:55,844
Yeah. Yeah.

1609
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,927
She wouldn't take the cap off?

1610
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:02,722
No. But didn't she know they
were the owner's seats?

1611
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,450
Oh, that's unbelievable.

1612
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:08,204
Yeah, okay. All right, Lenny.

1613
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:09,723
Thanks again.

1614
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:11,608
Take care.

1615
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:16,324
That's Lenny West, my accountant,
who's a hell of a guy.

1616
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,879
He handles the Yankees too.
It's his biggest account.

1617
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:23,284
So every once in a while,
they throw him a couple of seats...

1618
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:26,726
...and last weekend,
he gave them to his daughter.

1619
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:29,769
She's an artist, by the way.
Anyway...

1620
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:32,603
...her daughter gives them
to some friends, you know?

1621
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:35,000
One of her friends shows up...

1622
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,240
...wearing a Baltimore cap.

1623
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,641
You're from Baltimore, right?

1624
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,799
It's Towson.
That's near Baltimore.

1625
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,722
But you're an Oriole fan, right?

1626
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:49,279
Well, fan...
You know, my father...

1627
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:52,442
Anyway, she refused
to take the cap off.

1628
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:54,089
She caused a whole big scene.

1629
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:56,321
Really? That's so impudent.

1630
01:25:56,490 --> 01:26:00,005
Yeah. So Lenny gave me
the tickets for tomorrow night.

1631
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:03,207
I'm inviting Frank and Marsha.
Want you to come.

1632
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:09,442
I've got plans, though, Mr. Lippman.

1633
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:11,043
Well, break them.

1634
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:13,720
You missed the bris.
I want you at the game.

1635
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:18,080
Okay. Okay.

1636
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,639
- Good.
- Okay, Mr. Lippman.

1637
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:26,480
And, Elaine, you know the Baltimore
cap you got in your office...

1638
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:29,210
...wear it. I'm gonna have
a little fun with him.

1639
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:33,686
That will be fun.

1640
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:38,364
How's it coming?

1641
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:40,482
Good. Good.

1642
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:44,321
Seen any good movies lately?

1643
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,603
No. Not really.

1644
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,125
- You?
- No.

1645
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:52,406
I like a good comedy.

1646
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:55,130
You know, like a Neil Simon.

1647
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:58,168
- You like Neil Simon?
- Neil Simon?

1648
01:26:58,490 --> 01:26:59,889
Some of his stuff.

1649
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,881
I've seen most of it.

1650
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,883
I guess my favourite
would have to be...

1651
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,961
...Chapter Two.

1652
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,929
Have you ever seen that?

1653
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,761
I don't know. Maybe.

1654
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,478
I have.

1655
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:18,559
Funny. Funny.

1656
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:20,721
In fact, it was on TV
just the other night.

1657
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,562
Happened to catch it.

1658
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:25,961
I couldn't help but notice...

1659
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:28,325
...a stunning similarity...

1660
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,287
Well, we've made our decision.

1661
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,122
We want the Kramer.

1662
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:38,958
Five thousand? Why would anybody
buy Kramer for $5000?

1663
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,969
Boy, the Yankees cannot
buy a hit tonight.

1664
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:48,325
So is it all over between you
and Marsha Mason?

1665
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,644
Yeah.

1666
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,768
And by the way, can you get
this thing out of my house?

1667
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,409
I'll make a deal with you.

1668
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:58,403
- I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks.
- Please.

1669
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:03,644
Seems to be a lot of trouble in the
area just behind the Yank ee dugout.

1670
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:06,809
Behind the dugout? That's where
we were sitting the other night.

1671
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:10,121
We're not gonna show it, don't want
to encourage that kind of behaviour.

1672
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:13,919
It's a young lady, and she's really
going at it with the security guard.

1673
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:17,685
She's a feisty one. They're getting the
other security guard to come down.

1674
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,078
How do you lik e that, Seaver?

1675
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:21,684
And, boy, she's something,
and a Baltimore fan at that.

1676
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:23,920
Holy cow!

1677
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:32,646
When I was 17, I ran away from home
and hopped a steamship to Sweden.

1678
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:37,009
- This steak is excellent, by the way.
- More potatoes?

1679
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:38,603
Yeah, yeah, sure. Please.

1680
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:42,888
Yes, yes, go on. You hopped
a steamship to Sweden?

1681
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:47,048
It was a big one.

1682
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:49,883
Baseball season's starting.
I'm very excited about that.

1683
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:52,803
Did you ever sneak down
to better seats at the game...

1684
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,688
...and get caught by the usher?

1685
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:58,001
When you're a kid, you're getting
chased from every place anyway.

1686
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,479
When you're an adult,
it's really embarrassing.

1687
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:03,562
You have to pretend like there's
some confusion.

1688
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:07,128
You put on this whole act.
You're looking at the tickets.

1689
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:10,248
"I don't understand how this
could have happened.

1690
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,241
Let me see. I see the problem.

1691
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:15,368
These are very good seats.
I have very bad seats.

1692
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:17,998
That's the misunderstanding."

1693
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:03,681

1694
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:08,666
I bought the Ginsu knife.

1695
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,233
I did buy the Ginsu knife.

1696
01:30:12,397 --> 01:30:15,673
I know, you can't believe it,
but I did, I swear. I saw it.

1697
01:30:15,837 --> 01:30:17,236
It was late, I'm watching...

1698
01:30:17,397 --> 01:30:20,514
...and it started making sense to me.
I'm thinking:

1699
01:30:20,677 --> 01:30:23,589
"Yeah, cut through the shoe,
cut through the can, yeah.

1700
01:30:23,757 --> 01:30:24,951
Yeah, I want that."

1701
01:30:25,117 --> 01:30:27,677
So I called up the number
on the screen, you know...

1702
01:30:27,837 --> 01:30:30,874
...and I said, " I'd like to order
the Ginsu knife."

1703
01:30:31,037 --> 01:30:33,392
And the lady went, "Really?"

1704
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:35,794
I mean, even the Ginsu people
have given up.

1705
01:30:35,957 --> 01:30:37,675
It's really so sad, you know.

1706
01:30:37,837 --> 01:30:41,591
I guess, to be honest, if you need
a knife that can cut through a shoe...

1707
01:30:41,757 --> 01:30:46,148
...perhaps you're not buying the
highest grade of meat available.

1708
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:50,595
Maybe you ought to think about not
getting the "hoof cut" once in a while.

1709
01:30:56,637 --> 01:30:58,946
What is it about sleep
that mak es you so thirsty?

1710
01:30:59,117 --> 01:31:01,073
Do dreams require liquid?

1711
01:31:01,237 --> 01:31:04,513
It's not lik e I'm running a marathon,
I'm just lying there.

1712
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,669
What the hell?
Why is the door open?

1713
01:31:10,877 --> 01:31:13,914
- Kramer, what are you doing here?!
- Jerry, now calm down. It's okay.

1714
01:31:14,077 --> 01:31:15,749
- Oh, God.
- I'm sorry.

1715
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:17,669
I didn't want to wake you up.

1716
01:31:17,837 --> 01:31:19,793
I was watching
Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo...

1717
01:31:19,957 --> 01:31:23,029
...and l... You know, I wanted
to get some popcorn...

1718
01:31:23,197 --> 01:31:25,153
...so I used the spare keys
that you gave me...

1719
01:31:25,317 --> 01:31:27,308
...to come in to get your popper.

1720
01:31:27,477 --> 01:31:29,672
- You scared me!
- It's just me.

1721
01:31:29,837 --> 01:31:33,512
- That's enough!
- Yeah, okay. Forgot the popper.

1722
01:31:38,877 --> 01:31:40,993
It's not broken.

1723
01:31:44,717 --> 01:31:47,436
Come on.

1724
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:55,430
Kramer!

1725
01:31:55,597 --> 01:31:56,871
What are you doing?

1726
01:31:57,037 --> 01:31:58,311
What does it look like? What?

1727
01:31:58,477 --> 01:32:00,593
Get out of the bathroom. I gotta go!

1728
01:32:00,757 --> 01:32:02,634
All right, all right.

1729
01:32:03,077 --> 01:32:05,545
- Come on!
- All right.

1730
01:32:06,077 --> 01:32:10,036
- Move it, move it! Get going!
- Well, my drain's all clogged up.

1731
01:32:10,557 --> 01:32:14,232
- Is that my towel?
- Yes.

1732
01:32:16,677 --> 01:32:19,475
I'm really happy the movie
was sold out.

1733
01:32:19,637 --> 01:32:21,673
You ever pretend there's
murderers chasing you...

1734
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:24,271
...and see how fast you can
get into your apartment?

1735
01:32:24,437 --> 01:32:26,997
I'm from Wichita.

1736
01:32:28,197 --> 01:32:30,392
- There he is!
- Hurry, Jerry, he's coming.

1737
01:32:30,557 --> 01:32:33,708
- He's coming. The murderers!
- Hurry. Hurry, he's coming. Hurry!

1738
01:32:33,877 --> 01:32:35,788
Oh, Jerry.

1739
01:32:37,437 --> 01:32:39,393
Boy, that was close.

1740
01:32:39,557 --> 01:32:42,025
Did you see the look
on that guy's face?

1741
01:32:42,197 --> 01:32:47,669
- You were so fast with those keys.
- Well...

1742
01:32:52,797 --> 01:32:53,991
- Beautiful.
- Kramer!

1743
01:32:54,157 --> 01:32:55,556
What the hell are you doing here?

1744
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:58,789
Hey, Jerry, how are you? I thought
you were going to the movies.

1745
01:32:58,957 --> 01:33:00,151
That's it, hand them over.

1746
01:33:00,317 --> 01:33:01,636
- What?
- You know what. The keys.

1747
01:33:01,797 --> 01:33:03,196
You've lost your key privileges.

1748
01:33:03,357 --> 01:33:04,585
- Oh, come on.
- No "come on."

1749
01:33:04,757 --> 01:33:06,987
- I thought you went to the movie.
- It was sold out.

1750
01:33:07,157 --> 01:33:08,875
How was I to know
it would be sold out?

1751
01:33:09,037 --> 01:33:10,550
- That's the point.
- What point?

1752
01:33:10,717 --> 01:33:12,992
- Just give me the keys.
- Just give me another chance.

1753
01:33:13,157 --> 01:33:14,476
- Don't ask me.
- I'm asking you.

1754
01:33:14,637 --> 01:33:15,990
- I'm telling you.
- You're joking.

1755
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:17,715
- I'm serious.
- It won't happen again.

1756
01:33:17,877 --> 01:33:19,515
- It will. Give me the keys.
- No.

1757
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,269
- Let go.
- You let go. Come on, Jerry.

1758
01:33:21,437 --> 01:33:24,110
Now, stop it. Come on, Kramer.

1759
01:33:25,957 --> 01:33:27,436
Oh, great! Okay, all right.

1760
01:33:27,597 --> 01:33:29,349
Fine, you go ahead. Take the keys.

1761
01:33:29,517 --> 01:33:31,155
But you're gonna regret this.

1762
01:33:31,317 --> 01:33:33,308
All right, yeah.

1763
01:33:37,877 --> 01:33:39,196
Goochie.

1764
01:33:40,797 --> 01:33:43,072
- So put them in a safe place.
- I will.

1765
01:33:43,237 --> 01:33:44,955
- Where?
- I don't know.

1766
01:33:45,117 --> 01:33:46,391
I'll hide them.

1767
01:33:46,557 --> 01:33:48,468
- So is Kramer upset?
- I think so.

1768
01:33:48,637 --> 01:33:51,026
I mean, he's acting really weird lately.
He's different.

1769
01:33:51,597 --> 01:33:53,906
- Just give him the keys back.
- No, I can't.

1770
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:57,713
Is that Kramer?

1771
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:01,151
- Who's there?
- Kramer.

1772
01:34:02,157 --> 01:34:05,832
Hey. Oh, hi. Oh, you got the...

1773
01:34:08,037 --> 01:34:10,949
- No, I am not...
- No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

1774
01:34:11,117 --> 01:34:13,585
I don't care about the keys.
It's my fault.

1775
01:34:13,757 --> 01:34:16,146
No, I gave the keys away
with my stupidity.

1776
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,706
I broke the covenant of the keys.

1777
01:34:20,797 --> 01:34:23,186
- Jerry, give him the keys back.
- Elaine.

1778
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:24,870
- Here.
- What are you doing?

1779
01:34:25,037 --> 01:34:26,948
- I'm giving him the keys.
- Those are my keys.

1780
01:34:27,117 --> 01:34:29,677
- Let go! Jerry! No!
- Elaine. Come on.

1781
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:32,510
Stop it! Stop it!
I don't want the keys back.

1782
01:34:32,677 --> 01:34:34,713
No, I'm glad the way
things turned out.

1783
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:36,708
I was clinging to those keys, man...

1784
01:34:36,877 --> 01:34:39,675
...like a branch on the banks
of a raging river...

1785
01:34:39,837 --> 01:34:41,270
...and now I have let go.

1786
01:34:41,637 --> 01:34:44,549
And I'm free to go with the current...

1787
01:34:44,717 --> 01:34:46,389
...to float.

1788
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:47,910
- And I thank you.
- Take the keys.

1789
01:34:48,077 --> 01:34:50,113
- I don't want them.
- I want you to have them.

1790
01:34:50,277 --> 01:34:52,666
- I don't want them! I can't.
- Come on. Take them!

1791
01:34:52,837 --> 01:34:55,510
- No!
- Okay.

1792
01:34:55,677 --> 01:34:57,156
Now, one more thing.

1793
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:58,955
I would like my keys back.

1794
01:34:59,237 --> 01:35:01,751
- Your spare set?
- Yeah, that's right.

1795
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:03,828
- You want them back?
- Yeah, yeah...

1796
01:35:03,997 --> 01:35:05,510
...I think it would be for the best.

1797
01:35:21,597 --> 01:35:23,030
Gee, Kramer, I...

1798
01:35:23,197 --> 01:35:24,391
I don't know what to say.

1799
01:35:26,317 --> 01:35:28,114
Say yes.

1800
01:35:28,277 --> 01:35:30,472
Yes, George, yes.

1801
01:35:30,957 --> 01:35:33,107
- Yes?
- Yes.

1802
01:35:33,277 --> 01:35:37,828
Should I give you my keys?
Is that the transaction, trading keys?

1803
01:35:37,997 --> 01:35:40,386
- Because Elaine has my keys.
- You can get them back.

1804
01:35:41,157 --> 01:35:42,476
I suppose I could.

1805
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:46,388
Because you see, George,
having the keys to Jerry's apartment...

1806
01:35:46,557 --> 01:35:49,947
...that kept me in a fantasy world.

1807
01:35:50,317 --> 01:35:53,389
Every time I went over to his house,
it was like I was on vacation.

1808
01:35:53,557 --> 01:35:56,390
Better food, better view, better TV.

1809
01:35:56,557 --> 01:35:58,388
Cleaner. Oh, much cleaner.

1810
01:35:59,517 --> 01:36:00,791
That became my reality.

1811
01:36:01,277 --> 01:36:03,472
I ignored the squalor
in my own life...

1812
01:36:03,637 --> 01:36:06,674
...because I'm looking at life, you see,
through Jerry's eyes.

1813
01:36:08,077 --> 01:36:09,476
I was living in twilight, George.

1814
01:36:09,637 --> 01:36:12,947
Living in the shadows,
living in the darkness...

1815
01:36:13,117 --> 01:36:14,550
...like you.

1816
01:36:17,277 --> 01:36:18,915
- Me?
- Oh, yeah.

1817
01:36:19,077 --> 01:36:20,908
I can barely see you, George.

1818
01:36:22,077 --> 01:36:25,114
All right, stop it, Kramer.
You're freaking me out.

1819
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:27,676
Hi. Are you ready to order?

1820
01:36:27,837 --> 01:36:29,589
- Yeah. What's the...?
- No, not yet.

1821
01:36:29,757 --> 01:36:31,748
Excuse me.

1822
01:36:36,797 --> 01:36:38,071
Do you ever yearn?

1823
01:36:39,597 --> 01:36:41,747
Yearn? Do I yearn?

1824
01:36:42,397 --> 01:36:43,876
- I yearn.
- You yearn?

1825
01:36:44,037 --> 01:36:45,755
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn.

1826
01:36:45,917 --> 01:36:50,035
Often I sit and yearn.

1827
01:36:50,757 --> 01:36:52,554
Have you yearned?

1828
01:36:53,517 --> 01:36:55,747
Well, not recently.

1829
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,388
I craved.

1830
01:36:58,557 --> 01:37:01,117
I crave all the time.
Constant craving.

1831
01:37:01,277 --> 01:37:03,347
But I haven't yearned.

1832
01:37:05,877 --> 01:37:07,868
- Look at you.
- Oh, Kramer, don't start.

1833
01:37:08,037 --> 01:37:10,073
No, no. You're wasting your life.

1834
01:37:10,237 --> 01:37:13,115
I am not.
What you call wasting, I call living.

1835
01:37:13,277 --> 01:37:16,428
- I'm living my life.
- Okay, like what? No, tell me.

1836
01:37:16,597 --> 01:37:18,474
- Do you have a job?
- No.

1837
01:37:18,637 --> 01:37:20,548
- You got money?
- No.

1838
01:37:20,717 --> 01:37:22,548
Do you have a woman?

1839
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:24,470
No.

1840
01:37:24,637 --> 01:37:26,036
Do you have any prospects?

1841
01:37:27,197 --> 01:37:28,949
No.

1842
01:37:29,117 --> 01:37:31,426
You got anything on the horizon?

1843
01:37:34,717 --> 01:37:36,309
No.

1844
01:37:36,957 --> 01:37:40,233
- You have any action at all?
- No.

1845
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,787
Do you have any conceivable reason
for even getting up in the morning?

1846
01:37:44,957 --> 01:37:47,710
I like to get the Daily News.

1847
01:37:49,357 --> 01:37:53,066
George, it's time for us
to grow up and be men...

1848
01:37:53,237 --> 01:37:55,307
...not little boys.
- Why?

1849
01:37:55,477 --> 01:37:57,513
I'm going to California.
You know, I got the bug.

1850
01:37:57,677 --> 01:37:59,827
Yeah, I think I got
a touch of something too.

1851
01:37:59,997 --> 01:38:02,830
No, the acting bug. Ever since
I was in that Woody Allen movie.

1852
01:38:03,517 --> 01:38:06,077
"These pretzels
are making me thirsty"?

1853
01:38:06,237 --> 01:38:08,228
That was one line. You got fired.

1854
01:38:08,397 --> 01:38:11,833
I know, I know.
But, man, I never felt so alive.

1855
01:38:11,997 --> 01:38:15,034
- Now, you coming with me?
- No, I'm not.

1856
01:38:15,197 --> 01:38:17,108
All right. Suit yourself.

1857
01:38:17,277 --> 01:38:18,869
But let's keep this between us.

1858
01:38:19,037 --> 01:38:21,073
We're key brothers now.

1859
01:38:21,517 --> 01:38:23,633
You're not really gonna go
to California, are you?

1860
01:38:23,797 --> 01:38:26,789
Up here, I'm already gone.

1861
01:38:32,637 --> 01:38:34,070
He gave me his spare keys...

1862
01:38:34,237 --> 01:38:36,705
...and now he wants my keys,
so I need mine back from you.

1863
01:38:36,877 --> 01:38:39,027
Because you have his keys?
Why does he need yours?

1864
01:38:39,197 --> 01:38:42,428
I don't know, he said
he wants to be my key brother.

1865
01:38:42,597 --> 01:38:45,350
- That's ridiculous.
- That's Kramer.

1866
01:38:45,997 --> 01:38:49,114
I'll give you back your spare keys,
but now I want mine back.

1867
01:38:49,557 --> 01:38:51,149
What for?

1868
01:38:51,317 --> 01:38:53,877
- Because I'll give them to Jerry.
- Jerry? Why?

1869
01:38:54,037 --> 01:38:56,392
- Because he gave me his.
- So what?

1870
01:38:57,597 --> 01:39:00,475
So if he has my keys,
I should have his.

1871
01:39:00,637 --> 01:39:02,116
I don't see why if you have his...

1872
01:39:02,277 --> 01:39:04,632
...he should have yours.
- I just said the same thing.

1873
01:39:04,797 --> 01:39:07,311
- What?
- What?

1874
01:39:07,477 --> 01:39:09,593
I'll give you my keys,
but I don't have them here.

1875
01:39:09,757 --> 01:39:11,270
Can I have mine to give to Kramer?

1876
01:39:11,677 --> 01:39:14,271
Yeah, okay, I'll go get them.

1877
01:39:15,237 --> 01:39:19,515
What are you doing?
Would you just put that down?

1878
01:39:19,677 --> 01:39:22,032
I gotta get some new friends.

1879
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:25,195
- Did you bring the keys?
- Yes.

1880
01:39:25,357 --> 01:39:28,076
But I still don't feel right
about letting you into Kramer's.

1881
01:39:28,237 --> 01:39:29,556
This could be an emergency.

1882
01:39:29,717 --> 01:39:32,948
- You shouldn't have taken his keys.
- I tried to give them back.

1883
01:39:33,157 --> 01:39:35,591
- How'd the Mets do?
- They lost.

1884
01:39:35,757 --> 01:39:37,793
- Kramer!
- Come on, open it up.

1885
01:39:41,197 --> 01:39:43,757
- Kramer?
- Hello, boys.

1886
01:39:44,517 --> 01:39:47,634
- Hello, Newman.
- Are you looking for someone?

1887
01:39:47,797 --> 01:39:49,833
Don't play coy with me,
I'm not in the mood.

1888
01:39:49,997 --> 01:39:52,113
Coy? I'm not being coy.

1889
01:39:52,277 --> 01:39:53,596
- Is he being coy?
- Yeah, coy.

1890
01:39:53,757 --> 01:39:56,430
You're being coy.
Now, where's Kramer, Newman?

1891
01:39:56,597 --> 01:39:59,395
- Who?
- Listen, Tiny...

1892
01:40:00,157 --> 01:40:02,466
...I wanna know where Kramer is,
and I wanna know now!

1893
01:40:02,637 --> 01:40:05,071
- Hit me, Seinfeld, I got witnesses.
- Turn around, George.

1894
01:40:05,237 --> 01:40:06,386
- Sure.
- George?

1895
01:40:06,557 --> 01:40:08,866
Tell me where Kramer is
or we'll do this the hard way!

1896
01:40:09,037 --> 01:40:10,629
- Help! Help!
- Where's Kramer?

1897
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,150
- Help!
- What's going on?

1898
01:40:12,317 --> 01:40:14,911
- They're gonna beat me up.
- No, we're not.

1899
01:40:15,077 --> 01:40:16,795
We're trying to find Kramer.

1900
01:40:16,957 --> 01:40:19,425
You want to know what happened
to Kramer? I'll tell you.

1901
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:21,349
He was ticked off about the keys.

1902
01:40:21,517 --> 01:40:24,190
Yeah, that's right, about the keys.

1903
01:40:25,117 --> 01:40:26,869
- Thought he got a bad rap.
- Bad rap?

1904
01:40:27,037 --> 01:40:28,356
- Yeah, from you.
- Me?

1905
01:40:28,517 --> 01:40:31,236
You heard me. So he packed a grip
and he split for the coast.

1906
01:40:31,397 --> 01:40:33,274
La-la land. L.A.

1907
01:40:33,917 --> 01:40:35,475
L.A.?

1908
01:41:08,477 --> 01:41:10,672
I never should have taken
his keys away.

1909
01:41:10,837 --> 01:41:13,032
He drove me to it, I had no choice.

1910
01:41:13,197 --> 01:41:14,949
He wouldn't take them back.

1911
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:16,789
Elaine, you saw it. Remember?

1912
01:41:16,957 --> 01:41:19,517
I said, "Take the keys back."
He wouldn't do anything.

1913
01:41:19,677 --> 01:41:21,315
You saw it. Didn't you see it?

1914
01:41:21,477 --> 01:41:23,308
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

1915
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:25,752
I mean, it was complete bull...
But I saw.

1916
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:30,396
- What?
- No, what'd you say?

1917
01:41:30,557 --> 01:41:33,276
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

1918
01:41:35,837 --> 01:41:37,111
Oh, you didn't see it?

1919
01:41:37,277 --> 01:41:39,188
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it.

1920
01:41:39,357 --> 01:41:42,349
- I saw it. Yep.
- I heard you say something there.

1921
01:41:42,517 --> 01:41:46,305
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm calling Kramer's mother.

1922
01:41:49,277 --> 01:41:52,713
I don't know what you said,
but it was something.

1923
01:41:54,357 --> 01:41:56,154
I heard something.

1924
01:41:56,437 --> 01:41:59,190
Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer?

1925
01:41:59,597 --> 01:42:01,155
Mrs. Kramer?

1926
01:42:01,317 --> 01:42:03,956
Could you turn the music down?

1927
01:42:04,117 --> 01:42:06,836
Could you turn the music down?

1928
01:42:07,117 --> 01:42:10,473
- Ask her about Kramer.
- She's drunk out of her mind.

1929
01:42:28,717 --> 01:42:31,231
Oh, my keys.

1930
01:42:33,477 --> 01:42:35,752
This is perfect.

1931
01:42:39,477 --> 01:42:41,911
Elaine, are you there?

1932
01:42:42,557 --> 01:42:45,947
It's me. I'm locked out.
I need my spare keys. Where are you?

1933
01:42:46,117 --> 01:42:48,153
I'm at the coffee shop.

1934
01:42:51,437 --> 01:42:54,713
Hey! You ever been in an accident?

1935
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:56,629
About five years ago.

1936
01:42:57,357 --> 01:42:59,917
I was going down this very road.

1937
01:43:00,077 --> 01:43:04,753
Same time of day, going about
the same speed I'm going now.

1938
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:06,794
There was a rock in the road.

1939
01:43:06,957 --> 01:43:08,834
It couldn't have been
more than a pebble.

1940
01:43:08,997 --> 01:43:11,033
Never really saw it.

1941
01:43:11,197 --> 01:43:15,588
Lost control of the bike,
went flying about a hundred feet.

1942
01:43:15,757 --> 01:43:17,827
Came down right on my head.

1943
01:43:17,997 --> 01:43:19,669
Cracked it wide open.

1944
01:43:19,837 --> 01:43:23,830
Blood and stuff just splattered
all over the road there.

1945
01:43:24,197 --> 01:43:26,950
Broke every bone in my face.

1946
01:43:27,837 --> 01:43:29,316
You know, when they found me...

1947
01:43:29,477 --> 01:43:32,549
...my eyes were hanging out
of their sockets.

1948
01:43:33,077 --> 01:43:35,716
Yeah, they pronounced me dead
at the scene.

1949
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:39,836
Was in a coma for...
Well, they told me about a year.

1950
01:43:39,997 --> 01:43:42,716
Said I'd be a vegetable for life.

1951
01:43:42,877 --> 01:43:45,596
Yeah, but I showed them.

1952
01:43:45,797 --> 01:43:49,028
Of course, since then,
I always wear a helmet.

1953
01:43:49,317 --> 01:43:50,875
Lean.

1954
01:43:51,797 --> 01:43:53,549
Lean!

1955
01:43:58,397 --> 01:43:59,989
Georgie boy.

1956
01:44:00,157 --> 01:44:02,432
Way to come through with the keys.

1957
01:44:02,597 --> 01:44:05,669
- Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
- Look...

1958
01:44:05,917 --> 01:44:09,273
...I just don't feel right about
letting you into Elaine's apartment.

1959
01:44:11,157 --> 01:44:13,352
Don't feel right?
What are you talking about?

1960
01:44:13,517 --> 01:44:15,985
I let you into Kramer's.
Now you wanna go into Elaine's.

1961
01:44:16,157 --> 01:44:18,671
She entrusted me with her keys.
How can I just let you in?

1962
01:44:18,837 --> 01:44:20,270
What is the big deal?

1963
01:44:20,437 --> 01:44:22,348
Just because you have
someone's spare keys...

1964
01:44:22,517 --> 01:44:24,109
...doesn't entitle you to break in.

1965
01:44:24,277 --> 01:44:26,108
That's the reason you took
Kramer's keys.

1966
01:44:26,277 --> 01:44:28,268
You're not even supposed
to have Elaine's keys.

1967
01:44:28,437 --> 01:44:31,190
You're supposed to give them to her
so she can give them to me.

1968
01:44:31,357 --> 01:44:33,427
So technically, those are my keys.

1969
01:44:33,597 --> 01:44:35,508
If you'd never taken your keys
from Kramer...

1970
01:44:35,677 --> 01:44:37,269
...he never would have given
his to me.

1971
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:40,315
In which case, I wouldn't have
had to take mine back from her.

1972
01:44:41,357 --> 01:44:42,995
- I want those keys.
- No can do.

1973
01:44:43,157 --> 01:44:45,034
- George, I want these.
- Stop it, let go.

1974
01:44:45,197 --> 01:44:47,995
- George, I don't want to get physical.
- You wanna fight?

1975
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:49,431
- Wanna fight?
- I'll fight you!

1976
01:44:49,597 --> 01:44:51,030
- Let's go.
- Nothing in the face!

1977
01:44:51,197 --> 01:44:52,869
- Okay.
- All right.

1978
01:44:56,157 --> 01:44:59,832
And then the evil ogre
took back the magical keys...

1979
01:44:59,997 --> 01:45:01,555
...from the handsome young prince.

1980
01:45:03,957 --> 01:45:06,471
Oh, no. He didn't
take back the keys.

1981
01:45:06,637 --> 01:45:08,309
- No way.
- Yes.

1982
01:45:08,477 --> 01:45:10,229
And then the handsome
young prince...

1983
01:45:10,397 --> 01:45:13,195
...was cast out
into the cruel, cruel world.

1984
01:45:13,357 --> 01:45:14,995
Oh, man, what a bummer.

1985
01:45:15,157 --> 01:45:17,387
- That ogre dude is pretty cold, huh?
- He's cold.

1986
01:45:17,557 --> 01:45:19,036
Let me tell you something, Kramer.

1987
01:45:19,197 --> 01:45:22,394
If that ogre dude pulled
that crap on me...

1988
01:45:22,557 --> 01:45:23,785
...l'd stab him!
- Wait.

1989
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:25,436
I'd cut him in half!

1990
01:45:25,597 --> 01:45:28,157
I'd gut him like a fish, man!

1991
01:45:28,317 --> 01:45:31,354
- That's what I'd do.
- Yeah, yeah. That'd be funny.

1992
01:45:31,517 --> 01:45:33,075
Hey, you can drop me here.

1993
01:45:33,237 --> 01:45:34,590
Hey, what's the rush, man?

1994
01:45:34,757 --> 01:45:37,112
- Well, I got to be going now.
- Hey, Kramer...

1995
01:45:37,277 --> 01:45:39,108
...have you ever killed a man?

1996
01:45:39,277 --> 01:45:40,471
What do you think?

1997
01:45:40,637 --> 01:45:44,630
You think these hands have been
soaking in lvory Liquid, huh?

1998
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:47,357
Oh, don't leave, Kramer.
Stay with us.

1999
01:45:47,517 --> 01:45:49,712
Oh, you know so much
about the world. We need you.

2000
01:45:49,877 --> 01:45:52,311
- Please, Kramer.
- Please, Kramer.

2001
01:45:52,477 --> 01:45:53,990
Well, now, Star Cloud...

2002
01:45:54,157 --> 01:45:55,795
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Please, Kramer.

2003
01:45:55,957 --> 01:45:59,029
- No, no, no.
- Please, Kramer.

2004
01:45:59,797 --> 01:46:01,753
See? You're avoiding
the middleman.

2005
01:46:01,917 --> 01:46:04,431
You'd give her her keys,
which she would give to me.

2006
01:46:04,597 --> 01:46:07,509
So instead of giving them to her,
you give them to me.

2007
01:46:07,677 --> 01:46:10,794
Unfortunately, when she gave
you yours, you didn't give her hers.

2008
01:46:10,957 --> 01:46:12,868
She'd give them to me
because she has mine.

2009
01:46:13,037 --> 01:46:14,868
Then I wouldn't have to ask you
for hers...

2010
01:46:15,037 --> 01:46:17,073
...so that I could get mine.

2011
01:46:19,917 --> 01:46:22,477
You're right. How did I miss that?

2012
01:46:24,157 --> 01:46:26,717
Maybe because it's a crock of sh...

2013
01:46:27,877 --> 01:46:30,710
- What's that?
- Nothing.

2014
01:46:33,917 --> 01:46:36,477
- I heard something.
- Didn't say anything.

2015
01:46:40,957 --> 01:46:43,232
So how long you been driving
this thing?

2016
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:45,274
Going on four years.

2017
01:46:46,517 --> 01:46:49,987
Well, nothing's sexier than a woman
behind the wheel of a semi.

2018
01:46:50,677 --> 01:46:52,235
Nothing?

2019
01:46:52,437 --> 01:46:54,029
Well...

2020
01:46:58,077 --> 01:47:00,955
Listen to you.
You're quite the sweet talker.

2021
01:47:01,117 --> 01:47:03,187
I always wanted to drive
the big rigs.

2022
01:47:03,357 --> 01:47:06,474
I used to watch those commercials
during reruns of Gomer Pyle.

2023
01:47:06,637 --> 01:47:09,276
- You wanna give it a try?
- Really?

2024
01:47:10,717 --> 01:47:13,595
- Do you know how to double-clutch?
- Yeah.

2025
01:47:13,917 --> 01:47:16,351
- Well, come on.
- Wait a minute.

2026
01:47:16,517 --> 01:47:18,075
Wait.

2027
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:24,310
Okay. All right.

2028
01:47:37,877 --> 01:47:39,788
They were in here.
I saw her put them in here.

2029
01:47:39,957 --> 01:47:41,595
Well, this is great.

2030
01:47:41,757 --> 01:47:43,634
- What do they look like?
- Like keys.

2031
01:47:43,797 --> 01:47:45,788
They look like keys, George.

2032
01:47:45,957 --> 01:47:48,790
They look exactly like keys.

2033
01:47:48,957 --> 01:47:51,835
"What do they look like?"

2034
01:47:52,317 --> 01:47:54,990
- They're obviously not here.
- They've got to be here.

2035
01:47:55,157 --> 01:48:00,026
Jerry, unless I pull down on this
statuette and a hidden wall opens up...

2036
01:48:00,197 --> 01:48:02,552
...we have checked every square inch
of this apartment.

2037
01:48:04,237 --> 01:48:06,034
What is this?

2038
01:48:07,597 --> 01:48:10,555
- "Murphy Brown"?
- What?

2039
01:48:10,957 --> 01:48:12,948
- "By Elaine Benes"?
- What?

2040
01:48:13,117 --> 01:48:15,347
Elaine's writing a Murphy Brown?

2041
01:48:16,197 --> 01:48:17,710
- Let me see this.
- Wait a second.

2042
01:48:17,877 --> 01:48:19,515
- Let me just look at it.
- Wait.

2043
01:48:19,677 --> 01:48:22,874
- Give me half!
- All right, here!

2044
01:48:24,157 --> 01:48:26,148
Why didn't she tell us?

2045
01:48:26,317 --> 01:48:30,390
Elaine is writing a sitcom?

2046
01:48:35,397 --> 01:48:38,355
- You... You weasels!
- What?

2047
01:48:38,517 --> 01:48:39,791
- What?
- How dare you!

2048
01:48:39,957 --> 01:48:41,754
- We hardly read anything.
- It was funny.

2049
01:48:41,917 --> 01:48:43,475
Who gave you permission
to come in...

2050
01:48:43,637 --> 01:48:45,195
...and just go through my things?

2051
01:48:45,357 --> 01:48:48,155
- You thought it was funny?
- Well, you know...

2052
01:48:48,437 --> 01:48:51,190
...from what I saw...
- Well, it's just a first draft!

2053
01:48:51,357 --> 01:48:53,552
I was locked out.
I'm just trying to get my keys.

2054
01:48:54,077 --> 01:48:56,466
- Why did you let him in?
- He forced me to.

2055
01:48:56,637 --> 01:48:57,786
- I did not!
- Yes, you did!

2056
01:48:57,957 --> 01:49:01,506
- You, get out! Get out!
- Wait, I need my spare keys.

2057
01:49:01,677 --> 01:49:03,668
Oh, here's your damn keys.
You keep them.

2058
01:49:03,837 --> 01:49:05,270
- I don't want them anymore.
- Good.

2059
01:49:05,437 --> 01:49:06,870
I want my keys back from you.

2060
01:49:07,037 --> 01:49:09,267
- I can't hold them?
- No, you can't be trusted.

2061
01:49:09,437 --> 01:49:11,428
All right, all right. Fine!

2062
01:49:11,597 --> 01:49:14,236
- And I don't want you to hold mine.
- Good, I won't!

2063
01:49:14,397 --> 01:49:15,546
Good, don't.

2064
01:49:15,717 --> 01:49:17,708
- Are these my keys?
- These aren't my keys.

2065
01:49:17,877 --> 01:49:20,311
- Whose are these?
- I don't know.

2066
01:49:20,477 --> 01:49:22,229
No, those are yours...

2067
01:49:32,677 --> 01:49:34,554
I just thought I could write it.

2068
01:49:34,717 --> 01:49:36,673
Is that something you wanna do?

2069
01:49:36,837 --> 01:49:38,589
I don't know.

2070
01:49:38,757 --> 01:49:41,794
Those writers make a lot of money.

2071
01:49:43,877 --> 01:49:45,105
What?

2072
01:49:45,277 --> 01:49:47,472
Let me tell you something
about show business.

2073
01:49:48,797 --> 01:49:51,072
- I can't believe it.
- It's hard work.

2074
01:49:51,237 --> 01:49:53,228
You don't just write
a Murphy Brown.

2075
01:49:53,397 --> 01:49:55,957
You gotta watch the show,
get a sense of the characters...

2076
01:49:56,117 --> 01:49:57,755
...how they relate to each other.

2077
01:49:57,917 --> 01:50:00,636
Okay, can I just watch the show?

2078
01:50:02,397 --> 01:50:05,355
Oh, God, what an ass...

2079
01:50:10,517 --> 01:50:12,348
What did you say?

2080
01:50:13,917 --> 01:50:15,828
I didn't say anything.

2081
01:50:17,117 --> 01:50:19,187
I heard something.

2082
01:50:20,597 --> 01:50:22,076
Elaine, Elaine, it's Kramer!

2083
01:50:22,237 --> 01:50:24,876
Kramer's on Murphy Brown!

2084
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:28,033
- Kramer's on Murphy Brown!
- Look, there he is!

2085
01:50:28,197 --> 01:50:30,392
He's sitting at the desk!

2086
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:32,151
Hi, I'm Murphy Brown.

2087
01:50:32,317 --> 01:50:35,070
- You must be my new secretary.
- Good morning, Miss Brown.

2088
01:50:35,237 --> 01:50:38,115
- And you are?
- I'm Steven Snell.

2089
01:50:38,277 --> 01:50:39,915
- Snell.
- Yes.

2090
01:50:40,077 --> 01:50:41,874
Well, hello, Mr. Snell.

2091
01:50:42,037 --> 01:50:43,311
Steven.

2092
01:50:43,477 --> 01:50:44,626
- Steven.
- Yes.

2093
01:50:44,797 --> 01:50:46,628
Are you familiar with this
computer system?

2094
01:50:46,797 --> 01:50:49,675
Oh, I'm familiar, yes.

2095
01:50:49,837 --> 01:50:52,635
Steven Snell, I know people...

2096
01:50:52,797 --> 01:50:55,186
...and I have a very good feeling
about you.

2097
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:57,188
Yes.

2098
01:51:06,677 --> 01:51:09,749
So I fly a lot. I was on a plane
the other day and I was wondering...

2099
01:51:09,917 --> 01:51:13,751
...are there keys to the plane?
Do they need keys to start the plane?

2100
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,432
Maybe that's what those delays on the
ground are sometimes, at the gate.

2101
01:51:17,597 --> 01:51:19,667
Maybe the pilot's up in
the cockpit going:

2102
01:51:19,837 --> 01:51:21,668
"Oh, I don't believe this.

2103
01:51:21,837 --> 01:51:23,828
Oh, my God...

2104
01:51:23,997 --> 01:51:25,988
...I did it again."

2105
01:51:26,557 --> 01:51:27,831
They tell you it's mechanical.

2106
01:51:27,997 --> 01:51:29,953
They don't want to come on
the PA system:

2107
01:51:30,117 --> 01:51:31,311
"Ladies and gentlemen...

2108
01:51:31,477 --> 01:51:33,991
...we're gonna be delayed here
a little while. I...

2109
01:51:34,277 --> 01:51:36,791
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.

2110
01:51:36,957 --> 01:51:39,710
I left the keys to the plane
in my apartment."

2111
01:51:39,877 --> 01:51:42,391
You see technicians,
you think they're servicing it...

2112
01:51:42,557 --> 01:51:45,708
...but they're looking for the magnet
Hide-A-Key under the wing.

2113
01:51:45,877 --> 01:51:48,471
"Maybe he left it up there
somewhere."

2114
01:52:34,197 --> 01:52:36,188
Subtitles by
SDI Media Group

2115
01:52:42,096 --> 01:52:44,485
In parking lots, they have this
"compact car only" spot.

2116
01:52:44,656 --> 01:52:47,454
Isn't that discrimination
against the size of your car?

2117
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:50,733
If I want my ass hanging out
of the back of my parking spot...

2118
01:52:50,896 --> 01:52:53,091
...that's my business.

2119
01:52:53,256 --> 01:52:55,850
There are people with real asses
hanging out of their pants.

2120
01:52:56,016 --> 01:52:57,813
Nobody's stopping them.

2121
01:52:59,496 --> 01:53:01,930
Nobody goes, " Hey, hold it, sir.
Those are compact jeans.

2122
01:53:02,096 --> 01:53:04,087
You can't pull that in there."

2123
01:53:10,896 --> 01:53:12,045
Hey.

2124
01:53:13,296 --> 01:53:14,729
I got bad news for you, buddy.

2125
01:53:14,896 --> 01:53:16,807
I think your car got stolen again.

2126
01:53:16,976 --> 01:53:18,409
What are you talking about?

2127
01:53:18,576 --> 01:53:20,248
You parked on 84th
and Columbus, right?

2128
01:53:20,416 --> 01:53:23,965
I just walked by there,
and that car is gone.

2129
01:53:24,376 --> 01:53:25,604
Yeah, I know.

2130
01:53:25,776 --> 01:53:27,050
Well, where is it?

2131
01:53:27,216 --> 01:53:28,365
What's the difference?

2132
01:53:28,536 --> 01:53:31,528
Well, there's no difference.
You know, I'm just curious.

2133
01:53:31,696 --> 01:53:34,210
Always have to know everything
that's going on, don't you?

2134
01:53:34,376 --> 01:53:38,005
- What happened to the car?
- lf I don't tell you, it'll kill you, won't it?

2135
01:53:38,176 --> 01:53:40,132
- Yeah, yeah. It'll kill me.
- You have to know.

2136
01:53:40,296 --> 01:53:43,174
- You must know.
- I must know.

2137
01:53:44,696 --> 01:53:46,254
Well, I'm not telling you.

2138
01:53:46,416 --> 01:53:47,735
Come on.

2139
01:53:47,896 --> 01:53:49,170
Nope. I don't think so.

2140
01:53:49,336 --> 01:53:51,850
- Well, please?
- Not today, pal.

2141
01:53:52,016 --> 01:53:53,210
Okay, I beg you.

2142
01:53:53,776 --> 01:53:56,654
Now, see, just saying "beg"
doesn't make it a real beg.

2143
01:53:56,816 --> 01:53:58,169
You gotta put some beg into it.

2144
01:53:58,336 --> 01:54:01,328
Okay. Please!
Please tell me!

2145
01:54:02,256 --> 01:54:04,326
All right, but your begging
needs a lot of work.

2146
01:54:04,496 --> 01:54:07,568
- Okay, okay. What is it?
- I loaned the car to George.

2147
01:54:07,736 --> 01:54:09,567
George. All right.

2148
01:54:09,736 --> 01:54:11,454
Well, what for?

2149
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,532
George and Elaine went to
a flea market in Westchester. Okay?

2150
01:54:15,696 --> 01:54:17,368
All right.

2151
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,970
Why'd they go there?

2152
01:54:21,136 --> 01:54:22,808
Would you stop it, already?

2153
01:54:22,976 --> 01:54:24,932
- Why didn't they ask me to go?
- I don't know!

2154
01:54:25,096 --> 01:54:27,212
How am I supposed to know?

2155
01:54:27,896 --> 01:54:30,535
- What, they don't like me?
- I don't like you.

2156
01:54:30,696 --> 01:54:33,051
Well, if they liked me,
why didn't they ask me to go?

2157
01:54:33,736 --> 01:54:35,613
Yeah.

2158
01:54:42,256 --> 01:54:44,326
I really think it looks good.

2159
01:54:44,496 --> 01:54:46,805
Ten bucks.
How can you go wrong?

2160
01:54:46,976 --> 01:54:49,092
All bald people look good in hats.

2161
01:54:49,296 --> 01:54:53,084
You should have lived in the '20s and
'30s. Men wore hats all the time then.

2162
01:54:53,256 --> 01:54:55,645
What a bald paradise
that must have been.

2163
01:54:56,176 --> 01:54:57,529
Nobody knew.

2164
01:54:58,736 --> 01:55:00,294
You can wear a hat all the time now.

2165
01:55:00,456 --> 01:55:02,526
- Who's stopping you?
- No, I can't.

2166
01:55:02,696 --> 01:55:04,209
What if I meet a woman?

2167
01:55:04,376 --> 01:55:07,129
I'd always worry about that first
moment where I take it off...

2168
01:55:07,296 --> 01:55:10,254
...and see that look of disappointment
on her face.

2169
01:55:10,736 --> 01:55:12,772
You sure you like
these sunglasses?

2170
01:55:16,336 --> 01:55:17,564
Man.

2171
01:55:17,736 --> 01:55:20,011
Well, I'm very disappointed
in George and Elaine.

2172
01:55:20,176 --> 01:55:23,612
And you know I'm somebody you don't
wanna have on your bad side.

2173
01:55:24,656 --> 01:55:26,692
- Why not?
- Because I'm like ice, buddy.

2174
01:55:26,856 --> 01:55:28,574
When I don't like you,
you got problems.

2175
01:55:31,776 --> 01:55:35,689
- Is this for the fight?
- Yeah. Starts in 35 minutes.

2176
01:55:40,496 --> 01:55:41,724
Yeah.

2177
01:55:42,056 --> 01:55:44,411
Hey, I invited Mike Moffett.
You don't mind, do you?

2178
01:55:44,976 --> 01:55:46,375
No. I like Mike.

2179
01:55:46,976 --> 01:55:50,048
I just got off the phone with him.
We had a great conversation.

2180
01:55:50,216 --> 01:55:54,175
- Yeah? What did you talk about?
- Actually, we talked about you.

2181
01:55:54,976 --> 01:55:58,173
Yeah. He had some pretty
interesting things to say.

2182
01:55:58,536 --> 01:56:00,606
Yeah? What did he say?

2183
01:56:00,776 --> 01:56:03,336
You have to know everything,
don't you?

2184
01:56:04,216 --> 01:56:05,854
- Come on. What'd he say?
- Why is that?

2185
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,768
Why do you have
to know everything?

2186
01:56:07,936 --> 01:56:10,689
- Kramer, just tell me what he said.
- Beg me.

2187
01:56:11,896 --> 01:56:14,205
- Please don't make me beg.
- No, I want you to beg me.

2188
01:56:14,376 --> 01:56:17,686
And I don't want you to say it. I want
you to put some beg in it. Go on.

2189
01:56:17,856 --> 01:56:20,131
Kramer, please tell me
what the guy said.

2190
01:56:20,296 --> 01:56:22,252
No, no. That's no good.

2191
01:56:22,416 --> 01:56:24,327
No, I really don't think that's a beg.

2192
01:56:24,496 --> 01:56:26,646
No way. It's close, but...

2193
01:56:26,816 --> 01:56:29,171
- Kramer!
- Look, I can't say anything.

2194
01:56:29,336 --> 01:56:32,248
The guy told me this stuff in
confidence. I'd be betraying a friend.

2195
01:56:32,416 --> 01:56:34,805
Well, you can't just mention it
and then not tell me.

2196
01:56:35,336 --> 01:56:37,930
All right. I'll tell you,
but you can't say anything to him.

2197
01:56:38,096 --> 01:56:40,326
I'm not saying anything.
I'm putting it in the vault.

2198
01:56:40,496 --> 01:56:42,566
I'm locking the vault.
It's a vault!

2199
01:56:42,736 --> 01:56:45,614
- He thinks you're a phoney.
- He what?

2200
01:56:45,776 --> 01:56:47,653
I told you. He thinks you're a phoney.

2201
01:56:47,816 --> 01:56:50,649
- A phoney? He called me a phoney?
- A big phoney.

2202
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:52,647
Big one.

2203
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:56,168
Why did you tell me that
if I can't say anything?

2204
01:56:56,336 --> 01:56:57,928
You begged me.

2205
01:57:02,056 --> 01:57:03,205
Do you hear that?

2206
01:57:03,376 --> 01:57:05,014
Of course I hear that.

2207
01:57:05,176 --> 01:57:06,734
You had to move the mirror.

2208
01:57:06,896 --> 01:57:08,534
I wanted to check out
my sunglasses.

2209
01:57:08,696 --> 01:57:11,688
Went to look in the mirror, it was gone.
You threw off my equilibrium.

2210
01:57:11,856 --> 01:57:14,848
Yeah. Blame it on me
because you can't drive, George.

2211
01:57:15,016 --> 01:57:16,608
- I can't drive?
- Yeah.

2212
01:57:16,776 --> 01:57:18,528
Nobody drives like me. Nobody.

2213
01:57:18,696 --> 01:57:21,415
I'm doing things in this car,
you have no idea they're going on.

2214
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:23,407
Want to see a right turn
from the left lane?

2215
01:57:23,576 --> 01:57:25,248
No, I really don't.

2216
01:57:25,936 --> 01:57:28,655
- I can make a left from the right lane.
- I'm sure you could.

2217
01:57:29,176 --> 01:57:31,644
- What are we gonna tell Jerry?
- I don't know.

2218
01:57:31,816 --> 01:57:33,374
Start looking for spaces.

2219
01:57:33,536 --> 01:57:36,733
You're never gonna find a space on
Jerry's block. Just put it in a garage.

2220
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,854
Look, I have my system.
First, I look for the dream spot...

2221
01:57:40,016 --> 01:57:43,611
...in front of the door, then I slowly
expand out in concentric circles.

2222
01:57:43,776 --> 01:57:46,290
No. Come on, George.
Please put it in a garage.

2223
01:57:46,456 --> 01:57:48,765
I don't wanna spend an hour
looking for a space.

2224
01:57:48,936 --> 01:57:50,733
I can't park in a garage.

2225
01:57:50,896 --> 01:57:52,966
- Why?
- I don't know. I just can't.

2226
01:57:53,136 --> 01:57:55,696
Nobody in my family can pay
for parking. It's a sickness.

2227
01:57:56,016 --> 01:57:59,645
My father never paid for parking.
My mother. My brother. Nobody.

2228
01:57:59,816 --> 01:58:02,728
- I'll pay for it.
- You don't understand.

2229
01:58:03,536 --> 01:58:05,174
A garage.

2230
01:58:05,336 --> 01:58:06,974
I can't even pull in there.

2231
01:58:07,136 --> 01:58:08,854
It's like going to a prostitute.

2232
01:58:09,016 --> 01:58:13,885
Why should I pay when, if I apply
myself, maybe I could get it for free?

2233
01:58:14,256 --> 01:58:16,645
What? What do you want?

2234
01:58:17,256 --> 01:58:19,406
Go around me.
I'm looking for spaces.

2235
01:58:19,656 --> 01:58:21,214
George! There's
a space right there!

2236
01:58:21,376 --> 01:58:23,332
- Beautiful.
- You just passed it, see?

2237
01:58:23,536 --> 01:58:27,529
Look at that, the dream space.
Right in front of Jerry's building.

2238
01:58:27,696 --> 01:58:30,085
Dreams can come true.
What did I tell you?

2239
01:58:30,256 --> 01:58:32,929
You didn't even have to
take it out to dinner.

2240
01:58:35,456 --> 01:58:39,688
All right, now you're gonna see
some parallel parking.

2241
01:58:40,016 --> 01:58:43,725
I wish you could make a living
parallel parking.

2242
01:58:43,896 --> 01:58:47,525
It's all geometry,
knowing all the angles...

2243
01:58:47,696 --> 01:58:49,926
...when to make that first turn
and when to...

2244
01:58:50,096 --> 01:58:51,927
...swing it back in.
That's the key.

2245
01:58:52,096 --> 01:58:53,814
Will you just park it, already?

2246
01:58:53,976 --> 01:58:56,536
There's nothing I can impart to you.
That's the sad thing.

2247
01:58:56,696 --> 01:58:58,573
It's so inborn.

2248
01:58:58,736 --> 01:59:00,567
I can't pass it on.

2249
01:59:02,736 --> 01:59:04,215
Look at this guy.

2250
01:59:04,376 --> 01:59:06,844
What, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

2251
01:59:07,056 --> 01:59:09,729
Hey, hey! You're stealing
my space!

2252
01:59:09,896 --> 01:59:11,614
Wait, you don't know who this guy is!

2253
01:59:11,776 --> 01:59:13,846
People kill for a parking space
in this city.

2254
01:59:14,016 --> 01:59:16,246
- He's not getting away with this.
- George!

2255
01:59:16,496 --> 01:59:18,009
What are you doing?

2256
01:59:18,176 --> 01:59:19,609
I think I'm parking my car.

2257
01:59:19,776 --> 01:59:22,654
You can't do that. You can't sneak
in from the back like that.

2258
01:59:22,816 --> 01:59:24,329
I'm not sneaking!

2259
01:59:24,496 --> 01:59:27,294
I didn't even know you were parking.
You were just sitting there.

2260
01:59:27,456 --> 01:59:30,414
If you didn't think I was parking,
why did you put it in headfirst?

2261
01:59:30,576 --> 01:59:32,089
That's the way I park!

2262
01:59:32,816 --> 01:59:34,886
You didn't start backing in
until I pulled in.

2263
01:59:35,056 --> 01:59:36,808
I was in the middle of a conversation.

2264
01:59:36,976 --> 01:59:38,409
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?

2265
01:59:38,576 --> 01:59:40,168
The point is, I was here first.

2266
01:59:40,336 --> 01:59:42,088
I was closer to this space
than you were!

2267
01:59:42,256 --> 01:59:44,895
But I'm backing in,
you can't put it in headfirst!

2268
01:59:45,056 --> 01:59:46,887
I can if I have room!

2269
01:59:48,136 --> 01:59:49,535
Are you gonna move the car?

2270
01:59:49,896 --> 01:59:51,454
No, I'm not gonna move the car.

2271
01:59:52,856 --> 01:59:55,495
- Jerk.
- You're not?

2272
01:59:55,656 --> 01:59:57,931
- You believe this guy?
- We'll put it in the garage.

2273
01:59:58,096 --> 02:00:00,485
I am not putting it in the garage.
It's my space.

2274
02:00:00,656 --> 02:00:03,216
What are you gonna do, you're
gonna leave it here like this?

2275
02:00:03,376 --> 02:00:05,492
- I'm going upstairs.
- Are you coming back down?

2276
02:00:05,656 --> 02:00:08,295
I gotta tell Jerry we're here.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

2277
02:00:08,456 --> 02:00:10,572
Make sure he reserves
the good chair for me.

2278
02:00:10,736 --> 02:00:13,125
What are we gonna tell him
about the clanking noise?

2279
02:00:13,536 --> 02:00:15,527
Me? No, no, no. You.
You're gonna tell him.

2280
02:00:15,696 --> 02:00:17,846
- I'm not gonna... No!
- You're good at this.

2281
02:00:18,016 --> 02:00:19,654
- What am I gonna say?
- I don't know.

2282
02:00:19,816 --> 02:00:22,250
You'll think of something.
Just break it to him gently.

2283
02:00:22,416 --> 02:00:23,815
Man!

2284
02:00:34,896 --> 02:00:37,888
Oh, my God. I need a drink.
Got any Hennigan's here?

2285
02:00:38,056 --> 02:00:39,694
Yeah. Under the counter.
What happened?

2286
02:00:39,856 --> 02:00:44,930
God. Jerry, it was so terrible, what we
just went through on the way home.

2287
02:00:46,096 --> 02:00:47,654
You wouldn't believe it.

2288
02:00:47,816 --> 02:00:50,046
What? Tell me what happened.

2289
02:00:58,616 --> 02:01:00,527
Okay. Now listen.

2290
02:01:01,416 --> 02:01:04,533
We were at the tollbooth at the
Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?

2291
02:01:04,696 --> 02:01:07,130
And there were these, like,
this pack...

2292
02:01:07,296 --> 02:01:11,608
...of extremely wild teenagers
in a convertible behind us, okay?

2293
02:01:11,776 --> 02:01:15,132
And for some reason, I don't know,
they just started to taunt us.

2294
02:01:15,296 --> 02:01:19,005
And so... So then we paid the toll,
and then we went through...

2295
02:01:19,176 --> 02:01:20,894
...and then they started to follow us!

2296
02:01:21,056 --> 02:01:23,524
So George tries to lose them,
and... And...

2297
02:01:23,696 --> 02:01:26,733
But... But they were in this really...
Like a souped-up car, you know?

2298
02:01:26,896 --> 02:01:29,774
And so he turned
off the road really suddenly...

2299
02:01:29,936 --> 02:01:33,326
...and the car was on two wheels,
and I was just screaming...

2300
02:01:33,496 --> 02:01:36,329
...and then...
George is such a great driver.

2301
02:01:36,496 --> 02:01:39,010
- He is?
- He is fantastic.

2302
02:01:39,176 --> 02:01:41,895
And then they fired
a gun right up in the air!

2303
02:01:42,056 --> 02:01:45,366
- A gun?
- I think it was a gun.

2304
02:01:45,536 --> 02:01:48,004
And then they followed us
all the way into the city.

2305
02:01:48,176 --> 02:01:52,089
And then they stopped, and they
turned around and they went home.

2306
02:01:55,576 --> 02:01:57,646
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

2307
02:01:57,816 --> 02:02:00,489
- Yeah, yeah. I'm all right. God.
- Oh, man.

2308
02:02:01,256 --> 02:02:05,932
By the way, the car hit a pothole,
and now it's making a clanking noise.

2309
02:02:06,536 --> 02:02:09,812
Well, I mean,
as long as you're okay, that...

2310
02:02:13,136 --> 02:02:14,967
That's the important thing.

2311
02:02:15,456 --> 02:02:16,684
Exactly.

2312
02:02:17,536 --> 02:02:18,730
Where's George now?

2313
02:02:18,976 --> 02:02:22,412
He's out in front arguing
with some guy about a parking space.

2314
02:02:22,576 --> 02:02:25,295
- What are you talking about?
- Look out the window, you'll see.

2315
02:02:26,896 --> 02:02:28,249
Hey, Georgie!

2316
02:02:28,416 --> 02:02:29,610
Hey!

2317
02:02:29,776 --> 02:02:31,528
Are you okay?

2318
02:02:31,696 --> 02:02:32,970
Yeah. I'm fine.

2319
02:02:33,136 --> 02:02:35,491
Crazy kids, huh?

2320
02:02:35,656 --> 02:02:36,645
What?

2321
02:02:40,656 --> 02:02:42,328
It's my cuticle.

2322
02:02:44,856 --> 02:02:46,414
Is that Jerry?

2323
02:02:46,576 --> 02:02:48,965
- Jerry!
- Hey, Mike.

2324
02:02:49,296 --> 02:02:50,615
What, you know Jerry?

2325
02:02:50,776 --> 02:02:53,210
- Yeah, I know Jerry.
- How do you know him?

2326
02:02:53,376 --> 02:02:55,492
- What's the difference?
- Because I know him too...

2327
02:02:55,656 --> 02:02:58,966
...and probably a lot better than you.
- Well, bully for you.

2328
02:02:59,656 --> 02:03:03,615
Hey, Jerry. You know, your friend
here is a real piece of work!

2329
02:03:03,776 --> 02:03:06,574
- I'm coming down.
- Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?

2330
02:03:06,736 --> 02:03:08,567
What, you know Kramer?

2331
02:03:11,816 --> 02:03:14,330
- Hi.
- Hello.

2332
02:03:24,176 --> 02:03:27,327
Hey, your friend Mike's outside.
He wants to talk to you.

2333
02:03:29,296 --> 02:03:30,570
Hey, Mike!

2334
02:03:30,736 --> 02:03:32,806
Come on up!
The fight's almost starting.

2335
02:03:32,976 --> 02:03:35,854
- You're watching the fight at Jerry's?
- Yeah.

2336
02:03:36,016 --> 02:03:37,529
Oh, great.

2337
02:03:37,776 --> 02:03:40,415
- You know that guy downstairs?
- Yeah. He's a real phoney.

2338
02:03:42,416 --> 02:03:43,610
What's going on?

2339
02:03:43,776 --> 02:03:46,415
Will you come on down?
This guy's in my space!

2340
02:03:46,576 --> 02:03:47,929
It's my space!

2341
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:49,529
I'll be down in a minute.

2342
02:03:52,896 --> 02:03:55,364
- Are you going down?
- Yeah.

2343
02:03:56,656 --> 02:04:00,251
- Is anything wrong?
- Why should anything be wrong?

2344
02:04:01,536 --> 02:04:03,128
I'll be down in a minute.

2345
02:04:06,336 --> 02:04:07,610
Hey, pal.

2346
02:04:08,816 --> 02:04:10,488
You're not getting that space.

2347
02:04:11,056 --> 02:04:13,092
I mean, I'll sleep in my car
if I have to.

2348
02:04:14,256 --> 02:04:16,008
I'll die out here.

2349
02:04:17,096 --> 02:04:18,495
He was down there.

2350
02:04:18,656 --> 02:04:21,124
Once he passed his front bumper,
it's no longer his space.

2351
02:04:21,296 --> 02:04:24,652
- No. It doesn't matter. He was here...
- Hey, Jerry.

2352
02:04:25,376 --> 02:04:27,970
- Long time no see.
- Hi, Mike.

2353
02:04:28,136 --> 02:04:29,774
- Indiana.
- Hey, Krame.

2354
02:04:31,176 --> 02:04:34,213
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know him.

2355
02:04:34,976 --> 02:04:36,295
You're looking tremendous.

2356
02:04:36,456 --> 02:04:37,775
What, are you on some regimen?

2357
02:04:37,936 --> 02:04:39,210
Yeah, 25-percent bran flakes.

2358
02:04:39,376 --> 02:04:42,254
The 40 percent was too much, so I
found a store to make it special.

2359
02:04:42,416 --> 02:04:44,611
They take it down
another 15 percent.

2360
02:04:48,336 --> 02:04:49,689
That's killer! Killer!

2361
02:04:49,856 --> 02:04:51,050
I love that.

2362
02:04:51,816 --> 02:04:54,091
You've got to use that.
That's a definite.

2363
02:04:55,536 --> 02:04:56,730
Come on.

2364
02:04:56,896 --> 02:04:58,090
Hey!

2365
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:00,646
- Your friend here has real problems.
- Me?

2366
02:05:00,816 --> 02:05:03,205
See what he did? See how he
tried to sneak into my space?

2367
02:05:03,376 --> 02:05:04,968
Going in front-first
isn't sneaking!

2368
02:05:05,136 --> 02:05:08,094
You went in front-first
because you saw me backing up!

2369
02:05:08,256 --> 02:05:11,566
I went front-first because I can make
it front-first. Pull out! I'll show you!

2370
02:05:11,736 --> 02:05:13,454
You got a prayer.

2371
02:05:13,616 --> 02:05:15,254
I go in front-first all the time.

2372
02:05:15,416 --> 02:05:18,488
Front-first. That's how you park
when you're pulling a bank job.

2373
02:05:20,336 --> 02:05:22,054
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah.

2374
02:05:22,216 --> 02:05:25,526
- It's all taken care of.
- You told him? What did you tell him?

2375
02:05:25,696 --> 02:05:28,164
I did a number on him.

2376
02:05:28,336 --> 02:05:31,885
It was a thing of beauty. You really
had to be there to appreciate it.

2377
02:05:32,056 --> 02:05:33,535
I can't believe it.
What'd you say?

2378
02:05:33,696 --> 02:05:39,248
I told him a pack of teenagers
in a convertible were terrorizing us...

2379
02:05:39,416 --> 02:05:41,930
...and they followed us into the city.

2380
02:05:42,176 --> 02:05:43,529
A pack of teenagers?

2381
02:05:43,696 --> 02:05:45,766
Yeah. By the time
I got to the end of the story...

2382
02:05:45,936 --> 02:05:49,292
...he was so relieved we were alive,
he couldn't care less about the car.

2383
02:05:49,736 --> 02:05:52,728
You are a genius.
It's as simple as that.

2384
02:05:52,896 --> 02:05:54,488
What can I say?
You know, it's a gift.

2385
02:05:54,656 --> 02:05:58,808
I only wish I could teach you,
but, you know, it's inborn.

2386
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:02,245
By the way, thanks for inviting
me to the flea market.

2387
02:06:02,616 --> 02:06:04,811
- What?
- Yeah. Jerry, he told me all about it.

2388
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:07,445
- Great.
- I didn't know.

2389
02:06:07,936 --> 02:06:10,530
Oh, so that's why
you were acting so funny.

2390
02:06:10,696 --> 02:06:12,652
Well, I didn't know
you wanted to go.

2391
02:06:12,816 --> 02:06:15,171
A flea market?
You went to a flea market?

2392
02:06:15,336 --> 02:06:18,408
- Who's talking to you?
- We just didn't think of you.

2393
02:06:18,576 --> 02:06:21,136
- You said it, sister.
- Every time I leave my house now...

2394
02:06:21,296 --> 02:06:24,333
...I have to call everybody and ask
if they wanna do what I'm doing?

2395
02:06:24,496 --> 02:06:27,374
People forget. Look at Home Alone.
They forgot.

2396
02:06:27,536 --> 02:06:29,845
Great move telling him, by the way.
Real smart move.

2397
02:06:30,296 --> 02:06:33,015
I didn't know I wasn't supposed
to say anything.

2398
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:36,492
Judgment, Jerry, judgment.
You exercise no judgment!

2399
02:06:36,976 --> 02:06:38,329
You're right. My fault.

2400
02:06:38,496 --> 02:06:39,690
I'm sorry, Kramer.

2401
02:06:39,856 --> 02:06:41,608
I'm so sorry. Really.

2402
02:06:41,776 --> 02:06:43,528
Yeah. I'm sorry.

2403
02:06:43,696 --> 02:06:46,369
I'm sorry. I don't care for that "sorry."

2404
02:06:46,536 --> 02:06:49,255
What's wrong with that sorry?
That was a good sorry. Jerry...

2405
02:06:49,416 --> 02:06:52,453
...was that a good sorry?
- It was a so-so sorry.

2406
02:06:53,736 --> 02:06:56,250
Hey! Move this car!
I gotta get through!

2407
02:06:57,256 --> 02:06:58,769
You heard the man.

2408
02:06:59,016 --> 02:07:00,893
I guess you better be moving your car.

2409
02:07:01,056 --> 02:07:03,286
Like you're not just gonna
back it in if I do that.

2410
02:07:03,456 --> 02:07:05,890
Well, somebody better move
something soon!

2411
02:07:06,056 --> 02:07:09,093
I got a truck full of ice cream here!

2412
02:07:13,776 --> 02:07:16,495
They had to move the cars so the
truck could get through, right?

2413
02:07:16,656 --> 02:07:19,932
These guys don't trust each other,
so they got two nonpartisan drivers...

2414
02:07:20,096 --> 02:07:21,324
...to move them.

2415
02:07:26,416 --> 02:07:28,008
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?

2416
02:07:28,176 --> 02:07:29,325
Yeah.

2417
02:07:29,776 --> 02:07:33,451
Amazing how they pick you
out of everyone to terrorize.

2418
02:07:33,616 --> 02:07:37,450
Yeah. I know. I said to myself,
"Why us?" You remember?

2419
02:07:37,616 --> 02:07:40,130
Sounds like you did
some pretty nifty manoeuvring.

2420
02:07:40,296 --> 02:07:44,005
You know, it's interesting, under that
pressure, what you're capable of.

2421
02:07:44,176 --> 02:07:46,565
- Right.
- I learned a lot about myself.

2422
02:07:48,016 --> 02:07:50,052
- What did you do to my car?
- I couldn't help it!

2423
02:07:50,216 --> 02:07:52,286
Elaine moved the mirror!
I got discombobulated!

2424
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:54,174
Like you've ever been "bobulated."

2425
02:07:54,336 --> 02:07:56,167
I thought you said
you were a good driver.

2426
02:07:56,336 --> 02:07:59,328
No, I never said I was a good driver,
I said, I was a good parker.

2427
02:07:59,776 --> 02:08:01,289
I think you said driver.

2428
02:08:01,456 --> 02:08:04,175
Parker. I never said driver.
I said, parker. Great parker.

2429
02:08:04,336 --> 02:08:06,167
That's not the way it was.
Move it up.

2430
02:08:06,336 --> 02:08:08,804
- No, that's the right position.
- No, no. I was further in.

2431
02:08:08,976 --> 02:08:10,375
No, you weren't. Stop there.

2432
02:08:10,536 --> 02:08:11,855
- Do you mind?
- Do you?

2433
02:08:12,016 --> 02:08:13,608
Somebody better move these cars.

2434
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:15,767
- You're making a commotion.
- Hey, Sid.

2435
02:08:15,936 --> 02:08:18,086
- Who are you?
- Never mind who I am.

2436
02:08:18,256 --> 02:08:19,484
I know who I am.

2437
02:08:19,656 --> 02:08:20,805
Do you know who you are?

2438
02:08:21,656 --> 02:08:24,045
Why is it every time
you park a car in this block...

2439
02:08:24,216 --> 02:08:26,093
...everything gets disrupted
and disjointed?

2440
02:08:26,256 --> 02:08:28,565
- Sid, it's completely his fault.
- Right.

2441
02:08:28,736 --> 02:08:30,408
Why don't you start
taking the bus.

2442
02:08:30,576 --> 02:08:34,091
Let's go. I'm putting it in the garage.
The fight's starting in two minutes.

2443
02:08:34,256 --> 02:08:35,450
- Enough!
- No! Don't do it!

2444
02:08:35,776 --> 02:08:37,289
Are we gonna stay here all night?

2445
02:08:37,456 --> 02:08:39,811
Yes. I'm not giving him the
satisfaction. It's my space.

2446
02:08:39,976 --> 02:08:41,853
Why don't you just flip a coin, already.

2447
02:08:42,016 --> 02:08:43,574
No, this is a matter of principle.

2448
02:08:43,736 --> 02:08:47,206
That would be saying anybody can
pull into any space any way they want.

2449
02:08:47,376 --> 02:08:50,254
I'm making a stand here.
I'm saying no to headfirst parking!

2450
02:08:50,416 --> 02:08:52,805
We put up with too
much crap in this city!

2451
02:08:52,976 --> 02:08:54,887
We're not putting up
with headfirst parking!

2452
02:08:55,056 --> 02:08:58,685
Maybe if you hadn't been pontificating
about what a great parker you were...

2453
02:08:58,856 --> 02:09:00,448
...you might have got the space.

2454
02:09:01,136 --> 02:09:03,172
So you're against me now?

2455
02:09:03,336 --> 02:09:06,055
He could have pulled up
to that car and backed in...

2456
02:09:06,216 --> 02:09:07,854
...but he chose to go in headfirst.

2457
02:09:08,016 --> 02:09:11,213
No, he couldn't, because the other
car was already backing in.

2458
02:09:11,376 --> 02:09:14,413
- No, he wasn't.
- All that matters is who was there first.

2459
02:09:14,576 --> 02:09:17,374
You're not even old enough to drive,
you little puke.

2460
02:09:17,536 --> 02:09:18,730
You just spit on me!

2461
02:09:19,136 --> 02:09:21,730
Don't you raise your voice to me.

2462
02:09:21,896 --> 02:09:23,488
You're not my father!

2463
02:09:23,736 --> 02:09:24,930
Hey, Matthew.

2464
02:09:25,096 --> 02:09:26,245
Hi, Jerry.

2465
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:28,008
This guy's really a jerk.

2466
02:09:28,176 --> 02:09:30,565
- How you doing?
- Okay.

2467
02:09:30,896 --> 02:09:32,648
I hear your father's closing his store.

2468
02:09:32,816 --> 02:09:34,488
What?

2469
02:09:34,656 --> 02:09:37,045
- No. Nothing.
- What's happened to Daddy?

2470
02:09:37,216 --> 02:09:39,571
- He's going out of business?
- No, no, no.

2471
02:09:39,736 --> 02:09:41,374
We're not going to have
any money?

2472
02:09:41,536 --> 02:09:43,686
- We're out of money?
- No, of course not.

2473
02:09:43,856 --> 02:09:45,050
Mommy!

2474
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:46,968
Jerry says Daddy's closing the store.

2475
02:09:47,136 --> 02:09:49,047
He's going out of business.

2476
02:09:49,216 --> 02:09:50,888
We don't have any money?

2477
02:09:51,056 --> 02:09:53,126
Jerry, what's the matter with you?

2478
02:09:53,656 --> 02:09:54,975
I didn't...

2479
02:09:55,136 --> 02:09:56,649
I don't know about
your friend Jerry.

2480
02:09:56,816 --> 02:09:58,613
He says some stupid
things sometimes.

2481
02:09:58,776 --> 02:10:00,095
Yeah.

2482
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:04,006
- Congratulations.
- What for?

2483
02:10:04,176 --> 02:10:05,734
Well, you're pregnant.

2484
02:10:05,896 --> 02:10:08,091
- What?
- You're not pregnant?

2485
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:09,735
No, I'm not pregnant.

2486
02:10:10,536 --> 02:10:13,733
- Are you sure you're not pregnant?
- Yes, I'm sure!

2487
02:10:14,416 --> 02:10:15,815
- That's weird.
- Come on, Matthew.

2488
02:10:15,976 --> 02:10:17,648
- No!
- Come on, Matthew!

2489
02:10:18,416 --> 02:10:20,008
I thought she was pregnant.

2490
02:10:20,776 --> 02:10:22,255
Hey, do you think I'm a phoney?

2491
02:10:22,416 --> 02:10:24,134
- What?
- Mike thinks I'm a phoney.

2492
02:10:24,296 --> 02:10:26,605
- He thinks you're a phoney?
- But I can't say anything...

2493
02:10:26,776 --> 02:10:29,609
...because I'm not supposed to know.
- You have to say something.

2494
02:10:29,776 --> 02:10:31,528
I can't. I told Kramer
I was vaulting it.

2495
02:10:31,696 --> 02:10:33,687
- You gotta open the vault.
- Open my vault?!

2496
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:35,847
- Open your vault.
- Once I open the vault...

2497
02:10:36,016 --> 02:10:38,211
...it ceases to be a vault.
- You have no choice.

2498
02:10:38,496 --> 02:10:40,168
The vault.

2499
02:10:40,656 --> 02:10:43,295
You know why you can't go
in front-first? I'll tell you why.

2500
02:10:43,456 --> 02:10:46,095
Because it signals a breakdown
in the social order.

2501
02:10:46,256 --> 02:10:49,771
Chaos! It reduces us to jungle law.

2502
02:10:51,016 --> 02:10:52,529
When can you park headfirst?

2503
02:10:52,696 --> 02:10:53,924
Never.

2504
02:10:54,096 --> 02:10:56,087
- Why are you asking him?
- Who's talking to you?

2505
02:10:56,256 --> 02:10:58,372
He's right! Never!

2506
02:10:58,536 --> 02:11:00,333
What if you got 10 car lengths?

2507
02:11:00,496 --> 02:11:02,691
Should you pull all the
way to the front car?

2508
02:11:02,856 --> 02:11:04,289
If you got 10 car lengths...

2509
02:11:04,456 --> 02:11:06,094
When do you ever have
10 car lengths?

2510
02:11:06,256 --> 02:11:07,689
What about Sundays
and holidays?

2511
02:11:07,856 --> 02:11:09,608
Please.

2512
02:11:09,776 --> 02:11:11,368
What's going on here?

2513
02:11:11,536 --> 02:11:14,414
This guy tried to sneak
into my space.

2514
02:11:14,576 --> 02:11:18,251
I really hate people who do that. I hope
you don't let him get away with it.

2515
02:11:18,896 --> 02:11:20,648
Thank you for your support.

2516
02:11:21,056 --> 02:11:23,092
Hey, that's a great hat.

2517
02:11:23,256 --> 02:11:24,928
Really? You like it?

2518
02:11:25,616 --> 02:11:27,049
I got it at a flea market today.

2519
02:11:27,216 --> 02:11:29,286
- Hey, George, nice hat.
- Yeah, thanks.

2520
02:11:29,456 --> 02:11:31,287
- Can I try it on?
- No! It wouldn't fit you.

2521
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:33,367
- Sure, it would.
- No! Get out of here, Newman.

2522
02:11:33,536 --> 02:11:35,049
- Let me try it.
- No! Stop it!

2523
02:11:35,216 --> 02:11:37,127
- Let him try it on.
- I don't want him to!

2524
02:11:37,376 --> 02:11:39,128
What is wrong with you?

2525
02:11:39,576 --> 02:11:42,807
You want to see? There!
There it is! Run!

2526
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:45,331
All right! You wanna try on the hat?!
Try on the hat!

2527
02:11:45,496 --> 02:11:47,851
Stop it, George! Stop it.
I was defending your parking.

2528
02:11:48,016 --> 02:11:50,086
- Come on, George!
- Okay, just keep the hat!

2529
02:11:50,256 --> 02:11:52,850
That's it. The fight's already started.
I'm going upstairs.

2530
02:11:53,016 --> 02:11:55,576
- Who's coming? Elaine?
- Depends on who's going. You going?

2531
02:11:55,736 --> 02:11:57,806
- I'm not going if he's going!
- Me either!

2532
02:11:57,976 --> 02:12:00,126
- Well, I'm going.
- lf he's going, I'm not going!

2533
02:12:00,296 --> 02:12:01,888
- It's your house!
- I don't have to go.

2534
02:12:02,056 --> 02:12:04,411
- I won't go if Jerry's not.
- Why won't you go if I go?

2535
02:12:04,576 --> 02:12:06,567
Why? I'll tell you why.

2536
02:12:06,736 --> 02:12:09,773
- No. Don't, Jerry.
- Like you didn't call me a phoney!

2537
02:12:09,936 --> 02:12:11,255
What?

2538
02:12:11,416 --> 02:12:13,134
- Thanks! Real good!
- All right.

2539
02:12:13,296 --> 02:12:14,570
Jerry.

2540
02:12:15,056 --> 02:12:17,286
I think you completely
misunderstood what I said.

2541
02:12:17,456 --> 02:12:19,014
I meant it in a complimentary way.

2542
02:12:19,416 --> 02:12:22,488
You know, when people say, " He's
bad," it really means, " He's good."

2543
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,055
That sort of thing?

2544
02:12:24,216 --> 02:12:27,174
- You know, slang.
- Use it in a sentence.

2545
02:12:27,336 --> 02:12:30,646
Man, that Michael Jordan
is so phoney.

2546
02:12:30,976 --> 02:12:32,204
Why did you tell him?!

2547
02:12:32,376 --> 02:12:35,448
- He begged me!
- He begged you?!

2548
02:12:35,616 --> 02:12:37,766
Come on, who wants
to watch the fight?

2549
02:12:37,936 --> 02:12:40,814
Okay, whose cars are these?
Let's move them. Let's go.

2550
02:12:40,976 --> 02:12:42,773
Officer, can I explain
something to you?

2551
02:12:42,936 --> 02:12:46,246
Let's go, or I'm gonna write both
of you a ticket in about two minutes.

2552
02:12:46,416 --> 02:12:48,168
He can't pull in headfirst!

2553
02:12:48,336 --> 02:12:50,213
Officer, he backed up
from down the street!

2554
02:12:50,376 --> 02:12:52,287
He was double-parked!
He was sitting there!

2555
02:12:53,616 --> 02:12:57,325
All right, you move your car. It's his
space. You can't go in headfirst.

2556
02:12:59,656 --> 02:13:00,975
Wait a second.

2557
02:13:01,616 --> 02:13:03,174
Why can't he go in headfirst?

2558
02:13:03,536 --> 02:13:05,447
He said the guy
was just sitting over there.

2559
02:13:05,816 --> 02:13:08,091
What are you talking about?
This guy was here first.

2560
02:13:08,256 --> 02:13:10,816
- But he didn't take it.
- Hey! It's his space!

2561
02:13:10,976 --> 02:13:12,773
No, it's his space!

2562
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:15,528
You're gonna have to go
to the bathroom!

2563
02:13:15,696 --> 02:13:17,766
- You'll have to go to work!
- I don't have a job!

2564
02:13:17,936 --> 02:13:19,972
Neither do I!

2565
02:13:25,776 --> 02:13:27,175
Seven.

2566
02:13:27,616 --> 02:13:28,890
Eight.

2567
02:13:29,576 --> 02:13:31,168
Nine.

2568
02:13:31,576 --> 02:13:33,248
Ten.

2569
02:13:36,656 --> 02:13:39,648
People will kill each other
for a parking space in New York.

2570
02:13:39,816 --> 02:13:43,365
Because they think, " If I don't get
this one, I may never get a space."

2571
02:13:43,776 --> 02:13:47,689
You know. " I'll circle for months until
somebody goes out to the Hamptons."

2572
02:13:48,336 --> 02:13:52,409
Everybody in New York City knows
there's gotta be way more cars...

2573
02:13:52,576 --> 02:13:53,804
...than parking spaces.

2574
02:13:53,976 --> 02:13:57,013
You see cars driving in New York
all hours of the night.

2575
02:13:57,176 --> 02:14:01,328
It's like musical chairs, except
everybody sat down around 1964.

2576
02:14:01,976 --> 02:14:05,730
The problem is, car manufacturers
are building hundreds of thousands...

2577
02:14:05,896 --> 02:14:07,011
...of new cars every year.

2578
02:14:07,176 --> 02:14:09,610
They're not making any new spaces.

2579
02:14:09,776 --> 02:14:12,131
That's what they should work on.
Wouldn't that be great?

2580
02:14:12,296 --> 02:14:15,049
You go to the auto show,
they got that big revolving turntable...
