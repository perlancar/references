1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,066
How about the scam the airlines
have with these special clubs?

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,737
One hundred fifty dollars a year
to sit in a room...

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:12,400
...eat peanuts, drink coffee and soda
and read magazines.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,309
Excuse me, isn't this the flight?

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,349
I already got four hours of this
coming to me.

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,452
What am I paying for?

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,315
How about an
l-got-all-my-luggage club?

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,720
Can I get into that? Where's that club?
I would like to join that club.

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,023
Airlines love to divide us up
into classes, you know?

10
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,596
When you're sitting in coach...

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:36,167
...they always have the stewardess
close that stupid curtain, you know?

12
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,633
They give you that look like:

13
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,238
"Maybe if you had worked
a little harder..."

14
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,168
What time does your flight get in?

15
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,576
Six? All right,
that gives us six hours.

16
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,739
Then I'll meet you
at the Diplomat's Club.

17
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,942
I'll be the one without
the big red sash.

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,950
Okay. See you tonight.

19
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,557
- Is that the supermodel?
- Yep.

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,489
She's not gonna be back
for a month, but I have six hours.

21
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,219
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,261
I do, but it's 3:00.
I'm flying right back.

23
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,866
Then I'm gonna meet Bridgette
at the Diplomat's Club.

24
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,501
Well, guess what I'm doing.

25
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:14,732
I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am
telling him that I am quitting.

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,904
So that's it?

27
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,738
You know, I never even met the guy.

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,176
I've had enough. I am marching in.

29
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,338
- You're marching in?
- I'm marching.

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,584
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey, Elaine's quitting.

31
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,914
- Really?
- I'm marching in.

32
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,784
I've done the march in.
Best feeling.

33
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,721
- How about the march out?
- Not as good.

34
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,827
You realize all the money
you're losing.

35
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,753
Oh, boy. Okay, that's it.

36
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,763
- Wish me luck.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,128
Get a march going.

38
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,102
March it.

39
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,431
- Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
- Why?

40
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,541
Well, I wanna put a picture of me
and my boss up in the office.

41
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,937
What for?

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,102
Well, he's reorganizing
the whole staff...

43
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,270
...and I'm on thin ice
with this guy as it is.

44
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,975
Isn't putting his picture on your desk
a little transparent?

45
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,847
It better be.

46
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,294
- Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
- One second, Elaine.

47
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,294
- Mr. Pitt...
- Elaine.

48
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,864
Do you know what I just did?

49
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,696
I just amended my will
to include you as a beneficiary.

50
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,460
What?

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,470
Well, I think of you
as part of my family.

52
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,370
You've come to be like
a daughter to me.

53
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,637
I want to make sure that you're
taken care of after I'm gone.

54
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,646
Mr. Pitt.

55
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,515
I feel a cold coming on.
Could you get me a cold pill?

56
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,053
Oh, no, Mr. Pitt, you mustrt.

57
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,488
You have to check before you combine
anything with your heart medicine.

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,821
Yes, yes. I'll check with
the pharmacist.

59
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,191
We don't want anything
to happen to you, Mr. Pitt.

60
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,993
We want you to live
a long, long time.

61
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,734
Look at that,
I only got one picture left.

62
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,068
How about a shot of me
and Mr. Morgan?

63
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,169
- Why?
- Why?

64
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,174
Because we're a team. Come on.

65
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,781
Would you take this for us, dear?
Thank you very much. Here we go.

66
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,345
Anyone ever tell you you look
a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard?

67
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,489
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you must hear that all the time.

68
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,785
I suppose we all look alike
to you, right, Costanza?

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,861
What? What? No, no, no.

70
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,898
No, no, it's not a racial thing.
There really is a resemblance.

71
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,633
Don't you think
he looks like Sugar Ray?

72
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,431
Come on, somebody.
Back me up.

73
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,867
Come on. A little help.

74
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,405
Maybe he looks a little like
Sugar Ray Leonard.

75
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,516
A little? Come on.

76
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,379
Well, you still shouldn't
have said it.

77
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,747
You think Morgan thinks
I have a racial bias?

78
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,388
Maybe.

79
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,080
Boy, that is so unfair.

80
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,886
I would've marched on Selma
if it was in Long Island.

81
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,122
- You'd have marched on Great Neck?
- Absolutely. I still might.

82
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,994
I always hated those girls.
They would never date me.

83
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,493
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

84
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,103
- So you ready?
- For what?

85
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,570
He's taking me to the airport.
We got a few minutes.

86
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,003
Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,609
What, you got no luggage?

88
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,972
This is it.
I'm only going for the day.

89
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,876
- I just gotta pick up a toothbrush.
- Okay.

90
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,847
Hey, Kramer.
Who does that look like?

91
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,785
- I don't know.
- Come on, come on.

92
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:22,257
- Not salt, but...?
- What, Pepper Johnson?

93
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,822
No. Sugar Ray Leonard.

94
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,466
Oh, no way.

95
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,065
All right, I'll tell you what.

96
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,100
I'll bet you the next
three people I ask...

97
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,262
...two of them will say Sugar Ray.

98
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,339
How much? $ 100? $200? $ 1000?

99
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,499
Wait, what are you doing?
You're not betting.

100
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,578
- You know he's not supposed to bet.
- Come on, Jerry, it's a lock.

101
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,738
Kramer, you've had this thing
under control...

102
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,145
...for almost three years now.
Don't start again.

103
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,446
- But it's a lock, Jerry.
- No.

104
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,456
- What're you doing about Morgan?
- You know what would be great?

105
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,788
If he could see me with
some of my black friends.

106
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,022
Except you don't really
have any black friends.

107
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,666
Outside of us, you don't
have any white friends either.

108
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,565
- Yes?
- Hello, Joe?

109
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,173
- Who is this?
- It's me.

110
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,300
- George Costanza.
- Who?

111
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,708
Remember I was here a while back?

112
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,872
We watched
Breakfast at Tiffany's together?

113
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,142
What do you want?

114
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,814
Well, I've rented another video, Joe.

115
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,614
And there's some popcorn.

116
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,020
- I thought we could do it again.
- Go away.

117
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,658
Remy. Hi.

118
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,353
You. What are you doing here?

119
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,328
Well, I got another
Audrey Hepburn movie.

120
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,229
- Remy, is that you?
- Daddy, that mars here again.

121
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,996
Remy, I want you up here instantly.

122
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,608
You know, Remy, I was thinking.
Last time we were together, you...

123
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,509
That's great.

124
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,415
You know what? Leave it.
Just pull the car around front.

125
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,283
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'll take care of it.

126
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,925
Just throw that in there, would you?

127
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,458
Excuse me.

128
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,691
I take heart medication. What would
you recommend for a runny nose?

129
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,859
Take an antihistamine.
They're over there.

130
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,062
- It's all right to take?
- Yeah, they're great.

131
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,374
What about appetite suppressants?

132
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,031
I just saw them.

133
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,337
Oh, here. Here you go.

134
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,413
- Thank you, young man.
- Have a good day, sir.

135
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,741
- This is your swanky Diplomat's Club.
- I don't see Katie anywhere.

136
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,554
What's this, a fellow club member?

137
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,521
No, she's this woman who's
booking me on these college tours.

138
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,355
She thinks I'm some big celebrity
that has to be pampered...

139
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,121
...and explained every little thing.

140
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,562
Yeah. I'm gonna get some snacks
before my flight.

141
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,295
- Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Katie.

142
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,441
- You found the airport all right?
- Yes, I followed the planes.

143
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,702
I see you're having coffee.

144
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,073
Just so you know,
they also have decaf as well.

145
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,580
And I talked to the hostess, they'll also
be serving coffee on the plane...

146
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,082
...along with a selection
of cocktails and soft...

147
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,517
Thanks. Thanks for telling me.

148
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,515
What's going on?

149
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,854
I'm Lenore Walker,
Mr. Pitt's estate lawyer.

150
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,795
I arrived to discuss his will and found
Justin had collapsed on the floor.

151
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,058
Oh, my God.

152
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,067
- Who are you?
- This is the girl I want to put in my will.

153
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,434
- Elaine, l...
- Please. Rest, Mr. Pitt.

154
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,438
Oh, you're the assistant.

155
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,543
Why werert you here
taking care of him?

156
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:31,306
Well, he gave me the morning off.
I was doing a little shopping.

157
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,616
How did this happen?

158
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,184
He took a very dangerous combination
of prescription heart medicine...

159
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,948
...and these other pills.

160
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,183
You were supposed
to talk to the pharmacist.

161
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,988
I spoke to somebody
who worked there.

162
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,132
Oh, I'm gonna go
and call that pharmacy.

163
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,461
How well do you know her?

164
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,263
Jerry, just so you know,
before we take off...

165
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,636
...they'll tell us what to do
in event of a crash.

166
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,037
Yes, I know. I've flown before.

167
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,443
Oh, good. I just didn't
want you to freak out.

168
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,276
The chance of a crash is very slim.

169
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,010
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No.

170
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,323
Even if you have to go a little,
you better go now...

171
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,393
...because you can't until
after takeoff.

172
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,235
- Hey, how you doing?
- Pretty good.

173
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,661
Name's Kramer.

174
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,302
Earl Haffler. Nice to meet you.

175
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,237
I'm headed to Houston.
Where you headed?

176
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,041
Oh, I'm happy right here.

177
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,706
Isn't this place amazing?

178
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,713
Planes flying in
from all corners of the world...

179
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,317
...and they know the minute
when they're arriving.

180
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,919
Oh, they don't know a darn thing.

181
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,283
That's why my flight to Houston
has been delayed.

182
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,118
They're all morons.

183
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,385
Matter of fact, I'll bet you...

184
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,962
...that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off
before my flight to Houston.

185
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,155
Bet?

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,691
- Not a betting man.
- Friendly wager.

187
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,269
- I haven't made a bet in three years.
- Oh, come on.

188
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,599
Keep things interesting,
pass the time.

189
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,303
- Okay, how much?
- How about 200.

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,573
You're on, cowboy.

191
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,114
- How you doing?
- Okay.

192
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,284
- Nice day today.
- What?

193
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,553
I'm George, George Costanza.
You live around here?

194
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,928
Now arriving at gate 12...

195
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,832
- This could be Mexico City.
- Come on, Seattle, let's go.

196
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,441
- Come on, Mexico City!
- Seattle! Seattle!

197
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,339
Flight number 42 from Mexico City.

198
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,942
Yeah, buddy.

199
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,847
All right, come on, let's go again.
Let's go again.

200
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,346
Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?

201
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,114
No.

202
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,485
You need to sit up.
Why don't I get you a pillow.

203
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,184
Okay.

204
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,444
It's a pretty full house,
lighting guy's name is Lou.

205
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,378
- He's got a birthday next week.
- Yeah, I don't care.

206
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,484
By the way, I don't want you
to freak out...

207
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,779
...but the pilot is going to be
in the audience.

208
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,312
Who?

209
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,922
Remember the plane we took here?

210
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,855
The pilot is going to be
sitting out there watching the show.

211
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,552
I don't care.
Why are you telling me this?

212
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,527
I just didn't want you to freak out.

213
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,166
Why would I freak out?

214
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,527
Pilot.

215
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:42,538
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
a big hand for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.

216
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,873
Hey!

217
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,482
All right. Good afternoon, Ithaca.
Welcome.

218
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,014
Good to see you here.

219
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,653
Boy, I noticed there's a lot
of those orange cones...

220
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,755
...you have out on the thruway
on the way...

221
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,749
...up here.

222
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,662
I was... l...

223
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,172
- It didn't go very well, did it?
- No, it didn't.

224
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,407
And you know why?

225
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,381
Seeing that pilot in the audience
really freaked me out.

226
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,713
I knew it.

227
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,914
If you hadrt mentioned anything,
I would've been fine.

228
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,524
I became obsessed with him.

229
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,285
Why did I invite him?
Stupid. Stupid.

230
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,520
When he asked for tickets,
I should've said no.

231
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,564
- I'm gonna go chew him out.
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.

232
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,634
- Don't you worry, I'm on top of this.
- Yeah, you're on top of it.

233
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,703
And I'm on the bottom!

234
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:53,037
Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like
you're in the hole $3200.

235
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,009
Will that be cash or check?

236
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,479
Come on, one more bet.
Double or nothing, huh?

237
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,146
All right.

238
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,219
But I wanna see
some cash on the table.

239
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,889
All right, let me call my bank, huh?

240
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,820
All right, you stay here.

241
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,432
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

242
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,298
Hey, what's up?

243
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,132
All right, listen,
I need some cash.

244
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,298
- What for?
- I just need it, that's all.

245
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,070
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

246
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,770
You're gambling again, aren't you?

247
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,439
You weak, weak man.

248
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,915
- Where are you?
- I'm at the airport.

249
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,146
- The airport?
- Betting on arrivals and departures.

250
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,814
But I'm down 3200 bucks,
so you gotta get me some cash.

251
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,483
- I don't have that kind of dough.
- Sure you do.

252
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,526
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not the bag.

253
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,324
Help me, man. I'm desperate.

254
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,100
All right, all right.

255
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,900
Sorry for the delay, folks.

256
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,097
There is a slight complication,
but we're taking care of it...

257
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,242
...and we'll be on our way
to LaGuardia.

258
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,637
What is the complication?

259
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,379
- Mr. Seinfeld?
- Yes?

260
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,711
I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked
that you leave this plane.

261
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,875
What?

262
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,851
Apparently he has
some sort of problem with you.

263
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,719
I'm not surprised.
I really let him have it, Jerry.

264
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,057
He had no business being in your
audience if you didn't want him there.

265
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,492
I didn't care.

266
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,964
Well, now the pilot doesn't
want you on his plane.

267
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,830
He can't just throw me
off the plane.

268
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,906
Yes, he can, if he has cause to believe
that a passenger will be a disturbance.

269
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,042
But I'm not a disturbance.

270
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,701
Well, apparently you are
disturbing him, sir.

271
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,870
But someone is waiting for me.

272
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,573
- Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
- I'm freaking out!

273
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,242
I am freaking out!

274
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,659
There's a flight leaving at 8
and another one leaving at 8:30.

275
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,093
Which one do you want?

276
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,428
Which one do you think I want?

277
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,566
- The 8 will get you in a little earlier.
- Then we'll make it the 8.

278
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,470
Okay, I'll book a hotel.
A standard room or a mini-suite?

279
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,406
- Hotel?
- Yeah, it's 8 in the morning.

280
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,308
No, no, I have to get home tonight.

281
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,280
Bridgette's gonna be waiting for me
at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.

282
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,181
Midsize, luxury or sports model?
What's your preference?

283
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:24,194
I don't have a preference, okay?
Just make a decision yourself.

284
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,560
All right? Stop bothering me
with every minor detail.

285
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,257
Please?

286
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,933
Okay. You're the big celebrity.

287
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,237
- Hello?
- George.

288
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,813
- Hey, Jerry. How was Ithaca?
- I'm still here.

289
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,042
You gotta go down
to the Diplomat's Club...

290
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,686
Hey, Jerry, what was the name
of that exterminator...

291
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,186
...who fumigated your apartment
when you had fleas?

292
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,190
- Karl, I think.
- Karl. Yeah, yeah.

293
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,328
- He was a nice guy.
- Yeah, he was nice.

294
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,963
- What company was it?
- Defend.

295
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,326
Defend. Yeah.
You know, we spoke for a little bit.

296
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,162
- You need an exterminator?
- No, not really.

297
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,735
Oh, don't tell me.

298
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,738
- Because he's black?
- Gotta go.

299
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,172
George? George?

300
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,107
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
Is Elaine there?

301
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,804
Hold on.

302
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,115
Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld
on the phone for you.

303
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,350
- Hello?
- Elaine. I need a big favor.

304
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:31,121
Go down to the Diplomat's Club
and meet Bridgette for me. I'm late.

305
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,958
- That's at the airport, right?
- Right.

306
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,158
She'll think I stood her up.
I'll never get another date with her.

307
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,132
- She'll freak out!
- All right, all right.

308
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,762
- You sound a little freaked out yourself.
- I am a little freaked out!

309
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,568
Calm down. I'll take care of it.

310
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,836
- All right, but you have to leave now!
- I said, I'll take care of it.

311
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,744
- Kramer.
- Hey.

312
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,480
- Okay, here it is.
- All right, good.

313
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,853
Here's my collateral.

314
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,124
So it's a mailbag. So what?

315
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,523
So what?

316
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,131
Do you know whose
mailbag that is?

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,831
David Berkowitz.

318
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,366
Son of Sam.

319
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,029
The worst mass murderer
the post office ever produced.

320
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,267
- Where'd you get this?
- I took over his route.

321
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,436
And, boy, were there a lot
of dogs on that route.

322
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,611
- Any of them talking to you?
- Just to tell me to keep off the snacks.

323
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:35,092
- Your bud is a hell of a guy.
- Yeah, don't I know it.

324
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,660
Okay, Cosmo,
we're back in business.

325
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,819
Yeah.

326
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,229
Let's check out the board.
Now, who do you like?

327
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,369
All right, how about Ithaca
versus Boston?

328
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,838
All right. I'm gonna give you
a sporting chance. I'll take Ithaca.

329
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,067
- Double or nothing.
- Double or nothing.

330
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,074
I hope you know what you're doing.

331
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,787
- Where are we?
- I'm not sure.

332
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:10,428
- Is this even a road?
- Oh, we lost the road half-hour ago.

333
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,257
What? Well, why didn't you
wake me up?

334
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,865
You told me not to bother you
with minor details.

335
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,630
- No road is a major detail.
- Okay, now I know.

336
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,501
Should I keep going or turn around?
Do you have a preference?

337
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,608
Look out!

338
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,881
- May I help you?
- I'm the exterminator.

339
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,519
Oh, yes, of course. Come in.

340
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,519
Why didn't you want me to bring
my equipment or wear my uniform?

341
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,920
Well, if the other people in the office
saw that I had called an exterminator...

342
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,686
...they would just panic.

343
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,761
They're a jittery group.

344
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,058
Besides, this is sort of
a friendly visit.

345
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,497
- Karl, right?
- Do I know you?

346
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,660
Yeah. We met at
Jerry Seinfeld's apartment...

347
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,102
...when you fumigated for fleas
over there.

348
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,607
Seinfeld. Oh, yeah.
Funny white guy, right?

349
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,939
Jerry?

350
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,244
Yes, I suppose he is white.
I never really thought about it.

351
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:09,678
I don't really see people
in terms of color.

352
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,488
You know, there's someone I'd like
you to meet. Hang on a second.

353
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,993
- Is Mr. Morgan in?
- Mr. Morgan left for dinner.

354
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,926
He left?

355
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,234
Karl, you hungry?

356
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,840
Here's a new twist on car-pooling:

357
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:29,996
Early this morning...

358
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,973
...a lost Manattanite drove through
a residential back yard...

359
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,705
...and wound up in a swimming pool
near Ithaca, New York.

360
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,940
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld,
a passenger...

361
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,846
...seemed a little freaked out.

362
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,385
That's it! No more questions!
I don't care!

363
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,023
No! No! No!

364
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,957
That's him. That's the man who
gave me the pills in the drugstore.

365
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,619
He's no pharmacist.

366
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,296
Seinfeld? I know that name.

367
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,459
He called here earlier for Elaine.

368
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,146
Oh, by the way, order anything
you want, it's all on me.

369
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,213
Just do me a tiny favor.

370
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,816
Pretend we're old friends.

371
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,183
Oh, my God, Mr. Morgan.
What a coincidence.

372
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,756
It's Mr. Morgan. Come here.

373
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:24,055
Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet
a dear old friend of mine, Karl.

374
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,129
I'm the exterminator.

375
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:30,765
That's what we used to call him in
high school, "The Exterminator."

376
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,995
He was a linebacker. Oh, boy.

377
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,903
Oh, did we have some wild times.

378
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,978
Well, that Newman
was your good-luck charm.

379
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,775
- Yeah, he sure was.
- I should've quit at double or nothing.

380
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,680
- Traveler's checks acceptable?
- Oh, I accept.

381
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,413
Yeah, he worked in the cubicle
right next to me.

382
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,250
We once double-dated.

383
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,220
Yeah.

384
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,591
It's a pleasure doing business
with a gentleman like yourself.

385
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,466
- Kramer.
- Elaine, what are you doing here?

386
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,499
Jerry asked me
to meet his girlfriend here.

387
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,297
You hear about his plane in Ithaca?

388
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,938
What about the plane in Ithaca?

389
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,701
Our stupid friend
freaked out the pilot...

390
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,243
...single-handedly delayed
the plane a whole hour.

391
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,971
- Can you believe that?
- Boy.

392
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,140
Your friend caused the delay?

393
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,616
- You're a cheat.
- No, wait...

394
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,553
- Nobody hustles Earl Haffler.
- Oh, come on.

395
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,557
- See you around, Cosmo.
- What?

396
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,819
Howdy, ma'am.

397
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,601
Poison you?

398
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,926
Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you?

399
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,334
What? What?
Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious?

400
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,168
He's never even met you.

401
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,744
You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.

402
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,740
Goodbye?

403
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,642
- Bridgette.
- Jerry, what happened?

404
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,014
I'm so sorry.
I got stuck out of town.

405
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,652
I missed our whole time together.

406
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,311
Well, my plane doesn't leave
for another half-hour.

407
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,479
Really?

408
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,071
Oh, my God. It's him.

409
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,672
It's the pilot!

410
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,561
I love this place. You know,
Karl and I come here all the time.

411
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,459
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I come here all the time.

412
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,430
You wouldn't believe
the rat droppings in the kitchen.

413
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,903
So you really are an exterminator?

414
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,836
This time, George,
you've sunk to a new low.

415
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,403
Check, please.

416
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,411
Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard
can eat here on the house.

417
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,074
Hear that? Hear that? Mr. Morgan!

418
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,413
Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
