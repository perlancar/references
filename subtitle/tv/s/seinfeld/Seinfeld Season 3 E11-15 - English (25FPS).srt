1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,002
Every mall has a Hoffritz in it.

2
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:08,322
That's got to be a scary place
to work. I don't know how you feel.

3
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,445
Do you want to stand there
having people going:

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,043
"I need knives.
I need more knives.

5
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,120
Do you have any bigger knives?

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,757
I'd like a bigger knife.
A big, long, sharp knife.

7
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:20,489
That's what I'm in the market for.
I like them really sharp.

8
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,480
Do you have one
with hooks and gouges...

9
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,288
...and blades
that are kind of serrated?

10
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,917
That's the kind of knife
I'm looking for.

11
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,723
I need one I can throw.
I need one I can hack away with.

12
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:33,039
Do you have anything like that?"

13
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:44,321
Like you know
what you're talking about.

14
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:45,683
Oh, no. You do?

15
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:48,968
Well, what do you think,
they put the statue on a giant raft...

16
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,007
...and a tugboat pulled it
all the way from France?

17
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:55,202
Think they brought it in pieces...

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,008
...and screwed it together
like a coffee table?

19
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:00,967
What's going on? It's a little early
for a Christmas party.

20
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,768
- Why'd France give that to us anyway?
- It was a gift.

21
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,601
Countries just exchange gifts
like that?

22
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,839
If they like each other.

23
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:10,359
- There's Elaine.
- See that guy she's talking with?

24
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,759
- That's her new boyfriend.
- Really?

25
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:14,681
He works here in the office?

26
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,602
They're having a little fling,
so don't say anything to anyone.

27
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,246
Who am I gonna tell, my mother?
Like I have nothing better to talk about.

28
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,081
You don't.

29
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:27,041
He's a recovering alcoholic.

30
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,207
- Really?
- He's been off the wagon two years.

31
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:33,208
- "Off the wagon"?
- I think it's "off the wagon."

32
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:36,000
I think it's "on the wagon."

33
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:39,206
Jerry, George,
what are you doing here?

34
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,121
What am I doing here?

35
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,642
My God! My watch!
You found my watch.

36
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:49,164
Keep your hands to yourself
if you know what's good for you.

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,525
- Where'd you find it?
- Under the sofa cushion.

38
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:55,284
- You stopped by just to give it to me?
- It's your Christmas present.

39
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,768
- I thought I'd never find it.
- Today's your lucky day.

40
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,880
No, today is your lucky day.

41
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,882
- It would be my first one.
- You want to work here?

42
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,005
- What?
- Yeah. One of the readers just left.

43
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,080
There's a job opening.

44
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:11,001
Dick, this is Jerry.
And this is George.

45
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:13,399
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Is this the guy?

46
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,407
"The guy"?

47
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:19,645
- Dick.
- How can you just get it?

48
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,640
My boss said to find someone.
I'm in charge.

49
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,765
All you have to do is meet him.
Come on.

50
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,920
- No, come on. Hold my drink.
- Cranberry juice?

51
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,398
And vodka. Come on.

52
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,518
I got the cranberry juice.

53
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,001
So...

54
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:36,524
...you're Jerry.
- So...

55
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,441
...l'm Jerry.

56
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:41,160
So have you ever done
this kind of work before?

57
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:46,441
Well, you know, book reports,
that kind of stuff.

58
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,128
- Who do you read?
- I like Mike Lupica.

59
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:55,722
Mike Lupica?

60
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,562
He's a sportswriter
for the Daily News.

61
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:01,687
- I find him very insightful.
- No, I mean authors.

62
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:06,727
Well...

63
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:10,404
...a lot of good ones.
Lot of good ones.

64
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,082
I don't even wanna
mention anybody...

65
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:14,558
...because I'm afraid I'm gonna
leave somebody out.

66
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,959
- Name a couple.
- Who do I like?

67
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:22,080
I like Art Vandalay.

68
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,201
- Art Vandalay?
- He's an obscure writer.

69
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:29,088
Beatnik, you know, from the village.

70
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,882
What's he written?

71
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,880
Venetian Blinds.

72
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,521
I got news for you.
I'm funnier than you are.

73
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:39,157
Why don't we get together New Year's,
watch some football?

74
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,718
- Where's my drink?
- There. So how'd it go?

75
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,720
I think he's impressed.

76
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,560
No, no, this is just cranberry juice.

77
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:54,080
I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

78
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:56,162
Dick?

79
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:00,562
He can't drink. He's an alcoholic.
I told you to hold it.

80
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:03,482
I didn't know you meant hold it.
I thought you meant hold it.

81
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,689
One drink like that,
and he could fall right off the wagon.

82
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,282
Told you.

83
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,564
I never feel comfortable
in the women's department.

84
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,404
I feel like I'm just a little too close
to trying on a dress.

85
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,641
Do I really have to
buy her something?

86
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:26,484
The woman got you a job.
Least you could do is buy her a gift.

87
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,162
How about this?

88
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:31,127
- What is that, cashmere?
- Yeah. She loves cashmere.

89
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,642
Who doesn't like cashmere?

90
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,642
Find me one person that doesn't
like cashmere. It's too expensive.

91
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:39,325
Wow, look at this.
It's $85, marked down from 600.

92
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,877
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes.

93
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,165
How come this sweater's only $85?

94
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:47,524
Oh, here. This is why.

95
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,962
- What? I don't see anything.
- See this red dot?

96
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,881
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, it's damaged.

97
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,005
It's not really damaged.

98
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,761
Wow. $85?

99
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,363
There's no exchanges on this.

100
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,164
- Think she'd care about the dot?
- It's hard to say.

101
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,160
I don't think she'd notice.
Can you see it?

102
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,320
- Well, I can see it.
- But you know where it is.

103
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:10,562
- What do you want me to do, not look?
- Pretend you didn't know it was there.

104
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,481
- Can you see it?
- It's hard to pretend...

105
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:15,527
...because I know where it is.
- Can't you take an overview?

106
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,088
You want me to take an overview?

107
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,841
I see a cheap man
holding a sweater...

108
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,206
...trying to get away with something.
That's my overview.

109
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:29,282
- Yeah, so?
- He's acting very strangely.

110
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,599
I think he started drinking again.

111
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,329
- Oh, boy. Can you smell it?
- No, I can't smell it.

112
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,764
If you can't smell it,
then he hasn't been drinking.

113
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:39,682
- You don't always smell from a drink.
- Yes, you do.

114
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,363
What about one drink?
Would you smell from one drink?

115
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,201
Yes, you would.

116
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:48,277
- I'll prove it.
- How?

117
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,167
- Would you do me a favour?
- Okay.

118
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,718
Would you take a drink,
and let us smell you?

119
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,168
You can smell me without the drink.

120
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:58,846
No, no.

121
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,357
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing
might be drinking, but I can't smell it.

122
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,963
- Come on.
- Okay. Well, what am I drinking?

123
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:09,121
I got a bottle of Scotch my uncle
gave me. Hennigan's.

124
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:12,167
It's been there two years.
I've been using it as a paint thinner.

125
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:18,842
All right.

126
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:27,406
- I don't smell anything.
- We're too close to the bottle.

127
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,363
- Yeah?
- It's George.

128
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,919
- Come on up.
- That is damn good Scotch.

129
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,517
I could do a commercial
for this stuff.

130
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:44,367
Boy, that Hennigan
goes down smooth...

131
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,477
...and afterwards,
you don't even smell.

132
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,358
That's right, folks. I just had three
shots of Hennigan's, and I don't smell.

133
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,763
Imagine, you can walk around
drunk all day.

134
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,604
That's Hennigan's,
the no-smell, no-tell Scotch.

135
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,602
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey, George, come here.

136
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:06,203
I'm gonna tell you what I think.

137
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,883
I know you don't care what I think,
but I'm gonna tell you.

138
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,645
I think that you are terrific.

139
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,727
That's all.

140
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,887
Thank you.

141
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,848
- Hey, what's that?
- It's an early Christmas present.

142
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,522
- A Christmas present?
- That's right.

143
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,281
- For who?
- For you.

144
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,608
Get out of here.

145
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,843
Say you got a big job interview
and you're nervous.

146
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,920
Throw back a couple of shots
of Hennigan's...

147
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,161
...and you'll be as loose as a goose
and ready to roll in no time.

148
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:41,287
And because it's odourless,
why, it'll be our little secret.

149
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:45,278
Kramer.

150
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,560
Yeah. That'll do.

151
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:55,286
Oh, George, this is beautiful.
Is this cashmere?

152
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,203
- Of course it's cashmere.
- Oh, I love cashmere.

153
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,519
- Who doesn't?
- Oh, my God.

154
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,805
George, this must have
cost a fortune.

155
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,926
Money.

156
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,643
Jerry, how could you
let him spend so much?

157
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,242
I tried to stop him.

158
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,443
I couldn't. He just wants
to make people happy.

159
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,804
George, this is one of the nicest
things anyone has ever given me.

160
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:22,961
Good. Good. Listen, take it off.
You're gonna wear it out already.

161
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,926
It's for special occasions, this thing.

162
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,929
What's that red dot
on your sweater?

163
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,357
- What?
- Listen, take it off.

164
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,599
I'm getting hot just looking at it.

165
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,237
What is this?
It's like a red dot.

166
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,479
What? What red dot?
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,119
Jerry, come here for a second.
Do you see anything here?

168
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,481
I don't know.

169
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,568
I don't know.

170
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,359
- What don't you know?
- I don't know.

171
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:58,249
Well, do you see it, or don't you?

172
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,208
Say that again.

173
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,078
Do you see it, or don't you?

174
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:09,039
Do I see it or don't I?
That's the question.

175
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,441
Now, what did you ask me again?

176
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,678
You're still here?
You're a dynamo.

177
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,285
- I can't believe I get paid for this.
- God.

178
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:48,442
I'll see you tomorrow.

179
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,121
- How you doing?
- Hello.

180
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:11,887
You had sex with the cleaning woman
on your desk?

181
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,559
Who are you?
How did you do that?

182
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:16,963
Hennigan's.

183
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:18,918
Hennigan's?

184
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,002
I was sitting there in the office,
and the cleaning woman comes in.

185
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,967
I've always been attracted
to cleaning women.

186
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:29,999
Cleaning women, chambermaids...

187
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:33,207
Yeah, chambermaids,
I'm attracted to them too.

188
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,839
- Why is that?
- It's a woman in your room.

189
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:41,802
- So go ahead.
- So...

190
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:47,362
...she starts vacuuming,
back and forth, back and forth...

191
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,759
...her hips swivelling...

192
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,999
...her breasts...

193
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:54,366
Convulsing?

194
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:58,007
- Convulsing?
- I don't know. I'm trying to help you.

195
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,126
So then I asked her
if she wanted a drink.

196
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:03,201
- You don't drink.
- I couldn't think of anything else to say.

197
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:07,123
- So you started drinking.
- So we started drinking, and...

198
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,484
I don't know if it was the alcohol
or the ammonia...

199
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,561
...but the next thing I knew,
she was mopping the floor with me.

200
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,884
- And how was it?
- The sex was okay...

201
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:20,483
...but I threw up
from the Hennigan's.

202
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:24,844
Good thing the cleaning lady
was there.

203
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:30,997
Dick was fired.

204
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:34,684
You mean to tell me, I put that drink
six inches over to the right...

205
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:37,682
...and this wouldn't have happened?
- You knew he was an alcoholic.

206
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,079
- Why'd you put the drink down?
- What are you saying?

207
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,241
- I'm not saying anything.
- Yes, you are.

208
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,718
- What could I be saying?
- You must be saying something.

209
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,641
If I was, I would have said it.

210
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,003
- Say it.
- I said it.

211
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:49,841
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

212
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:54,197
It's exhausting being with you.

213
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,158
- Yeah.
- It's George.

214
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:59,445
- Come on up.
- Hey.

215
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,283
Let me ask you something.

216
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,361
Did George buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

217
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,406
...because it was cheaper?

218
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:10,883
- Okay. You just gave me the answer.
- No, I didn't.

219
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,322
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
I saw your expression.

220
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:17,765
I didn't have an expression.
I have a deviated septum.

221
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,647
I have to...

222
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:22,040
I have to open my mouth
sometimes to breathe.

223
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,920
How much did he save?

224
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:30,888
Frankly, I am shocked that you
could ask such a question of me.

225
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,325
If l... The only surprise was how
you could even think of that.

226
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:37,128
That's what you were seeing.

227
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,361
I have to talk to you.

228
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:43,759
This cleaning woman's
turning the screws on me.

229
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,965
She's pushing for this
whole relationship thing.

230
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,768
She keeps calling me.
She's threatening to go to the boss.

231
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,204
I could lose my job.
I gotta keep her quiet.

232
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,923
Elaine's in the bathroom.
She's wise to the red-dot thing.

233
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,728
She's asking me
all kinds of questions about it.

234
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,561
- Did you tell her anything?
- No.

235
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:03,004
- You swear?
- I'm not swearing. I don't wanna swear.

236
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,363
- Come on, swear.
- No.

237
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:06,565
- Oh, you told her, didn't you?
- No.

238
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:10,881
Hey, George, did you buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

239
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,438
...because you could get it
at a discount?

240
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,247
What?

241
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:18,044
- Did I what?
- You did, didn't you?

242
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,686
Elaine, I'm shocked.
I'm shocked.

243
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:26,206
Here I go out, in the spirit of the
season and spend all my savings...

244
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,839
...to buy you the most beautiful
Christmas sweater I have ever seen...

245
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,569
...to show my appreciation to you
at Christmas...

246
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,368
...and this is the thanks I get
at Christmas.

247
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,798
- Well, Jerry told me that you did.
- You told her?

248
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,483
How could you tell her?
What kind of friend are you?

249
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,119
I didn't tell her, you stupid idiot.
She tricked you.

250
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,638
Elaine, you don't understand.

251
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:56,644
I had a 103 temperature
when I bought that sweater.

252
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,528
I was so dizzy, I was seeing
red dots everywhere.

253
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:02,238
I thought everything in the store
had a red dot on it.

254
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,685
I couldn't distinguish one red dot
from the other.

255
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:07,762
I couldn't afford anything.

256
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:11,604
I have nothing. I haven't worked
for a really long time.

257
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,078
I mean, look, I have no clothes.

258
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,682
Look at what I'm wearing.

259
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:17,726
It was just a little red dot.

260
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,039
A little red dot.

261
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:28,800
- This is for you.
- Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me?

262
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,046
Oh, I knew you cared for me.

263
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,087
As you care for me,
which is why it's very important...

264
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,207
...that you never breathe a word
to anyone about...

265
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:40,964
You know? What with
Clarence Thomas and everything.

266
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,238
- Okay. Can I open it now?
- Yes, of course. Go ahead.

267
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:47,207
My guess is you're gonna
like this very much.

268
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:53,606
- Is that cashmere?
- Of course it's cashmere.

269
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,363
Oh, a cashmere sweater.

270
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,406
Oh, Georgie Porgie.

271
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,560
Just a little something for Christmas.

272
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:07,960
When I was a little girl in Panama,
a rich American came to our town.

273
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:11,644
And he was wearing the softest,
most beautiful sweater.

274
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:15,518
I said, "What do you call
this beautiful fabric?"

275
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:17,648
And he said:

276
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,642
"They call it cashmere."

277
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:26,878
I repeated the word.
"Cashmere, cashmere"...

278
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:29,119
...and I asked him if I could have it...

279
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:30,968
...and he said:

280
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,359
"No. Get away from me."

281
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,805
And he started to walk away.

282
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,039
Oh, but I grabbed onto his leg...

283
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,120
...screaming for him
to give me the sweater...

284
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,359
...and he dragged me
through the streets.

285
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,679
And then he kicked me
with the other foot...

286
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:48,158
...and he threw some change at me.

287
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,480
But I didn't want the change, Georgie.

288
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,038
I wanted the cashmere.

289
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,239
I had a feeling you would like it.

290
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,128
- I'm going to try it on.
- No. Don't try it on now. Try it later.

291
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,201
Oh, look, it fits beautiful.

292
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:10,167
All right, take it off.
You're gonna ruin it.

293
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:12,481
What's this?

294
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,047
I was in a men's room the other day.

295
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,088
They had the hand blower instead of
the paper towels. You know this thing?

296
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:21,967
I like the hand blower, I have to say.

297
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,519
Takes a little bit longer,
but I feel when you're in a room...

298
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:29,204
...with a revolting stench, you want
to spend as much time as you can.

299
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,123
The only stench is coming from you.

300
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,608
Oh, well, wait a second.

301
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,567
I believe we have a heckler,
ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,367
Dick, I don't know
what your problem is.

303
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,520
It's not my fault
you're back on the wagon.

304
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,645
It's "off the wagon."

305
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,245
In the old days, how do you think they
got the alcohol from town to town?

306
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:51,600
- I don't know.
- On a wagon.

307
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:56,128
Don't you think they broke into a
couple of those bottles along the way?

308
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,644
You can't drink on a wagon.
It's too bumpy.

309
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,243
They had smooth trails.
What about the Cumberland Gap?

310
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:03,445
What the hell do you know
about wagons?

311
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:06,077
I know enough not to get on them.

312
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,203
I'm gonna get right to the point.

313
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,362
It's come to my attention
that you and the cleaning woman...

314
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:18,238
...have engaged in sexual intercourse
on the desk in your office.

315
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:20,723
Is that correct?

316
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,959
- Who said that?
- She did.

317
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:30,081
Was that wrong?

318
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,885
Should I not have done that?

319
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,880
I gotta plead ignorance
on this thing...

320
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,244
...because if anyone
had said anything to me...

321
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:41,288
...when I started here that that
sort of thing was frowned upon...

322
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,399
You know, because I've worked
in a lot of offices...

323
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,845
...and I tell you,
people do that all the time.

324
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,766
You're fired.

325
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,684
Well, you didn't have
to say it like that.

326
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,079
I want you out of here
by the end of the day.

327
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,882
What about the whole Christmas-spirit
thing? Any flexibility there?

328
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:11,562
No.

329
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,161
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

330
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:19,123
She wanted me to give you this.

331
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,885
You had sex on your desk
with the cleaning woman.

332
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:35,487
You never had sex
in the office before?

333
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,568
No. I once made out with someone,
but that's it.

334
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,720
Okay. All right. So you made out.

335
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,119
- Well, that's not sex.
- Kissing is sex.

336
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,366
Kissing is not sex.

337
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:47,679
- George.
- Jerry.

338
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:51,922
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink
next to Dick's on purpose?

339
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,001
- No.
- George?

340
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:55,602
Over here.

341
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,477
What are you doing here?

342
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:01,004
I'm taking the kid out to dinner
to cheer him up.

343
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,127
Hey, Jerry, when do you consider sex
has taken place?

344
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:07,046
I would say...

345
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,279
...when the nipple
makes its first appearance.

346
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:20,641
So George told me that you left
the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

347
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,281
Nice try.

348
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:30,038
So guess who heckled me
at the club last night.

349
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,328
Merry Christmas!

350
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,605
- Oh, my God, that's Dick.
- Dick?

351
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:38,122
Dick!

352
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,918
It's Cape Fear.

353
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:44,600
Hide. Hide under the desk.

354
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,122
- Move over.
- Get off of me.

355
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:51,008
- I have no room.
- My foot's sticking out.

356
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,205
Shut up. He's coming.

357
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,202
Is that cashmere?

358
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,842
Of course it's cashmere.

359
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,123
What's this?

360
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:26,725
But, in a way, I think I inadvertently
turned this guy into an alcoholic.

361
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:28,447
I hate being around alcoholics.

362
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:31,999
They're either saying how much they
love you or how much they hate you.

363
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,805
Those are the two statements
that scare me most.

364
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,961
But I think he's okay now because
I don't know how he feels about me.

365
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:41,201
- He's finally off the wagon.
- You mean on the wagon.

366
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:42,563
Don't get smart.

367
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:33,600

368
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:39,481
I'm going to get
a physical examination.

369
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:44,474
That urine sample. Giving them that,
that's always a pleasure, isn't it?

370
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,555
Then there's always
the amount question:

371
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:50,393
"I don't know what you need.
I gave you whatever I had there.

372
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,113
I got more. Whatever you need,
I can get it for you.

373
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:57,037
Just let me know what you need.
It's no problem, I mean..."

374
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,923
But any kind of physical test,
I don't know what it is...

375
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,837
...I always click into this thing
where I wanna do really well.

376
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:05,279
If it's gonna be a physical test,
I wanna do well.

377
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:07,321
Remember in school,
they'd do hearing tests?

378
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:10,123
And you'd really be listening,
you know...

379
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:13,197
...trying to really...
Trying to do well, I wanna do well.

380
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:15,195
I wanted to do unbelievable
on that test.

381
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:18,003
I wanted them to come to me
after the test and go:

382
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:21,281
"We think you may have something
close to super hearing.

383
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:26,076
What you heard was a cotton ball
touching a piece of felt.

384
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,643
We're sending the results
to Washington.

385
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,155
We'd like you
to meet the president."

386
00:22:39,364 --> 00:22:40,558
Let me ask you a question.

387
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:43,513
If you named a kid Rasputin...

388
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:46,960
...do you think that would have
a negative effect on his life?

389
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:48,952
No.

390
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:51,554
What are you doing?
We're going out to dinner.

391
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,955
Do you realize this is the last meal
I'm gonna have for three days?

392
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:58,672
- Yeah.
- George.

393
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,402
Come on up.

394
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:04,120
I never heard of this. You gotta fast
for three days to take an ulcer test.

395
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:05,922
- How will you do that?
- I don't know.

396
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:10,555
How could I possibly have ulcers?
Who could have given me ulcers?

397
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:13,801
I think I'll take out the garbage.

398
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:15,597
Have you ever fasted?

399
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:18,358
Well, once I didn't have
dinner till, like, 9:00.

400
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:21,113
I'll tell you, that was pretty rough.

401
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:26,163
Hey. Do me a favour, will you?

402
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,201
Throw out my garbage for me.

403
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:30,442
Yeah. Right.

404
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:34,002
Come on. It's just down the hall.

405
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:37,439
Give me 2 bucks.
I'll do it for 2 bucks.

406
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:40,638
I'll give you 50 cents.

407
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:43,034
There's no way I'd touch that bag
for less than $2.

408
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:46,355
Come on, 50 cents. You can
get yourself a Drake's Coffee Cake.

409
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:51,038
You're not getting no
Drake's Coffee Cake for 50 cents.

410
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,561
I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going
to the Cayman Islands Friday.

411
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,716
I don't get you. Who goes
on vacation without a job?

412
00:23:57,884 --> 00:24:00,398
What do you need, a break
from getting up at 11?

413
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,438
It's a deal. I don't know
why you don't come with me.

414
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:06,276
I don't go for nonrefundable deals.

415
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,436
I can't commit to a woman,
I'm not committing to an airline.

416
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:13,437
- Hi.
- Hi.

417
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:14,838
How are you?

418
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:16,722
Gina, do you know
Drake's Coffee Cake?

419
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,352
The plain cake with the sweet
brown crumbs on the top.

420
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,674
- Right. How much do they cost?
- The junior?

421
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:23,277
- No, the full-size.
- No, junior.

422
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:26,641
- You didn't say "junior."
- I haven't had one since I was little.

423
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:27,998
Really?

424
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:31,839
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I want you out of here.

425
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:37,955
- How you doing?
- Good enough.

426
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:44,162
- Boy, she's sexy, isn't she?
- Yeah.

427
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,675
- Do you believe that guy?
- What guy?

428
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:02,074
- My neighbour.
- That creepy guy?

429
00:25:02,244 --> 00:25:05,441
- Did he think I was flirting with her?
- He didn't seem too pleased.

430
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:09,682
Maybe I'll get a steak
with French-fried onion rings.

431
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:11,756
Hey, you know what?

432
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,995
I just remembered something.

433
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:17,793
I had a dream about that guy
last night. This is amazing.

434
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,717
- Amazing? You've seen him before.
- I haven't seen him in months.

435
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:22,397
What was the dream?

436
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:26,398
He was doing standup comedy
in Kennebunkport, Maine...

437
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:28,714
...in this really ominous nightclub.

438
00:25:28,884 --> 00:25:30,875
The stage was on a cliff
and the audience...

439
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:32,875
...was throwing all the comics off.

440
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:35,433
I think I've played there.

441
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:38,320
I've had a lot of paranormal stuff
happen to me.

442
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:40,600
You're a little paranormal.

443
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:43,039
Name one paranormal thing
that happened to you.

444
00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:46,002
- I knew I was gonna be bald.
- Your father's bald.

445
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:48,632
Baldness is inherited
from the mother's side, Jerry.

446
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:51,034
But your mother's bald too.

447
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:54,834
George, you know,
my friend goes to a psychic.

448
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:57,040
- Really?
- We should go sometime.

449
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:58,922
I'd love to go.
Make an appointment.

450
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,962
Psychics, vacations.
How about getting a job?

451
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:07,473
- I just got fired.
- All right. Let's get out of here.

452
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:09,794
I wonder what Gandhi ate
before his fast.

453
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:12,239
I heard he used to polish off
a box of Triscuits.

454
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,795
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Gandhi loved Triscuits.

455
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:21,036
Who is it?

456
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,556
- Who is it?
- It's Gina!

457
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,999
- Who?
- Martin's girlfriend.

458
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:28,553
- Martin?
- Your next-door neighbour.

459
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:30,357
Oh, Martin!

460
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:33,914
It's Martin. I think he's dying.
He tried to kill himself with pills.

461
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:35,278
- What?
- Come on.

462
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,560
- Let me get my robe.
- We do not have time.

463
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,237
- Two seconds.
- There's no time.

464
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:41,520
- We don't have two seconds?
- All right, go ahead.

465
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,436
- No, forget it.
- No, go ahead.

466
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,674
- No, I'll just wear the pyjamas.
- Just get it!

467
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:47,994
- Are you sure?
- Forget it. Come on.

468
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:50,234
No, I'll go get the robe.

469
00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:58,520
It's not too bad. It's not
like a Sunny von Bülow coma.

470
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:03,920
Doctor said he should
snap out of it any time.

471
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:07,394
You know why he did this?
Because I told him it was over.

472
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:10,715
- I did not want to see him anymore.
- Really? It's over?

473
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:13,919
I could not stand it another minute.

474
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,479
Yesterday, he turned over
a hot dog stand...

475
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:18,555
...because he thought
the man looked at me.

476
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:23,515
Then, after he saw you in the hall...
He was crazy with jealousy.

477
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:25,796
Oh, boy.

478
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:28,159
Did he say anything about me?

479
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,394
He does not like you.

480
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:36,153
And all indications are he does not
like Drake's Coffee Cake.

481
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:40,321
- He said that?
- He was screaming about it all night.

482
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,681
How it's too sweet and
it falls apart when you eat it.

483
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:47,842
I'm sorry if I caused any trouble.
I was just being friendly.

484
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:50,116
I wasn't.

485
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:52,276
You weren't?

486
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:56,960
No. I have thought
about you many times.

487
00:27:57,284 --> 00:28:01,118
- Have you thought about me?
- Of course.

488
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:05,281
Tell me everything.

489
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:08,153
Are you sure
he can't hear anything?

490
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:11,562
Martin.

491
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,242
Martin!

492
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,518
I wish he was not in a coma.
I wish he was dead.

493
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:22,315
I would like to pull the plug out
from him!

494
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:25,157
I would wait on that one.

495
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:27,440
I know how you feel,
but juries today...

496
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:30,072
...you never know how
they're gonna look at this.

497
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:35,198
I saw you looking at your watch.
You want to leave? Go ahead.

498
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:38,003
- I wanted to see what time it was.
- Are you afraid of him?

499
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:39,677
- No.
- Then kiss me.

500
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,436
- Here?
- Yes, right here.

501
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:44,199
Is this the proper venue?

502
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,715
- You don't want to?
- No, no, I want to.

503
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:50,035
I very much want to. I desire to.
I pine to.

504
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:51,842
Then kiss me right in front of him.

505
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:54,518
I can't! What if he wakes up?

506
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:57,403
A man is lying here unconscious
and you're afraid of him?

507
00:28:57,844 --> 00:28:59,835
What kind of a man are you?

508
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,598
I'm a man who respects a good coma.

509
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:08,074
If it was one of those
in-and-out comas, maybe.

510
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:11,202
But when a guy's got a coma
going like this...

511
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:13,400
...you don't wanna mess with it.

512
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,195
- Hey.
- Hey.

513
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,872
- Did you hear about Martin?
- Yeah, I heard.

514
00:29:22,044 --> 00:29:25,559
I can't believe he's in a coma.
He's got my vacuum cleaner.

515
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:31,599
I loaned it to him, he never
returned it. The carpets are filthy.

516
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:34,562
- What am I gonna do?
- Who told you about Martin?

517
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:36,601
Newman.
He's good friends with him.

518
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:39,353
Bigmouth Newman.
I should have guessed.

519
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,317
He's got all my attachments,
you know.

520
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:45,278
Let me ask you something.
How long do you have to wait...

521
00:29:45,444 --> 00:29:48,800
...for a guy to come out of a coma
before you ask his ex-girlfriend out?

522
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:50,642
Oh, Gina?

523
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:54,360
Why wait?
Why not just call Dr. Kevorkian.

524
00:29:56,924 --> 00:29:58,915
I don't get that
whole suicide machine.

525
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:01,757
There's no tall buildings
where these people live?

526
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:05,718
They can't wrap their lips around
a revolver like a normal person?

527
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,242
What's going on
between you and Gina?

528
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:10,793
Well, I went with her
to the hospital last night.

529
00:30:11,084 --> 00:30:15,441
So we're in the room and she's trying
to get me to kiss her in front of him.

530
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,834
That's the great thing
about Mediterranean women.

531
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:19,517
All right. So, what did you do?

532
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:24,719
- Nothing.
- What kind of a man are you?

533
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:26,715
The guy is unconscious, in a coma...

534
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:29,637
...and you don't have the guts
to kiss his girlfriend?

535
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:31,835
I didn't know what
the coma etiquette was.

536
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,756
There is no coma etiquette.

537
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:37,519
See, that's the beauty of the coma.
It doesn't matter what you do.

538
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:43,435
So you're saying his girl, his car,
his clothes, it's all up for grabs.

539
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:45,601
You can just loot the coma victim.

540
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:48,963
I give them 24 hours to get out of it.

541
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:52,594
They can't get out of it
by 24 hours, it's a land rush.

542
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:56,873
So if the coma victim wakes up
in a month...

543
00:30:57,044 --> 00:30:59,194
...he's thrilled. He got out of the coma.

544
00:30:59,364 --> 00:31:02,037
- He goes home, there's nothing left?
- Nothing left!

545
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:08,682
That's why I'm trying to get that
vacuum. Somebody's gonna grab it.

546
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:16,641
Martin's spirit came to you
as a warning.

547
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:18,237
Why would he come to George?

548
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:20,838
Because George has heightened
extrasensory perception.

549
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,801
Faithy, get your finger
out of your nose!

550
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,877
- I knew it. I always felt different.
- You are. Some coffee cake?

551
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:29,959
- Drake's?
- Yes.

552
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:32,115
- Did you buy this for me?
- No, why?

553
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,354
Because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.

554
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:38,357
- Maybe I did.
- Take it away.

555
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,480
She hasn't eaten in two days.

556
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:43,841
- Who's Pauline?
- Pauline?

557
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:46,200
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

558
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:49,401
My brother once impregnated
a woman named Pauline.

559
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:51,600
- You think about her?
- When I hear her name.

560
00:31:52,564 --> 00:31:54,361
Cut these with your left hand.

561
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:01,353
There was a woman. Audrey.

562
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:03,441
She had a very big nose.

563
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,234
I see an Audrey,
but with a small nose.

564
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:09,077
Yes, yes. She had a nose job.

565
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:11,639
I loved her very deeply.

566
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,283
Will she ever speak to me again?

567
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:15,596
Not in this life.

568
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:19,201
- Should you be smoking?
- Does it bother you?

569
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,723
- You're pregnant.
- Elaine.

570
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:23,474
I smoked when I had Faithy.

571
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:26,478
What? What?

572
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,555
I don't know about this trip, George.

573
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:30,601
You can see the Cayman Islands
in there?

574
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:32,482
Is something gonna happen
to me? What?

575
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:34,839
It's really bad for the foetus,
you know that?

576
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:37,279
She's a psychic.
She knows how the kid's gonna be.

577
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:39,912
Should I not go on this trip?

578
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:41,683
George...

579
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:46,236
...I am going to tell you something
and I want you to really hear me.

580
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,956
Now, listen, I just don't know
how a person, with everything...

581
00:32:50,124 --> 00:32:55,596
...we now know about prenatal care,
can put a cigarette in her mouth!

582
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:57,562
- What are you doing?
- It's disgusting.

583
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,282
- I don't need this!
- Look, please!

584
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,435
- I would like you both to leave.
- Oh, fine.

585
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,801
Well, I don't like to be around people
who are just so irresponsible.

586
00:33:04,964 --> 00:33:08,320
- Get the hell out.
- A plane crash?! A heart attack?!

587
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:09,758
Lupus? Is it lupus?

588
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:13,553
Do you want me to call the super?
He was an Israeli commando.

589
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,957
If you don't say anything,
I'll assume it's a plane crash.

590
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:21,560
- Get out.
- Not a plane crash.

591
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:24,474
Is it a plane crash?

592
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:26,917
Psychics should be licensed.

593
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:30,315
And it wouldn't be hard. We could
just give them the regular DMV test...

594
00:33:30,484 --> 00:33:33,556
...only with the silver dollars and
the pizza dough over the eyes.

595
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:36,801
If you can do the parallel park
like that, you're a psychic.

596
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,319
We can test these people,
no question about it.

597
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,282
Like Kreskin. Instead
of just hiding his check...

598
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:45,402
...why don't we try
stopping his check.

599
00:33:45,564 --> 00:33:47,714
Let's see how he handles that.

600
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:51,080
I do not like your toothbrush.

601
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:53,356
There are no bristles.

602
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:56,280
You can say what you want
about me...

603
00:33:56,444 --> 00:33:58,639
...but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna stand here...

604
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:01,034
...while you insult my toothbrush.

605
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:05,714
It is too small for someone
with such a big mouth.

606
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,121
Let me ask you...

607
00:34:10,644 --> 00:34:14,239
...what will you do if Martin
wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

608
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:18,836
No, more like the Three Stooges
at the end of every movie.

609
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,676
Who are these Stooges
you speak of?

610
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,156
They're a comedy team.

611
00:34:25,084 --> 00:34:27,359
Tell me about them. Everything.

612
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:32,276
Well, they're three funny-looking guys
and they'd hit each other a lot.

613
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:36,478
- You will show me the Stooges?
- I will show you the Stooges.

614
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,162
- When?
- Well...

615
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:43,038
...I don't really know where
the Stooges are right now...

616
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:45,957
...but if I locate them,
you'll be the first to know.

617
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,922
Come. You walk me to a cab.

618
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:52,360
Well, I...

619
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:54,760
I don't want you to get upset
or anything...

620
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:58,439
...but with Martin and all, maybe it's
not a good idea to be seen together...

621
00:34:58,604 --> 00:35:00,879
...in the building,
because he had a lot of friends.

622
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:03,319
You are still afraid.
You are not a man.

623
00:35:03,564 --> 00:35:07,193
Well, then what are all those ties and
sport jackets doing in my closet?

624
00:35:07,924 --> 00:35:09,755
Are you going to walk me
to a cab or not?

625
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:13,042
Yeah, all right, all right.

626
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,077
- Why don't you just eat fruit.
- Fruit makes me incontinent.

627
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,836
I don't want you eating over here.

628
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,923
Hello, Gina. Hello, Jerry.

629
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,435
Hello, Newman.

630
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:39,037
Do you think Newman
would tell Martin if he wakes up?

631
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,514
What kind of sicko would do that?
He could kill me.

632
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,362
People smoke, Elaine.

633
00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:46,522
My mother smoked.

634
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:49,075
It didn't hurt me.

635
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:53,318
Did you guys see that wall move?

636
00:35:54,604 --> 00:35:56,640
Boy, it's a good thing we came.

637
00:35:56,964 --> 00:35:59,159
Could there be a native problem
in the Caymans?

638
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,643
Maybe there's native unrest.

639
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:04,160
Hi. I haven't eaten in three days.

640
00:36:04,524 --> 00:36:07,994
I was wondering how much longer
it would be till I get my X-ray.

641
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:09,592
We'll call you.

642
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:13,553
George, I want you to promise me
something. If I'm ever in a coma...

643
00:36:13,724 --> 00:36:18,081
...in the first 24 hours, get everything
out of my place and put it in storage.

644
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:21,673
- How come?
- Looters.

645
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:25,601
How do we know the dog food's
any good?

646
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:30,234
Who tastes it?

647
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:32,599
She is really hungry.

648
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,479
- Hey.
- Kramer.

649
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:38,718
Well, Newman's upstairs
visiting Martin.

650
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,636
Would you buy
my Cayman Island ticket?

651
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:45,003
- You're not going?
- No.

652
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:46,643
- Why not?
- The psychic said...

653
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,396
...something terrible will happen.

654
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,682
I dig.

655
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:56,714
I want my vacuum cleaner!

656
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:59,400
Martin, I know you can hear me.

657
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:03,159
Look, my mother's coming to visit me.
She sees that rug, she's gonna kill me.

658
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:06,680
He can't hear you, you idiot.
Why don't you just buy another one.

659
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:11,000
Why would I buy another one when
I spent 100 bucks on this one?

660
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,275
I have a carpet sweeper
you can use.

661
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:16,641
I don't want a carpet sweeper.
They don't do anything.

662
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,203
It gets my rug clean.

663
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:20,880
The carpet sweeper
is the biggest scam...

664
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:24,559
...perpetrated on the American
public since One Hour Martinizing.

665
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:26,442
You should take a look
at my rug, then.

666
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:28,799
I wouldn't set foot in your house.

667
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,272
- Hello.
- Hey.

668
00:37:32,444 --> 00:37:34,162
Hello, Jerry.

669
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:39,595
- How's he doing?
- Well, he looks happy to me.

670
00:37:39,764 --> 00:37:43,154
I hope he stays this happy
when he wakes up.

671
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:45,918
- Why wouldn't he?
- No reason.

672
00:37:46,404 --> 00:37:48,872
He'll have a lot of catching up
to do, I guess.

673
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:51,354
I'll bring him up to date.

674
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:54,198
- How up to date?
- All the way up.

675
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:57,995
Nothing could change your mind?

676
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:03,159
Well, it would take a lot, because
a friend is something you earn.

677
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:07,676
Jerry has a friend who has free tickets
to the Cayman Islands this weekend.

678
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:09,996
He's not going.

679
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:13,440
I don't care much for the beach.
I freckle.

680
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:21,076
- Is that a...?
- Drake's Coffee Cake.

681
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:25,798
Where did you get that?

682
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:30,074
From my house.
I got a whole box of them.

683
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:33,443
Boy. That's the full-size.

684
00:38:34,324 --> 00:38:36,235
That's your big boy.

685
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:39,682
Can I have a bite?

686
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,954
I don't like to give out bites.

687
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:44,115
I got another one...

688
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:46,957
...but I'm saving it for later.

689
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:49,882
Just one bite?

690
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:53,559
I don't think so.
You know, they're so fragile.

691
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:56,318
All right! All right.

692
00:38:56,724 --> 00:38:57,918
I won't say anything.

693
00:38:58,084 --> 00:39:00,075
- You swear?
- I swear.

694
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:03,202
- On your mother's life?
- On my mother's life.

695
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,955
But here it was...

696
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:19,559
...mountains of duck.

697
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:26,239
And not fatty duck either,
but juicy, tender breasts of duck.

698
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:28,283
- Beautifully sliced...
- Faithy!

699
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:29,877
Sweetheart, no, don't run!

700
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:31,921
You could take
as much as you want...

701
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:35,793
Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Faithy!

702
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:44,878
Hi. Hi! What are you doing here?
How did I know you were here?

703
00:39:45,044 --> 00:39:47,604
Something drew me here.
This is phenomenal.

704
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,083
The nurse said she'd be back.

705
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:50,996
Supposed to take me
to the delivery room.

706
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:53,394
Oh, that's great. That's great.

707
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:56,283
I have to apologize for my friend
the other day...

708
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,435
Friend? I don't even
know that woman.

709
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,993
I met her on the way over.
I couldn't get rid of her.

710
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:04,122
I tell you, my psychic instincts
were a little off...

711
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:07,282
- Where's the nurse?
- I'm sure she'll be right back.

712
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:10,197
Sweetheart, why don't you
run and get a nurse for Mommy.

713
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:13,754
I was just curious. The other day
you said something about my trip.

714
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,916
- Don't take that trip.
- Yeah! Why? Why?

715
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:20,034
- Because... Because...
- All right, Rula. It's time to go.

716
00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:22,519
Yeah, because...? Because...?

717
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:27,436
Assassins! How dare they keep
a person waiting like this!

718
00:40:29,124 --> 00:40:30,477
Drake's Coffee Cake?

719
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:33,679
- Give me that!
- Jerry, you better stop her or I'll tell!

720
00:40:33,844 --> 00:40:36,802
Elaine, no! No!

721
00:40:40,324 --> 00:40:43,680
Are there terrorists on the plane?
A hotel fire, is that it?

722
00:40:43,844 --> 00:40:47,598
Typhus? Malaria? Yellow fever?
Lupus? Is it lupus?

723
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:50,437
They did it right in this bed, Martin.
Right in front of you.

724
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:53,164
- I want my vacuum cleaner!
- I can explain!

725
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:55,201
It was disgusting!

726
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:03,077
What are you doing?
We're going to dinner in 10 minutes.

727
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:06,564
I never assisted in a birth before.

728
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:08,596
It's really quite disgusting.

729
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:11,513
- What did she name the kid?
- You wouldn't believe it.

730
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:13,879
Rasputin.

731
00:41:15,364 --> 00:41:17,594
- Hey!
- Hey!

732
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:21,043
- When did you get back?
- A couple hours ago.

733
00:41:21,204 --> 00:41:23,672
- So how was it?
- George...

734
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:28,555
...I would like to thank you
for the greatest four days of my life.

735
00:41:29,644 --> 00:41:33,034
They were shooting the
Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue...

736
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:36,594
...right in the hotel pool.
Not only that...

737
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:39,642
...the hotel opened up an area
on the beach for nude bathing...

738
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:41,681
...and all of the models
went down there.

739
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:46,113
I am on the next blanket
from Elle Macpherson.

740
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,762
We played backgammon nude.

741
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:52,642
- Oh, she's a sweet kid.
- Nude backgammon...

742
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:55,193
...with swimsuit models!

743
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:58,993
Oh, you know what? The second day
I was there, I stepped on a jellyfish.

744
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:04,238
It stung my foot. That's probably what
Rula was trying to warn you about.

745
00:42:04,404 --> 00:42:06,520
- You gotta watch for the jellyfish.
- Yeah.

746
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:08,798
What's this?

747
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:12,274
It's an invitation to a housewarming
for Martin and Gina.

748
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:15,436
- They moved in together?
- Yeah, some place in the Village.

749
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:20,601
- Yeah.
- It's Elaine.

750
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:22,595
All right, we're coming down.

751
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:24,994
- Where you going?
- We're taking Elaine to dinner.

752
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:27,837
She's gotta start the fast again.
You wanna go?

753
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:31,121
I'd like to, but a bunch of us
from the islands are getting together.

754
00:42:31,604 --> 00:42:34,562
- Elle Macpherson gonna be there?
- I gotta call her back.

755
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:40,036
The thing I don't understand
about the suicide person...

756
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:43,082
...is the people that try
and commit suicide...

757
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:47,840
...for some reason, they don't die,
and then that's it. They stop trying.

758
00:42:48,324 --> 00:42:49,723
Why?

759
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:53,194
Why don't they just keep trying?
What has changed? Is their life better?

760
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:56,556
No. In fact, it's worse,
because now they've found out...

761
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,477
...here's one more thing you stink at.

762
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,963
That's why these people don't
succeed at life to begin with.

763
00:43:03,124 --> 00:43:07,037
Because they give up too easy.
I say pills don't work, try a rope.

764
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:12,522
Car won't start in the garage?
Get a tune-up. You know what I mean?

765
00:43:12,684 --> 00:43:14,242
There's nothing more rewarding...

766
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:17,157
...than reaching a goal
you've set for yourself.

768
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,400
As a kid, my favourite ride...

769
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:14,321
...was the bumper car. Remember?
Going around in a circle.

770
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:16,557
There was always one kid
that could not do it.

771
00:44:16,727 --> 00:44:17,921
Do you remember this kid?

772
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:19,918
As soon as the ride gets started...

773
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:22,396
...he'd be, like, stuck
in a pack of empty cars.

774
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:24,241
Just...

775
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,118
"Excuse me.

776
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:30,443
Excuse me. It won't go!

777
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:32,076
Come on!

778
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:34,637
It's almost over!"

779
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:37,725
He always ends up
with the attendant...

780
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:40,447
...hanging off that big pole
helping him steer it.

781
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:45,446
"Stop crying."

782
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,281
Then there's always
that other...

783
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:48,880
One other really bad car...

784
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:50,480
The helpless father-and-son team.

785
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,478
This is another car just
not going anywhere.

786
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:54,763
They're never organized.
Who's on the wheel?

787
00:44:54,927 --> 00:44:56,360
Who's pressing on the gas? Just:

788
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,438
"Son, turn the wheel."

789
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,286
All right, Coney Island?

790
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:08,086
Okay, you can take the B or the F
and switch for the N...

791
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,475
...at Broadway and Lafayette.

792
00:45:09,647 --> 00:45:11,558
Or you can go over the bridge
to DeKalb...

793
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:13,365
...and catch the Q
to Atlantic Avenue...

794
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:16,405
...then switch to the IRT,
2, 3, 4 or 5.

795
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:17,795
But don't get on the G.

796
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:20,003
That's very tempting,
but you wind up on Smith...

797
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,362
...and 9th Street.
Then you gotta get on the R.

798
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:25,800
Couldn't he just take the D
straight to Coney Island?

799
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,440
Well, yeah.

800
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:32,600
Okay. What time is your
job interview, George?

801
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:33,961
9:45.

802
00:45:34,127 --> 00:45:35,401
Don't whistle on the elevator.

803
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:38,236
- Why not?
- That's what Willy Loman told Biff...

804
00:45:38,407 --> 00:45:40,557
...before his interview
in Death of a Salesman.

805
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:42,922
You're comparing me to Biff Loman?
Very encouraging.

806
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,726
The biggest loser in the history
of American literature.

807
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:48,162
- I gotta get going.
- What time's the lesbian wedding?

808
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:50,642
- 9:30.
- Lesbian wedding.

809
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:53,605
How do they work the bride and groom
on that? Do they flip a coin?

810
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,758
Yeah, they flip a coin.

811
00:45:56,327 --> 00:45:59,239
What, was that not politically correct?
It's a legitimate question.

812
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:02,844
I'm so tired. I'm gonna fall asleep
on that train.

813
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,441
I feel when lesbians are looking at me,
they're thinking:

814
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:07,404
"That's why I'm not a heterosexual."

815
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:12,240
All right, Jerry, come on.
Pick up the check so we can go.

816
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:13,920
- I'm paying for breakfast?
- Yeah.

817
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:16,555
- Yeah.
- Why do I always pay?

818
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:18,604
What am I, made of money?

819
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:20,320
You bunch of deadbeats.

820
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,599
How many tickets you paying today?

821
00:46:24,127 --> 00:46:28,166
Let's see. Speeding, running a
red light, no licence, no registration...

822
00:46:28,847 --> 00:46:31,839
...no plates, no brake lights,
no rear-view mirror.

823
00:46:32,407 --> 00:46:34,045
Look at that one.

824
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,637
- "No doors"?
- Yeah, I'm fighting that one.

825
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,722
You know, this is gonna cost me
over 600 bucks.

826
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:44,477
I can't carry change in these pants.
It falls out.

827
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:48,040
- Here you go.
- There you go.

828
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:49,521
Thank you.

829
00:46:52,087 --> 00:46:53,805
That guy's not blind.

830
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:57,527
So can I convince anybody
to come down to Coney Island?

831
00:46:57,687 --> 00:46:59,917
Gotta pick up my car
at the pound. George?

832
00:47:00,087 --> 00:47:01,884
I can't believe they found
your stolen car.

833
00:47:02,047 --> 00:47:03,366
Not only did they find it...

834
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:05,916
...it was simonized,
and the front end was aligned.

835
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:08,479
- That's amazing.
- So, what do you say?

836
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,956
Ride on the Cyclone.
Hot dog at Nathan's on me.

837
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:13,357
Who are you, Satan?
I'm close to a job here.

838
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:15,757
- It's my second interview.
- All right, Biff.

839
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:19,961
Elaine? Merry-go-round?

840
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:22,163
I can't. I'm the best man.

841
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:24,643
Kramer. Bumper cars.

842
00:47:24,807 --> 00:47:27,765
I gotta go to court. I'll get in trouble.
What's the matter with you?

843
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:30,043
It could be years till I get
back to Coney Island.

844
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:31,481
I can't go on the rides alone.

845
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:34,400
42nd Street. Change for the D
and the double R...

846
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,876
...the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7,
the C, K and F train.

847
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:51,759
Well...

848
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:56,201
See you.

849
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:45,396
Hey!

850
00:48:51,487 --> 00:48:52,681
Yeah!

851
00:49:42,207 --> 00:49:45,836
- You looking for a job?
- Me? Why?

852
00:49:46,207 --> 00:49:48,163
Well, you're reading
the classifieds.

853
00:49:48,327 --> 00:49:50,397
Oh, no. No, no.

854
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:53,445
I was just looking for the stock page.
Here it is.

855
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:55,400
Looking for the quotes.

856
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:56,966
Gotta check the quotes.

857
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,879
Love a good quote.

858
00:49:59,527 --> 00:50:01,245
IBM up a quarter.

859
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:02,881
What do you know?

860
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:06,121
You didn't look like someone
who needed a job.

861
00:50:06,327 --> 00:50:09,364
Me? No, I don't.

862
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:13,676
Doing very well. Very well, yeah.

863
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:15,321
So you're in the market?

864
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,638
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm in the market.

865
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,001
Which market?

866
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:23,447
Which market? The... The big one.

867
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,916
The big market with the big board.

868
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:29,523
Bull market, bear market.
You name the market, I'm there.

869
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:32,962
So do you work for one of
the big brokerage houses?

870
00:50:33,127 --> 00:50:34,401
They wish.

871
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:35,920
I hate the big brokerage houses.

872
00:50:36,087 --> 00:50:37,520
Hate them with a passion.

873
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:39,405
Big brokerage houses
killed my father.

874
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:42,077
- Really?
- Well, they hurt him bad.

875
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,238
Really hurt his feelings.

876
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:47,444
It's a long story.
I don't like to talk about it...

877
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,681
...but I swore I would never work
for a big brokerage house.

878
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,759
See, all they care about is money.

879
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:56,716
I'm about more than money.
I'm about...

880
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,081
...people.

881
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,363
So I've always gone my own way...

882
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:02,639
...and I've never looked back.

883
00:51:24,087 --> 00:51:26,282
I started riding these trains
in the '40s.

884
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:30,487
Those days, a man would give up
his seat for a woman.

885
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:34,247
Now we're liberated.
We have to stand.

886
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,721
It's ironic.

887
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,195
What's ironic?

888
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,360
This. That we've come all this way,
we made all this progress...

889
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:43,439
...but, you know, we lost
the little things, the niceties.

890
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,397
No, I mean, what does
"ironic" mean?

891
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:51,597
Where you off to
with such a nice present?

892
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:53,803
- Birthday party?
- A wedding.

893
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:55,685
- A wedding?
- Yeah.

894
00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:58,646
I didn't think people
still get married.

895
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:01,922
It's hard today
with the men and women.

896
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,436
You're telling me.

897
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:07,123
- So they're a nice couple?
- Oh, very nice.

898
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:09,642
What does he do,
if you don't mind my asking?

899
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:11,365
- She.
- She?

900
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:15,281
She. She works, he doesn't.
He sounds like my son.

901
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:17,355
There is no "he."

902
00:52:18,007 --> 00:52:19,235
There's no he?

903
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:21,443
So who's getting married?

904
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:24,240
Two women.

905
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,920
It's...

906
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:27,440
...a lesbian wedding.

907
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:31,361
Lesbian wedding?

908
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:35,125
Yep. Yep, I'm...

909
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:37,281
...the best man.

910
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:40,960
Great.

911
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:46,560
My luck. I don't talk to a soul
on the subway for 35 years...

912
00:52:46,727 --> 00:52:49,321
...I get the best man
at a lesbian wedding.

913
00:52:49,487 --> 00:52:51,125
No, no. You don't understand.

914
00:52:51,287 --> 00:52:52,845
I'm not a lesbian!

915
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:56,044
I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian.

916
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,440
I'm really looking forward to this.

917
00:53:42,607 --> 00:53:45,360
I love weddings.
Maybe I'll meet somebody.

918
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:47,721
Maybe not.

919
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:53,559
Oh, man. We're stopping?

920
00:53:55,207 --> 00:53:58,005
Well, this is where I get off.

921
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:00,806
- You do?
- Yeah.

922
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,925
Hey, why don't you...? Oh, nothing.

923
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,515
No, no. What?

924
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:07,962
Well, I was gonna say,
"Why don't you get off with me."

925
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,038
But you're obviously very busy
on your way...

926
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:12,118
...to some important meeting
or something.

927
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,245
Yeah. Well...

928
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:16,762
See, I knew it was a bad idea.

929
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:24,566
Hey, what's another million,
give or take? I get off...

930
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,604
...when and where I wanna get off.

931
00:54:28,647 --> 00:54:30,956
I'm stuck. Could you just pull it
a little...?

932
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:32,355
This'll just be a second.

933
00:54:33,127 --> 00:54:34,480
Don't... Don't start the train!

934
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:35,841
Don't start the train!

935
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:38,795
Here it is. Here it is,
the four horse in the first race.

936
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,037
- Pappernick.
- How do you know he's gonna win?

937
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:42,765
My UPS guy. Lance.

938
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,157
The guys who own the horse are
his regular customers.

939
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:46,965
Every horse he's ever given me
has won.

940
00:54:47,127 --> 00:54:48,879
- Yeah?
- Yeah. They've been sandbagging...

941
00:54:49,047 --> 00:54:51,481
...looking for a good spot.
He's been getting in light...

942
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,764
...because they're using a bug boy.
The workouts have been unpublished.

943
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:57,202
They're ready to run with him.
Gonna break his maiden.

944
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:59,722
He's gonna go for a great price,
maybe 30-1.

945
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:02,321
- I'm telling you, it's a lock.
- But it rained last night.

946
00:55:02,487 --> 00:55:04,876
Exactly. This horse loves the slop.

947
00:55:05,047 --> 00:55:07,402
It's in his bloodlines.
His father was a mudder.

948
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:09,717
- His mother was a mudder.
- His mother was a mudder?

949
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:12,685
What did I say? Let's go to the office.
I'm gonna call my bookie.

950
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:14,326
Hey, don't tell anybody.

951
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:19,920
Oh, man.

952
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:40,079
Okay.

953
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:53,680
You realize, of course, you're naked.

954
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:57,365
Naked, dressed,
I don't see any difference.

955
00:55:57,807 --> 00:55:59,365
You ought to sit here.

956
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:00,926
There's a difference.

957
00:56:01,287 --> 00:56:04,006
You got something
against the naked body?

958
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,477
I got something against yours.

959
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:09,440
How about a couple of deep knee
bends, maybe some squat-thrusts?

960
00:56:09,607 --> 00:56:11,598
Who's got time for squat-thrusts?

961
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:14,122
All right, how about
skipping breakfast?

962
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,040
I'm guessing you're not a
"half-grapefruit and black coffee" man.

963
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,481
I like a good breakfast.

964
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:21,320
I understand.
I like a good breakfast...

965
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:24,718
...long as you don't wind up trapped
in a room in overalls and pigtails...

966
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:26,639
...being counselled by Dick Gregory.

967
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:29,277
I'm not ashamed of my body.

968
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:33,201
Exactly. That's your problem.
You should be.

969
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:35,401
Don't get up.

970
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:37,683
Please, allow me.

971
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:43,235
Oh, this is great.

972
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:45,363
This is what I need, just what I need.

973
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:48,203
Okay, tak e it easy.
I'm sure it's nothing.

974
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:50,085
Probably rats on the track.

975
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:52,124
They're stopping for rats.

976
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,480
God, it's so crowded.

977
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:56,683
How could there be
so many people?

978
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:59,278
This guy really smells.

979
00:56:59,447 --> 00:57:01,278
Doesn't anyone use deodorant
in the city?

980
00:57:01,447 --> 00:57:04,007
What is so hard?
You tak e the cap off, you roll it on.

981
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,635
What's that? I feel something
rubbing against me.

982
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:10,360
These disgusting animals.
These people should be in a cage.

983
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,755
We are in a cage.

984
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:13,676
What if I miss the wedding?

985
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,200
I got the ring. What'll they do?

986
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:17,756
You can't get married
without a ring. Oh, God...

987
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:19,925
I can't breathe.

988
00:57:20,087 --> 00:57:21,440
I feel faint.

989
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:24,405
Okay, tak e it easy.
It'll start moving soon.

990
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,400
Think about people in concentration
camps, what they went through.

991
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:30,320
And the hostages! What would
you do if you were a hostage?

992
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:33,081
Think about that. This is nothing.

993
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:35,761
No, it's not nothing, it's something.

994
00:57:35,927 --> 00:57:38,487
It's a nightmare. Help me!

995
00:57:38,647 --> 00:57:41,400
Move it! Come on!
Move this f****** thing!

996
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:42,966
Why isn't it moving?!

997
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,687
What could go wrong with a train?
It's on tracks.

998
00:57:45,847 --> 00:57:48,805
There's no traffic.
How could a train get stuck?

999
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:50,639
Step on the gas!

1000
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:53,685
What could it be? You'd think the
conductor would explain it to us.

1001
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:56,839
"I'm sorry, there's a delay.
We'll be moving in five minutes."

1002
00:57:57,007 --> 00:58:00,363
I wanna hear a v oice.
What's that on my leg?!

1003
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:11,886
Nice.

1004
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:15,321
Your company sends you
on the road often, huh?

1005
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:19,403
Nice. Oh, hey, nice ice bucket there.

1006
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:22,083
Make yourself comfortable.

1007
00:58:23,247 --> 00:58:25,203
Mak e myself comfortable?
What does that mean?

1008
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:28,404
Does she want me to tak e my clothes
off? Is she taking her clothes off?

1009
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:30,803
What if I tak e mine off
and she still has hers on?

1010
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:33,356
I'd look lik e an idiot.
She'd get offended and leave.

1011
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:35,279
So maybe I should leave them on.

1012
00:58:35,447 --> 00:58:37,802
But what if she tak es hers off?
She'll feel humiliated.

1013
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:40,556
"Mak e yourself comfortable"?
This woman's unbelievable.

1014
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:42,445
This "comfortable" thing
could ruin me.

1015
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:45,644
I got it. I'll tak e my shoes off
and sit on the bed.

1016
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:46,956
There. That's comfortable.

1017
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:49,676
She can't accuse me
of being uncomfortable.

1018
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:57,478
I gotta tell you,
I'm pretty comfortable.

1019
00:58:58,927 --> 00:59:00,076
Oh, yeah, it's all set.

1020
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:02,278
- They've got the bug boy on it.
- The bug boy?

1021
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:04,915
Yeah, the little fellow's
been riding his heart out.

1022
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,043
- They're gonna break his maiden.
- Really?

1023
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:08,606
- Yeah.
- It's a little slow out.

1024
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:10,883
- Rained last night.
- This baby loves the slop.

1025
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,005
Loves it. Eats it up.
Eats the slop. Born to slop.

1026
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,361
His father was a mudder.

1027
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:17,836
- His father was a mudder.
- His mother was a mudder.

1028
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:19,360
His mother was a mudder?

1029
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:21,036
What did I just say?

1030
00:59:22,487 --> 00:59:24,045
Hey. All right.

1031
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:26,960
Six hundred, Pappernick to win.

1032
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:31,445
They still have no pitching.
Gooden's a question mark.

1033
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:33,837
You don't recover from those
rotator cuffs so fast.

1034
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:36,202
I'm not worried about
the Mets' pitching.

1035
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:39,996
- They got no hitting.
- No, they got hitting. Bonilla, Murray.

1036
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:42,397
- They got no defence.
- Defence, please.

1037
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:45,240
- They need speed.
- Speed? They've got Coleman.

1038
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:47,477
- They need a bullpen.
- Franco's no good?

1039
00:59:47,647 --> 00:59:49,922
- They got no team leaders.
- They got Franco.

1040
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,600
What they need is a front office.

1041
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:54,122
- But you gotta like their chances.
- I love them.

1042
00:59:54,287 --> 00:59:57,677
If they win it this year, I'll sit naked
with you at the World Series.

1043
00:59:58,087 --> 00:59:59,839
It's a deal.

1044
01:00:02,327 --> 01:00:03,999
Why couldn't I tak e a cab?

1045
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:07,204
For $6, my whole life
could have changed.

1046
01:00:07,767 --> 01:00:10,565
What is that on my leg?

1047
01:00:11,447 --> 01:00:13,005
I'll never get out of here.

1048
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:16,127
What if I'm here
for the rest of my life?

1049
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:18,802
Maybe I'll get out in five seconds.

1050
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,403
One banana, two banana...

1051
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:23,762
...three banana, four banana...

1052
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:25,440
...five banana.

1053
01:00:25,807 --> 01:00:28,719
No. I'm still here.

1054
01:00:29,207 --> 01:00:32,324
Still here. When will they
start moving?

1055
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:33,840
Move!

1056
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:36,567
Move! Move!

1057
01:00:37,687 --> 01:00:39,166
It's moving.

1058
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:41,165
It's moving!

1059
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:43,200
Yes!

1060
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:44,715
Yes.

1061
01:00:46,687 --> 01:00:48,279
Mother******!

1062
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:57,042
Gee, I hope you have the key
for these things.

1063
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,161
Oh, don't worry, I do.

1064
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:02,478
My mother used to walk
around our apartment...

1065
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:03,875
...in her bra and panties.

1066
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:07,684
She didn't look anything like you.
She was...

1067
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:11,044
...really disgusting, really bad body.

1068
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:15,919
You know, if you can imagine an
uglier, fatter version of Shirley Booth.

1069
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,123
Remember Shirley Booth in Hazel?

1070
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,837
Really embarrassing,
because I had the only mother...

1071
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:23,043
...in the neighbourhood
who was worse than Hazel.

1072
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:26,199
- You can imagine the taunts I'd hear.
- Like what?

1073
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:27,766
Like:

1074
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:30,601
"Hey, your mother's
uglier than Hazel."

1075
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:33,561
"Hazel really puts your mother
to shame." You know.

1076
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,641
What's going on?

1077
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:46,004
It was a pleasure doing business
with you, but I have to get going.

1078
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:49,524
Get going? But we haven't really,
you know...

1079
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:51,166
Eight dollars?

1080
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:53,443
- Eight dollars?
- What are you doing, robbing me?

1081
01:01:53,607 --> 01:01:55,757
I wasted my whole morning
on you for $8?

1082
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,480
Wait a second. What are you doing?

1083
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:01,196
- I'm taking your clothes.
- No, no, that's my only suit!

1084
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:04,165
It cost me $350!
I got it at Moe Ginsburg!

1085
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:06,887
- Bye, George.
- You can't just leave me here.

1086
01:02:07,607 --> 01:02:09,802
Will I see you again?

1087
01:02:16,087 --> 01:02:18,157
It's Hoy's Boy followed by Jamet...

1088
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:21,125
...Little Baggit, Kiss Harmony
and then a long way to Flagrant.

1089
01:02:21,287 --> 01:02:24,006
- Come on!
- Into the stretch...

1090
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:27,284
...with an 1/8th of a mile to go,
Stepagain, Passionel battling it out.

1091
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:30,086
Clear from Jamet, Pappernick's
starting to mak e some ground...

1092
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,603
...but Stepagain is the leader...
- Come on.

1093
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:36,918
- Come on! Yes!
- Look at Pappernick, sprouting wings.

1094
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,317
- Yes! Yes!
- Stepagain, just falling back.

1095
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:41,603
- Yes!
- Pappernick flashing home.

1096
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:45,203
Stepagain, Pappernick, Pappernick
and Stepagain to the line...

1097
01:02:45,607 --> 01:02:48,997
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- The winner is Pappernick.

1098
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:52,159
Yes, yes! I won. Hey!

1099
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:00,236
Yeah.

1100
01:03:35,887 --> 01:03:38,162
I haven't had a hot dog
at Nathan's in 20 years.

1101
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:39,680
First, we ride the Cyclone.

1102
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:42,766
Chilly out.

1103
01:03:46,807 --> 01:03:48,206
French fries.

1104
01:03:54,807 --> 01:03:56,001
Hey, hey!

1105
01:03:57,447 --> 01:03:59,597
Give me the money.

1106
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:01,598
Freeze! Police!

1107
01:04:07,687 --> 01:04:09,837
No, I never got the car.
We had such a good time...

1108
01:04:10,007 --> 01:04:12,885
...by the time I got to
the police garage, it was closed.

1109
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:15,081
Too bad.

1110
01:04:15,287 --> 01:04:18,245
You wouldn't believe what this guy
put away at Nathan's.

1111
01:04:18,407 --> 01:04:20,557
Look at what we won. You want him?

1112
01:04:20,727 --> 01:04:22,080
Get that out of my face.

1113
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:26,236
So you missed the wedding.
You'll catch the bris.

1114
01:04:33,087 --> 01:04:35,885
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

1115
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:39,359
How'd you like a Hare Krishna fist
down your throat, you little punk?

1116
01:04:41,047 --> 01:04:42,480
George.

1117
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:43,841
Biff.

1118
01:04:44,407 --> 01:04:46,716
What, did you whistle
on the elevator?

1119
01:04:46,927 --> 01:04:48,883
I have my spare key
in your apartment, right?

1120
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:50,641
Yeah, in the kitchen drawer.

1121
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,445
- Give me your key.
- What happened?

1122
01:04:52,607 --> 01:04:55,758
Never mind what happened,
just give me the key.

1123
01:04:55,927 --> 01:04:58,964
- Come on, I'll go with you.
- Here. Pay.

1124
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:02,159
Wait, wait. Give me that.

1125
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:10,040
All right.

1126
01:05:11,647 --> 01:05:14,719
So I take the subway
down to Coney Island...

1127
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:17,037
...to go on the Cyclone.
I'm riding on the subway.

1128
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:20,244
I'm sitting on the D train
for an hour and 15 minutes...

1129
01:05:20,407 --> 01:05:22,875
...to go on a scary ride.

1130
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,118
Okay, how dumb is that?

1131
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:28,439
You know that first sharp drop
on the Cyclone? Fell asleep.

1132
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,638

01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,145
Women put on perfume
in an interesting way.

1134
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,508
Ever notice that, guys?

1135
01:06:25,674 --> 01:06:29,826
They have their little key,
Stratego little areas.

1136
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:37,510
Places they think we're going.

1137
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,347
And they always hit this one.

1138
01:06:41,514 --> 01:06:42,867
Women are convinced...

1139
01:06:43,034 --> 01:06:48,188
...that this is the most action-packed
area that could ever happen...

1140
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:50,310
...in the dating world.

1141
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:52,425
What is that, ladies?
What is happening here?

1142
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:55,233
Is that in case you slap the guy
or something?

1143
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:57,350
He still finds you intriguing?

1144
01:06:57,674 --> 01:07:00,393
"Oh, Chanel!"

1145
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,312
She's a pianist, a classical pianist!
She plays the piano!

1146
01:07:08,474 --> 01:07:09,987
She's a brilliant woman!

1147
01:07:10,154 --> 01:07:13,305
I sat in her living room,
she played the Waldstein Sonata.

1148
01:07:13,474 --> 01:07:15,271
The Waldstein!

1149
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:21,792
We did a crossword puzzle
together in bed.

1150
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,990
It was the most fun I ever
had in my entire life!

1151
01:07:24,154 --> 01:07:26,793
Do you hear me? In my life!

1152
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:28,992
You know?

1153
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:31,509
Were you talking?
I couldn't hear anything.

1154
01:07:33,794 --> 01:07:35,068
I was telling you about Noel.

1155
01:07:35,234 --> 01:07:37,794
Oh, Noel, yeah.
The one that plays the bongos.

1156
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:40,386
So sidesplittingly funny.

1157
01:07:41,354 --> 01:07:43,663
All right, I'm sorry. What about her?

1158
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:45,631
You think I'm gonna repeat
the whole thing?

1159
01:07:45,794 --> 01:07:48,069
You told me you like her.
Everything's going good.

1160
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:49,792
No, everything's not going good.

1161
01:07:49,954 --> 01:07:52,548
I'm very uncomfortable.
I have no power.

1162
01:07:52,714 --> 01:07:54,147
Why should she have
the upper hand?

1163
01:07:54,314 --> 01:07:57,226
For once, I'd like the upper hand.
I have no hand, no hand at all.

1164
01:07:57,394 --> 01:07:59,112
She has the hand. I have no hand.

1165
01:07:59,434 --> 01:08:01,664
- Hand me that, would you?
- Yeah.

1166
01:08:01,834 --> 01:08:03,062
How do I get the hand?

1167
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:05,748
We all want the hand.
Hand is tough to get.

1168
01:08:05,914 --> 01:08:07,870
You gotta get the hand
right from the opening.

1169
01:08:08,034 --> 01:08:11,071
She's playing a recital at
the McBierny School.

1170
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:13,589
I got two extra tickets.
You and Elaine could go.

1171
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:16,143
Yeah, that sounds like something.

1172
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:21,182
Then afterwards, maybe we could all
go out together.

1173
01:08:21,354 --> 01:08:22,992
You know, she'll see me
with my friends.

1174
01:08:23,154 --> 01:08:25,463
She'll observe me
as I really am, as myself.

1175
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,068
Maybe I can get some hand that way.

1176
01:08:29,474 --> 01:08:30,907
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

1177
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:32,712
Hey, smell my arm.

1178
01:08:34,434 --> 01:08:35,583
- What?
- Smell it. Smell it.

1179
01:08:35,754 --> 01:08:37,984
With all due respect,
I don't think so.

1180
01:08:38,154 --> 01:08:41,112
- Jerry, smell.
- That smells good. What is that?

1181
01:08:41,274 --> 01:08:43,344
- The beach.
- The beach?

1182
01:08:43,514 --> 01:08:45,027
Did you go swimming?
It's 29 degrees.

1183
01:08:45,194 --> 01:08:47,754
No, I just joined the Polar Bear Club.

1184
01:08:47,914 --> 01:08:50,382
- You joined the Polar Bears?
- What the hell's a Polar Bear?

1185
01:08:50,554 --> 01:08:53,193
These people go swimming
in the winter. They're terrific.

1186
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:55,868
I just took my first swim today.

1187
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:58,072
- It's invigorating.
- Yeah...

1188
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,384
...so is shock therapy.

1189
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:03,549
- What is that, a PEZ dispenser?
- Yeah. You want one?

1190
01:09:05,114 --> 01:09:07,264
I just bought it at the flea market.
You want one?

1191
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,902
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

1192
01:09:10,074 --> 01:09:11,302
You don't know?

1193
01:09:11,474 --> 01:09:13,863
No, I know. I know.

1194
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:16,988
You think they have fleas there,
don't you?

1195
01:09:17,634 --> 01:09:19,750
- No.
- Yes, you do, Biff.

1196
01:09:22,754 --> 01:09:25,143
You've never been,
and you think they have fleas there.

1197
01:09:25,314 --> 01:09:27,748
All right, I think they have
fleas there. So what?

1198
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,632
- Here, you want this?
- You don't want it?

1199
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:33,025
- No, I bought five of them.
- Wow, great. Thanks.

1200
01:09:35,994 --> 01:09:39,987
I don't know how anyone does this.
This must be so nerve-racking.

1201
01:09:40,154 --> 01:09:41,667
How do they warm up their fingers?

1202
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:43,984
They have a piano backstage
they warm up on.

1203
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:45,633
No. We would have heard it.

1204
01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:48,228
You think they just crack
their knuckles and come out?

1205
01:09:48,394 --> 01:09:50,783
- I told her we'd go out afterwards.
- Sure.

1206
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:54,469
Don't applaud when she stops playing
the first time. It's not over yet.

1207
01:09:54,634 --> 01:09:57,467
I really resent that.
That's directed at me, isn't it?

1208
01:10:01,354 --> 01:10:03,584
Is this okay? Can I do this?

1209
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,633
Oh, God.

1210
01:11:18,794 --> 01:11:20,546
Something I said?

1211
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:23,986
It's John Mollica.

1212
01:11:24,554 --> 01:11:28,149
Oh. Oh, John. Oh, hi, John.

1213
01:11:28,314 --> 01:11:30,623
- Hi.
- What are you doing out here?

1214
01:11:30,794 --> 01:11:32,864
I was just at this recital...

1215
01:11:33,034 --> 01:11:36,390
...and Jerry put this PEZ dispenser
on my leg...

1216
01:11:36,554 --> 01:11:39,227
...and I just started laughing.

1217
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:41,433
- Jerry's in there?
- Yeah.

1218
01:11:41,594 --> 01:11:44,825
- I heard you guys broke up.
- We did. We're just hanging out.

1219
01:11:44,994 --> 01:11:46,871
Really? Boy...

1220
01:11:47,034 --> 01:11:50,743
...you really look great.

1221
01:11:50,914 --> 01:11:53,303
Oh, thank you.

1222
01:12:02,154 --> 01:12:04,987
Hey, are you still friends
with Richie Appel?

1223
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,907
Oh, Richie? He's been doing comedy
in L.A. for a couple of years.

1224
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,826
He just got back a month ago.

1225
01:12:09,994 --> 01:12:12,713
He's kind of messed up on drugs.

1226
01:12:14,114 --> 01:12:15,342
I don't know what to do.

1227
01:12:15,514 --> 01:12:17,311
Have you thought
about an intervention?

1228
01:12:17,474 --> 01:12:20,466
- What's that?
- You get all his friends in a room...

1229
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:22,943
...and they confront him
to try to get him into rehab.

1230
01:12:23,114 --> 01:12:24,991
It's a very popular thing now.

1231
01:12:25,154 --> 01:12:27,588
Well, he'd never listen to anyone.

1232
01:12:29,314 --> 01:12:31,623
Except, of course, Jerry.

1233
01:12:31,794 --> 01:12:33,944
He'd listen to Jerry.

1234
01:12:34,114 --> 01:12:37,663
Jerry would have to be involved.

1235
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:41,622
He really respects Jerry.

1236
01:12:48,194 --> 01:12:50,867
I'm sorry, George. I'm sorry.

1237
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,668
What did you put the PEZ dispenser
on her leg for?

1238
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:57,304
- I don't know. It was an impulse.
- What kind of a sick impulse is that?

1239
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,665
How could I know she'd start to laugh?

1240
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:03,507
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am.

1241
01:13:04,394 --> 01:13:06,624
- Could we go in already?
- What are we gonna tell her?

1242
01:13:06,794 --> 01:13:09,866
- I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
- No, don't say a word.

1243
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:13,470
If she thinks my friends are jerks,
then I'm a jerk.

1244
01:13:14,074 --> 01:13:15,905
Remind me to talk to you
about something.

1245
01:13:16,074 --> 01:13:18,429
- What about?
- Hey, we're discussing something.

1246
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,550
I know, but I'm distracted now.

1247
01:13:20,714 --> 01:13:22,272
What are you, a baby?

1248
01:13:22,634 --> 01:13:23,953
All right, tell him.

1249
01:13:24,114 --> 01:13:26,753
When I was outside,
I ran into John Mollica.

1250
01:13:26,914 --> 01:13:28,393
- Really? John Mollica?
- Yeah.

1251
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:30,784
The guy that used to bartend
at the comedy club.

1252
01:13:30,954 --> 01:13:32,387
- How's he doing?
- He's good.

1253
01:13:32,554 --> 01:13:33,987
Could we cut to the chase?

1254
01:13:34,514 --> 01:13:36,027
"Cut to the chase"?

1255
01:13:37,354 --> 01:13:39,709
- Yeah.
- What are you, Joe Hollywood?

1256
01:13:41,074 --> 01:13:42,302
A lot of people say it.

1257
01:13:42,674 --> 01:13:43,868
I would lose that.

1258
01:13:44,034 --> 01:13:45,831
What's that?

1259
01:13:45,994 --> 01:13:48,144
"Lose that"? That's not
a Hollywood expression.

1260
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,465
Yes, it is.

1261
01:13:51,274 --> 01:13:53,344
Anyway...

1262
01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:56,426
So John told me that Richie
is in town from Los Angeles...

1263
01:13:56,594 --> 01:13:58,391
...and he's really
messed up on drugs.

1264
01:13:58,554 --> 01:14:00,545
So I told him
he should do an intervention.

1265
01:14:00,714 --> 01:14:03,672
- Really? An intervention?
- We got a situation over here!

1266
01:14:03,994 --> 01:14:06,872
- But he wants you to be a part of it.
- Why me?

1267
01:14:07,034 --> 01:14:10,310
He says Richie really respects you,
and he would listen to you.

1268
01:14:10,474 --> 01:14:13,352
These things are really hard to load.

1269
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:20,105
All right, okay. All right, I'm going in.

1270
01:14:20,274 --> 01:14:23,391
- We got to talk about this.
- All right.

1271
01:14:27,074 --> 01:14:29,952
Hi. Hi. Hi.

1272
01:14:30,114 --> 01:14:33,072
- You were wonderful. Wonderful.
- No, no.

1273
01:14:33,234 --> 01:14:35,509
These are my friends,
Elaine and Jerry. Noel.

1274
01:14:35,674 --> 01:14:37,153
You play a hell of a piano.

1275
01:14:38,434 --> 01:14:41,312
Yeah, I was really moved.
Really moved.

1276
01:14:41,474 --> 01:14:43,783
Didn't you hear that person laughing?

1277
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:46,752
I couldn't play. I was humiliated!

1278
01:14:46,914 --> 01:14:48,711
I'm sure it wasn't at you.

1279
01:14:48,874 --> 01:14:50,592
Well, then what was she laughing at?

1280
01:14:50,754 --> 01:14:54,144
- PEZ?
- No, thank you.

1281
01:14:54,714 --> 01:14:56,386
Did you see her?

1282
01:14:56,554 --> 01:14:58,272
Me? No, I...

1283
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:00,072
Anyone who would laugh
at a recital...

1284
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:02,350
...is probably some sort
of lunatic, anyway.

1285
01:15:02,514 --> 01:15:07,634
I mean, only a sick, twisted mind
could be that rude and ignorant.

1286
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,831
Well, you know, maybe some
mental defective...

1287
01:15:10,994 --> 01:15:13,952
...put something stupid on her leg.

1288
01:15:14,314 --> 01:15:19,263
Even if this so-called mental defective
did put something on her leg...

1289
01:15:19,434 --> 01:15:21,026
...she's still the one who laughed.

1290
01:15:21,834 --> 01:15:26,305
I'll never forget that laugh
for the rest of my life.

1291
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:31,153
I'm sure she would apologize
if she could.

1292
01:15:31,754 --> 01:15:33,790
Probably someone
is holding her back...

1293
01:15:33,954 --> 01:15:36,548
...maybe against
every fibre of her being.

1294
01:15:36,714 --> 01:15:40,229
If she wants to continue to have a fibre
of her being, she'll be very careful.

1295
01:15:40,394 --> 01:15:42,305
- Don't hit me.
- Stop it.

1296
01:15:43,834 --> 01:15:45,392
All right. So you ready?

1297
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:48,193
We'll go out,
and we'll have a bite to eat.

1298
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:51,552
I don't feel like it tonight.

1299
01:15:51,874 --> 01:15:53,592
- We'll be outside.
- Yeah.

1300
01:15:53,754 --> 01:15:54,948
It was nice meeting you.

1301
01:15:55,914 --> 01:15:59,384
By the way, how do you warm up
your fingers before you play?

1302
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:01,749
I just crack my knuckles.

1303
01:16:02,314 --> 01:16:04,350
Come on, we'll have a good time.

1304
01:16:04,514 --> 01:16:06,709
- Well, I'm really not in the mood.
- Come on...

1305
01:16:06,874 --> 01:16:10,469
I said, I don't feel like it.

1306
01:16:14,114 --> 01:16:16,867
All right...

1307
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:18,990
I'll... I'll call you.

1308
01:16:19,154 --> 01:16:22,783
I'll call you,
and we'll talk on the phone.

1309
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:26,310
Have a telephone communiqué.

1310
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:29,304
So, fine. Everything's fine.
Everything good?

1311
01:16:29,474 --> 01:16:32,705
Good. I feel good. Fine.
That's fine. That's good.

1312
01:16:32,874 --> 01:16:35,024
Okay. Okey-doke.

1313
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:43,027
You know, I think Kramer might
have been indirectly responsible...

1314
01:16:43,194 --> 01:16:44,866
...for getting Richie
involved in drugs.

1315
01:16:45,474 --> 01:16:46,827
What? How?

1316
01:16:46,994 --> 01:16:49,349
A few years ago, the comedy club
had a softball team.

1317
01:16:49,514 --> 01:16:51,152
Kramer was our first baseman.

1318
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:53,828
You couldn't get anything by him.
He was unbelievable.

1319
01:16:53,994 --> 01:16:58,749
Anyway, this one game, we came back
to win from, like, eight runs behind.

1320
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,506
So Kramer says to Richie:

1321
01:17:00,674 --> 01:17:03,905
"Why don't you dump the bucket
of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head?"

1322
01:17:04,154 --> 01:17:05,985
- The club owner.
- Yeah.

1323
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,827
So Richie goes ahead and does it.

1324
01:17:09,514 --> 01:17:11,186
- So? What happened?
- What happened?

1325
01:17:11,354 --> 01:17:13,584
The guy was, like, 67 years old.
It was freezing out.

1326
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,063
He caught a cold, developed
pneumonia, a month later...

1327
01:17:16,234 --> 01:17:19,749
...he was dead.
- Shut up.

1328
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,312
All the comedians were happy...

1329
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:24,783
...because he's one of these
club owners nobody liked.

1330
01:17:24,954 --> 01:17:26,706
But Richie was never the same.

1331
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:29,627
- What about Kramer?
- He's the same.

1332
01:17:31,594 --> 01:17:33,027
Are you sure you want me, John?

1333
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:35,992
I mean, I haven't spoken
to Richie in two years.

1334
01:17:36,154 --> 01:17:39,191
I don't have a good apartment
for an intervention.

1335
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:42,869
The furniture,
it's very nonconfrontational.

1336
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:46,151
All right, all right. Goodbye.

1337
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:47,747
Remember Richie Appel?

1338
01:17:48,074 --> 01:17:52,226
Oh, sure. The guy I told to pour the
Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?

1339
01:17:54,954 --> 01:17:57,866
Right. John Mollica is organizing
some kind of intervention for him.

1340
01:17:58,034 --> 01:17:59,353
We're having it here.

1341
01:18:00,114 --> 01:18:01,911
Can I get in on that?

1342
01:18:02,394 --> 01:18:04,954
What do you think,
it's like a poker game?

1343
01:18:05,434 --> 01:18:06,947
- Is Elaine going?
- Yeah.

1344
01:18:07,114 --> 01:18:08,866
Well, I knew him as well as she did.

1345
01:18:09,034 --> 01:18:10,387
Yeah, but John invited her.

1346
01:18:10,554 --> 01:18:12,704
So wait, you don't want me
to intervene?

1347
01:18:12,874 --> 01:18:15,513
No, intervene, go ahead.
Intervene all you want.

1348
01:18:15,674 --> 01:18:18,871
I'm just afraid you might be interfering
while we're intervening.

1349
01:18:22,554 --> 01:18:23,873
- Yeah?
- It's George.

1350
01:18:24,034 --> 01:18:25,183
Come on up.

1351
01:18:25,354 --> 01:18:28,346
Stop smelling your arm!

1352
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:30,631
You know, I got a great idea
for a cologne.

1353
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:32,227
It's called "The Beach."

1354
01:18:32,394 --> 01:18:35,511
You spray it on, and it's just like
you came home from the beach.

1355
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:38,063
A cologne that smells
like the beach.

1356
01:18:38,234 --> 01:18:42,750
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but that's not a bad idea.

1357
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:45,347
Tell me about it.

1358
01:18:45,794 --> 01:18:47,147
Why don't you call Steve D'Giff?

1359
01:18:47,314 --> 01:18:49,669
He works in the marketing department
at Calvin Klein.

1360
01:18:49,834 --> 01:18:53,383
In fact, he's a good friend
of John Mollica and Richie, also.

1361
01:18:53,554 --> 01:18:55,067
Okay.

1362
01:18:56,114 --> 01:18:58,309
Well, it's over. It's definitely over.

1363
01:18:58,794 --> 01:19:00,864
- She broke up with you?
- No, but she's going to.

1364
01:19:01,034 --> 01:19:04,390
I can sense it. We had this
terrible phone conversation.

1365
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:07,705
I was so nervous before I called,
I made a list of things to talk about.

1366
01:19:07,874 --> 01:19:09,626
What was on the list?

1367
01:19:09,794 --> 01:19:11,546
Let's see.

1368
01:19:12,234 --> 01:19:14,623
"I'm very good
at going in reverse in my car.

1369
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:19,829
Why isn't Postum
a more popular drink?"

1370
01:19:23,114 --> 01:19:26,151
Yeah, Postum is underrated.

1371
01:19:26,314 --> 01:19:28,111
Anyway, there was all this tension.

1372
01:19:28,274 --> 01:19:30,310
I asked her if she wanted
to go out to dinner...

1373
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,590
...and she said,
"No, maybe we could have lunch."

1374
01:19:32,754 --> 01:19:34,949
- You know what that means.
- What's wrong with lunch?

1375
01:19:35,114 --> 01:19:37,628
Lunch is fine at the beginning,
then you move on to dinner.

1376
01:19:37,794 --> 01:19:40,706
You don't go back to lunch.
It's like being demoted.

1377
01:19:41,034 --> 01:19:43,548
I'll never do a crossword puzzle
with her again, I know it.

1378
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:46,747
I like the jumble.
You ever do the jumble?

1379
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:48,593
I have no power, you understand?

1380
01:19:48,754 --> 01:19:50,949
I need hand! I have no hand!

1381
01:19:51,114 --> 01:19:53,184
- Why don't you break up with her.
- What?

1382
01:19:53,354 --> 01:19:55,663
Break up with her.
You reverse everything that way.

1383
01:19:56,234 --> 01:19:58,589
A preemptive breakup.

1384
01:20:00,314 --> 01:20:02,782
A preemptive breakup.

1385
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:05,947
- This is an incredible idea.
- Yeah.

1386
01:20:08,034 --> 01:20:10,070
I got nothing to lose.

1387
01:20:10,234 --> 01:20:12,270
We either break up,
which she would do anyway...

1388
01:20:12,434 --> 01:20:14,152
...but I go out with some dignity...

1389
01:20:14,314 --> 01:20:16,544
...or I completely turn the tables!

1390
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:19,548
This is absolutely brilliant!

1391
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:22,672
So I'm afraid I...

1392
01:20:22,834 --> 01:20:24,984
...am gonna have to
break up with you.

1393
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:29,829
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yes.

1394
01:20:30,314 --> 01:20:32,111
I...

1395
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:34,467
...am breaking up with you.

1396
01:20:36,034 --> 01:20:37,513
- Wow.
- Shocked?

1397
01:20:37,674 --> 01:20:40,711
- I really am.
- Never expected this, did you?

1398
01:20:40,874 --> 01:20:44,708
- I thought everything was fine.
- Well, live and learn.

1399
01:20:47,114 --> 01:20:49,548
Well, I don't understand.
You didn't enjoy being with me?

1400
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:51,750
Didn't we have fun
doing the crossword puzzle?

1401
01:20:52,274 --> 01:20:53,502
Kind of.

1402
01:20:54,274 --> 01:20:57,266
- I'm very confused.
- Well, I didn't mean to hurt you, kid.

1403
01:20:58,794 --> 01:21:00,864
- I thought...
- Now, stop it, please.

1404
01:21:01,034 --> 01:21:04,390
What do you want?
I know I can make you happy.

1405
01:21:07,594 --> 01:21:10,154
When you're playing the piano...

1406
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:12,466
...do you think about me?

1407
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,943
- I don't know.
- This is what I'm talking about.

1408
01:21:15,114 --> 01:21:17,833
Okay, I'll think about you.

1409
01:21:17,994 --> 01:21:19,427
- All the time?
- All the time?

1410
01:21:19,594 --> 01:21:22,552
- You know...
- Okay, all the time.

1411
01:21:22,714 --> 01:21:25,911
- I can't hear you.
- All the time!

1412
01:21:26,234 --> 01:21:28,828
See? It's not so hard.

1413
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:33,270
Go ahead. Smell. Smell it.

1414
01:21:34,434 --> 01:21:36,072
- Yeah? So?
- Now, you recognize it?

1415
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:37,662
I don't know.

1416
01:21:38,074 --> 01:21:39,905
The beach.

1417
01:21:40,714 --> 01:21:43,911
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, I'm talking about the beach.

1418
01:21:44,634 --> 01:21:46,545
What about it?

1419
01:21:46,714 --> 01:21:48,511
You know the way you smell...

1420
01:21:48,674 --> 01:21:52,667
...when you first come home
from the beach?

1421
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:56,509
Well, I want to make
a cologne that captures...

1422
01:21:56,674 --> 01:21:59,393
...the essence of that smell.

1423
01:21:59,834 --> 01:22:01,426
Oh, yeah.

1424
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:03,744
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

1425
01:22:03,914 --> 01:22:07,224
Whoa, wait a minute. You...

1426
01:22:07,394 --> 01:22:09,191
Did you hear what I just said?

1427
01:22:09,754 --> 01:22:12,552
You think people
are gonna pay $80 a bottle...

1428
01:22:12,714 --> 01:22:14,909
...to smell like dead fish
and seaweed?

1429
01:22:16,034 --> 01:22:18,946
That's why people take showers
when they come home from the beach.

1430
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:22,948
It's an objectionable, offensive odour.

1431
01:22:23,754 --> 01:22:26,712
So you don't think
that it's a good idea?

1432
01:22:30,674 --> 01:22:33,586
The membranes get dry,
and it just starts bleeding.

1433
01:22:34,794 --> 01:22:39,106
Since I was a kid, so I have to
stick a tissue up there.

1434
01:22:41,194 --> 01:22:42,946
You have to work like that?

1435
01:22:43,114 --> 01:22:45,469
Yeah. Nobody minds.

1436
01:22:45,954 --> 01:22:48,627
Nobody's ever said anything to me.

1437
01:22:49,034 --> 01:22:51,184
- There any ice cubes?
- Whatever's in the freezer.

1438
01:22:51,354 --> 01:22:53,106
I looked. I don't see any ice cubes.

1439
01:22:53,274 --> 01:22:55,071
Well, then I guess
there's no ice cubes.

1440
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:58,351
I can't drink this. It's warm.

1441
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:03,992
John, shouldn't we rehearse this...

1442
01:23:04,154 --> 01:23:06,065
...before Richie comes?
What's the plan?

1443
01:23:06,234 --> 01:23:07,747
Do I have to talk?
I don't want to.

1444
01:23:07,914 --> 01:23:09,825
If he's not gonna talk,
then I don't want to.

1445
01:23:09,994 --> 01:23:12,554
- No, we all have to talk!
- What's the order?

1446
01:23:12,714 --> 01:23:14,545
Alphabetical order.
You're first, Roberta.

1447
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:16,705
- Why am I first?
- Albano's your last name.

1448
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:19,104
- Not anymore. I'm divorced.
- I'll go first.

1449
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:20,866
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

1450
01:23:21,034 --> 01:23:22,911
- Is this the interference?
- Intervention.

1451
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:26,066
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, is it all right if I stay?

1452
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:28,873
He can't stay.
This is for close friends only.

1453
01:23:29,034 --> 01:23:30,228
Hey, I'm a friend.

1454
01:23:30,394 --> 01:23:33,113
Who told him to pour the Gatorade
over Marty Benson's head?

1455
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:35,105
- Oh, let him stay.
- Yeah.

1456
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:38,794
Hey, I got somebody to make up
that cologne for me, bigmouth.

1457
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:40,865
Somebody's going to make that crap?

1458
01:23:41,034 --> 01:23:43,753
- Kramer!
- Hey, you guys! All right!

1459
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:46,303
Come on in. These are some
of my Polar Bear buddies.

1460
01:23:46,474 --> 01:23:48,942
- They can't stay.
- You're having a party here?

1461
01:23:49,114 --> 01:23:50,627
No, we're having an intervention.

1462
01:23:50,794 --> 01:23:53,831
An intervention? Who's intervening?

1463
01:23:53,994 --> 01:23:56,554
He's a friend of ours on drugs,
and we're gonna confront him.

1464
01:23:56,714 --> 01:23:58,466
Sure. We used to do that...

1465
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:01,831
...when one of our Polar Bears stopped
coming. We'd go to his house:

1466
01:24:01,994 --> 01:24:04,224
"What, you don't want to be
a Polar Bear anymore?

1467
01:24:04,394 --> 01:24:07,750
- It's too cold for you?"
- It's him!

1468
01:24:07,914 --> 01:24:10,303
- What do we do?
- Hide!

1469
01:24:10,554 --> 01:24:13,830
It's not a surprise party!

1470
01:24:13,994 --> 01:24:15,188
- Yeah?
- It's George.

1471
01:24:15,354 --> 01:24:17,185
Come on up.

1472
01:24:17,354 --> 01:24:19,424
It's not him.

1473
01:24:19,594 --> 01:24:22,711
You don't wanna go out with me
because I'm a bartender, right?

1474
01:24:22,874 --> 01:24:27,743
Look, you know, I don't really think
that this is appropriate right now.

1475
01:24:27,914 --> 01:24:30,382
Is it because I have a tissue
in my nose?

1476
01:24:30,994 --> 01:24:33,792
- You're getting warm.
- Hey, we just...

1477
01:24:33,954 --> 01:24:36,229
We just came from Chadway's.
What's going on?

1478
01:24:36,394 --> 01:24:38,146
The intervention.
We're waiting for Richie.

1479
01:24:38,314 --> 01:24:42,307
Right, the intervention.
Should we leave?

1480
01:24:42,474 --> 01:24:44,783
- Well...
- Elaine, hi.

1481
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:46,467
Hi, Noel.

1482
01:24:46,634 --> 01:24:48,386
Well, you're looking well.

1483
01:24:48,554 --> 01:24:50,272
Jerry, let me tell you something.

1484
01:24:50,434 --> 01:24:53,824
A man without hand is not a man.

1485
01:24:53,994 --> 01:24:56,952
I've got so much hand,
I'm coming out of my gloves.

1486
01:24:57,114 --> 01:24:58,308
I gotta thank Kramer.

1487
01:24:58,474 --> 01:25:00,305
Even if I were dragged
through manure...

1488
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:02,146
...I still wouldn't put that stuff on.

1489
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:05,511
This man is a genius! A genius!

1490
01:25:05,674 --> 01:25:07,790
- You think so?
- I don't think so, I know so.

1491
01:25:07,954 --> 01:25:09,353
Come here. I gotta talk to you.

1492
01:25:09,514 --> 01:25:12,153
The male kangaroo
doesn't have a pouch.

1493
01:25:12,314 --> 01:25:14,350
Only the female has it...

1494
01:25:14,514 --> 01:25:17,790
...so the male has pouch envy!

1495
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,426
"Why should she have
this huge pouch and I have nothing?

1496
01:25:23,594 --> 01:25:26,267
I have things to carry too.

1497
01:25:27,714 --> 01:25:30,274
At least give me a pocket."

1498
01:25:43,594 --> 01:25:46,427
That laugh. That's the laugh.

1499
01:25:46,594 --> 01:25:49,347
- That's it! You're the one!
- No, no.

1500
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:53,348
No, it was an accident.
It wasn't my fault! It was Jerry!

1501
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:56,108
Jerry put a PEZ dispenser
on my leg!

1502
01:25:56,274 --> 01:26:00,062
You put a PEZ dispenser
on her leg during my recital?

1503
01:26:00,234 --> 01:26:02,464
- I didn't know she would laugh.
- And, you...

1504
01:26:02,634 --> 01:26:04,864
You lied to me, George.
You lied to me!

1505
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:08,629
No, l... I didn't. What did I do?

1506
01:26:10,074 --> 01:26:11,427
Where are you going?

1507
01:26:12,554 --> 01:26:16,866
I am breaking up with you.

1508
01:26:17,474 --> 01:26:20,227
You can't break up with me.
I've got hand!

1509
01:26:20,714 --> 01:26:23,353
And you're gonna need it.

1510
01:26:26,394 --> 01:26:28,624
Noel!

1511
01:26:29,714 --> 01:26:32,865
- Hey, Richie!
- Hey, Richie.

1512
01:26:33,274 --> 01:26:34,627
So, what's going on?

1513
01:26:35,514 --> 01:26:39,268
So we start the intervention,
and it's pretty ugly from the get-go.

1514
01:26:39,434 --> 01:26:42,870
He's not listening, he's hostile,
he's talking back.

1515
01:26:43,034 --> 01:26:45,343
I can't do these puzzles.

1516
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:47,266
So he starts to get up.

1517
01:26:47,434 --> 01:26:51,268
Suddenly, he spots the PEZ dispenser
on the coffee table.

1518
01:26:51,434 --> 01:26:53,504
The PEZ dispenser.

1519
01:26:53,674 --> 01:26:56,142
He picks it up, he's staring at it.

1520
01:26:56,314 --> 01:26:58,225
It's like he's hypnotized by it.

1521
01:26:58,394 --> 01:27:01,033
Then he's telling us this story
about how when he was a kid...

1522
01:27:01,194 --> 01:27:02,866
...he was in the car
with his father...

1523
01:27:03,034 --> 01:27:05,184
...and his father was trying
to load one of them.

1524
01:27:05,354 --> 01:27:08,949
- Well, they're hard to load.
- Tell me something I don't know.

1525
01:27:10,154 --> 01:27:14,033
So as the father's trying to load it,
he loses control of the car...

1526
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:16,344
...crashes into a high school cafeteria.

1527
01:27:16,514 --> 01:27:17,993
- Get out.
- Nobody's hurt...

1528
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:20,622
...but PEZ was all over the car.

1529
01:27:20,794 --> 01:27:22,546
And the dispenser was destroyed...

1530
01:27:22,714 --> 01:27:24,466
...virtually beyond recognition.

1531
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:28,345
- Poor kid.
- So as he's telling the story...

1532
01:27:28,514 --> 01:27:29,503
...he starts crying.

1533
01:27:29,794 --> 01:27:31,307
- What did you do?
- What do you think?

1534
01:27:31,474 --> 01:27:34,193
- I gave him my PEZ dispenser.
- Wow.

1535
01:27:34,354 --> 01:27:37,187
Two hours later,
he checks into Smither's clinic.

1536
01:27:37,354 --> 01:27:40,232
Talked to the doctor yesterday.
He's doing great on the rehab...

1537
01:27:40,394 --> 01:27:42,669
...he's hooked on PEZ.

1538
01:27:45,274 --> 01:27:47,026
He's eating them
like there's no tomorrow.

1539
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:49,789
What's a three-letter word for candy?

1540
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:54,149
I can't do those things.

1541
01:28:05,674 --> 01:28:09,144
Jawbreakers, to me, was like
the ultimate challenge candy.

1542
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:12,545
It was like candy manufacturers were
sitting in their laboratories, going:

1543
01:28:12,714 --> 01:28:14,750
"I wonder if they'll eat this.

1544
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:17,348
This seems pretty tough to eat.

1545
01:28:17,514 --> 01:28:19,903
Let's market it
as some sort of experiment."

1546
01:28:20,074 --> 01:28:22,463
But the concept of Jawbreakers...
What was the concept?

1547
01:28:22,634 --> 01:28:25,148
Multicoloured cement balls
for a quarter?

1548
01:28:25,314 --> 01:28:26,952
Was that the idea behind it?

1549
01:28:27,114 --> 01:28:29,469
"Let's see if we can hurt them.

1550
01:28:29,634 --> 01:28:32,467
Let's see if they'll pay to be hurt."

1551
01:28:32,634 --> 01:28:34,306
This is the idea behind Jawbreakers.

1552
01:28:34,474 --> 01:28:35,987
I did it, I ate them, I loved them.

1553
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:40,748
"Oh, this is very painful.
I'm really hurting.

1554
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:43,747
And this is hurting me a lot.
I love them."

1555
01:28:48,314 --> 01:28:49,303

At the health club,
people are working out...

1557
01:28:56,989 --> 01:28:58,866
...and they're training,
getting in shape...

1558
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:02,908
...but strangely, nobody's really
getting in shape for anything.

1559
01:29:03,069 --> 01:29:05,788
The only reason that you're
getting in shape...

1560
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:08,463
...is that so you can get through
the workout.

1561
01:29:09,749 --> 01:29:11,785
So we're working out...

1562
01:29:11,949 --> 01:29:16,261
...so that we'll be in shape
for when we have to do our exercise.

1563
01:29:16,749 --> 01:29:18,262
This is the whole thing.

1564
01:29:18,429 --> 01:29:21,023
The other thing I don't get
is why we're so careful...

1565
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:25,148
...about locking up our dirty towels
and smelly jockstraps.

1566
01:29:25,749 --> 01:29:31,699
What exactly is the black market
on these disgusting gym clothes?

1567
01:29:31,869 --> 01:29:34,224
I'll give my car to any guy
in front of a restaurant...

1568
01:29:34,389 --> 01:29:36,664
...because he's got a short
red jacket.

1569
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:38,228
"He must be the valet guy."

1570
01:29:38,389 --> 01:29:40,664
But my stinking,
putrefied gym clothes...

1571
01:29:40,829 --> 01:29:42,581
...I got one of these locks...

1572
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:45,388
...you could put a bullet through it
and it won't open.

1573
01:29:45,549 --> 01:29:47,028
That stuff is safe.

1574
01:29:52,749 --> 01:29:55,138
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.

1575
01:29:55,309 --> 01:29:57,265
I had three inches on that guy.

1576
01:29:57,429 --> 01:29:58,987
See, you two were hogging the ball.

1577
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:01,265
Me? It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.

1578
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:02,703
All you do is dribble.

1579
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:06,179
I have to dribble. If I give it to you,
you just shoot. You're a chucker.

1580
01:30:06,349 --> 01:30:07,748
- Oh, I'm a chucker.
- That's right.

1581
01:30:07,909 --> 01:30:09,627
Every time you get the ball,
you shoot.

1582
01:30:09,789 --> 01:30:11,017
I can't believe you
called me a chucker.

1583
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:13,623
No way I'm a chucker! I do not chuck.
Never chuck!

1584
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:16,508
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck! No chuck!

1585
01:30:17,389 --> 01:30:18,902
You chuck.

1586
01:30:19,629 --> 01:30:22,382
- Kramer, am I a chucker?
- Oh, you're a chucker.

1587
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:25,546
My God, I'm a chucker.

1588
01:30:25,709 --> 01:30:30,180
- All these years, you never told me?
- It's not an easy thing to bring up.

1589
01:30:31,669 --> 01:30:34,900
Hey, you know, this is the first time
we ever saw each other naked?

1590
01:30:37,709 --> 01:30:39,461
Believe me, I didn't see anything.

1591
01:30:39,629 --> 01:30:41,347
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?

1592
01:30:42,189 --> 01:30:44,623
- No. Did you?
- Yeah, I snuck a peek.

1593
01:30:44,789 --> 01:30:46,984
- Why?
- Why not?

1594
01:30:47,149 --> 01:30:48,468
What about you, George?

1595
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:51,548
Yeah, I...

1596
01:30:52,669 --> 01:30:54,227
...snuck a peek.

1597
01:30:54,389 --> 01:30:57,779
But it was so fast, I didn't see
anything. It was just a blur.

1598
01:30:57,949 --> 01:30:59,541
I made a conscious effort not to look.

1599
01:30:59,709 --> 01:31:01,939
There's certain information
I just don't wanna have.

1600
01:31:02,509 --> 01:31:03,988
Okay...

1601
01:31:04,509 --> 01:31:06,147
I gotta go meet Newman.

1602
01:31:06,749 --> 01:31:09,388
- I'll see you later. Have a good one.
- All right.

1603
01:31:10,189 --> 01:31:11,383
Yeah.

1604
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:15,188
Look at this guy.

1605
01:31:15,869 --> 01:31:18,337
Does he have to stretch in here?

1606
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:20,577
- You know who that is?
- Who?

1607
01:31:20,749 --> 01:31:22,262
That's Keith Hernandez.

1608
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:25,544
Keith Hernandez,
the baseball player?

1609
01:31:25,949 --> 01:31:27,780
Yeah, that's him.

1610
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:30,224
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1611
01:31:30,389 --> 01:31:33,142
Wow! Keith Hernandez!

1612
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:35,027
- He's such a great player.
- Yeah.

1613
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:37,384
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.

1614
01:31:37,549 --> 01:31:40,188
Wow, I'd love to be a Civil War buff.

1615
01:31:42,389 --> 01:31:44,744
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

1616
01:31:45,549 --> 01:31:47,585
So Biff wants to be a buff?

1617
01:31:48,109 --> 01:31:50,577
Well, sleeping less than 18 hours
a day would be a start.

1618
01:31:54,029 --> 01:31:55,940
I only got two weeks left
of unemployment.

1619
01:31:56,109 --> 01:31:58,987
I gotta prove I've been looking
for a job to get an extension.

1620
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:01,302
Hey, should we say something
to him?

1621
01:32:01,469 --> 01:32:04,142
Oh, I'm sure he loves to hear
from fans in the locker room.

1622
01:32:04,309 --> 01:32:06,504
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.

1623
01:32:07,269 --> 01:32:09,066
He's Keith Hernandez.

1624
01:32:09,229 --> 01:32:11,299
You're Jerry Seinfeld.

1625
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:18,660
- So?
- What, you're comparing yourself...

1626
01:32:18,829 --> 01:32:20,148
...to Keith Hernandez?

1627
01:32:20,309 --> 01:32:22,948
The guy's a baseball player,
Jerry, baseball!

1628
01:32:23,109 --> 01:32:25,862
I know what he is. I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.

1629
01:32:26,029 --> 01:32:28,907
What, you're making some wisecracks
in a nightclub?

1630
01:32:30,549 --> 01:32:35,065
The guy was in game six, two runs
down, two outs, facing elimination!

1631
01:32:35,229 --> 01:32:36,423
Excuse me.

1632
01:32:36,589 --> 01:32:38,659
I don't want to disturb you.
I'm Keith Hernandez.

1633
01:32:38,829 --> 01:32:41,946
And I just want to tell you what
a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

1634
01:32:47,149 --> 01:32:49,299
- Really?
- I've always wanted to do what you do.

1635
01:32:49,469 --> 01:32:52,427
Do what I do?! You're one
of my favorite ballplayers of all time!

1636
01:32:52,589 --> 01:32:53,863
Mine too.

1637
01:32:55,789 --> 01:32:58,747
- I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
- Really?

1638
01:32:59,229 --> 01:33:00,867
Thank you.

1639
01:33:01,949 --> 01:33:03,985
You know, Keith,
what I've always wondered is...

1640
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:06,743
...with all these ball clubs
flying around all season...

1641
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:09,469
...wouldn't you think
there'd be a plane crash?

1642
01:33:14,629 --> 01:33:16,267
Are you performing in New York now?

1643
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:18,545
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.

1644
01:33:18,709 --> 01:33:21,826
But think about it:
26 teams, 162 games a season.

1645
01:33:21,989 --> 01:33:25,379
You'd think eventually, an entire team
would just get wiped out.

1646
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:29,943
I live on the East Side.

1647
01:33:30,109 --> 01:33:31,303
I'll give you my number...

1648
01:33:31,469 --> 01:33:33,380
...and just tell me whenever
you want to go.

1649
01:33:33,549 --> 01:33:36,188
- Or maybe just get together for coffee.
- Oh, that'd be great.

1650
01:33:37,109 --> 01:33:39,543
Well, it's only a matter of time.

1651
01:33:40,549 --> 01:33:42,267
Who's this chucker?

1652
01:33:47,389 --> 01:33:49,949
It's been three days,
and he hasn't called.

1653
01:33:50,229 --> 01:33:51,628
Well, maybe you should call him.

1654
01:33:51,789 --> 01:33:53,381
I can't. I can't.

1655
01:33:53,549 --> 01:33:57,064
- Why not?
- I just feel like he should call me.

1656
01:33:57,229 --> 01:33:58,457
What's the difference?

1657
01:33:58,629 --> 01:34:01,382
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.

1658
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:05,224
If he wants to see me,
he has my number. He should call.

1659
01:34:07,229 --> 01:34:10,665
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.

1660
01:34:11,429 --> 01:34:12,782
I can't stand these guys.

1661
01:34:12,949 --> 01:34:15,543
You give your number to them,
and then they don't call.

1662
01:34:16,909 --> 01:34:18,342
Why do they do that?

1663
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:20,627
I'm sorry, honey.

1664
01:34:22,429 --> 01:34:25,387
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.

1665
01:34:25,549 --> 01:34:27,540
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.

1666
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:30,428
- I know.
- Why did he come over to me?

1667
01:34:30,589 --> 01:34:33,626
I mean, here I meet this great guy,
this ballplayer...

1668
01:34:33,789 --> 01:34:35,700
...best guy I ever met.
- Yeah. I know.

1669
01:34:35,869 --> 01:34:39,828
Well, that's it. I'm never giving
my number out to another guy again.

1670
01:34:39,989 --> 01:34:43,982
I've given my number out to guys,
and it takes them a month to call.

1671
01:34:45,229 --> 01:34:47,618
Good. Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month...

1672
01:34:47,789 --> 01:34:49,620
...he's got a prayer.

1673
01:34:51,669 --> 01:34:54,502
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.

1674
01:34:54,669 --> 01:34:56,819
Oh, what, they don't have phones
out of town?

1675
01:34:57,349 --> 01:34:59,783
I love how people say
they're too busy. "Too busy."

1676
01:34:59,949 --> 01:35:01,940
Pick up a phone!

1677
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:04,748
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

1678
01:35:05,229 --> 01:35:09,302
- Why don't you just go and call him?
- I can't call here. It's a coffee shop.

1679
01:35:09,469 --> 01:35:12,984
- I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
- Just ask if he wants to get together.

1680
01:35:13,469 --> 01:35:14,982
For what, dinner?

1681
01:35:16,069 --> 01:35:17,548
Dinner's good.

1682
01:35:18,069 --> 01:35:22,347
Don't you think that's coming on a little
too strong? Isn't that, like, a turnoff?

1683
01:35:22,749 --> 01:35:25,058
Jerry, he's a guy.

1684
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:29,425
I know, but this is all very confusing.

1685
01:35:29,789 --> 01:35:33,065
When you're in your 30s,
it's very hard to make a new friend.

1686
01:35:33,229 --> 01:35:36,266
Whatever the group is you've got now,
that's who you're going with.

1687
01:35:36,429 --> 01:35:38,943
You're not interviewing,
not looking at any new people.

1688
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:42,181
You're not interested in seeing
any applications.

1689
01:35:42,349 --> 01:35:44,817
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.

1690
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,547
They don't know the activities.

1691
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:49,940
If I meet a guy at a club or a gym:
"Hey, look, I'm sure you're very nice.

1692
01:35:50,109 --> 01:35:53,306
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now."

1693
01:35:53,469 --> 01:35:54,584
When you're a kid...

1694
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:57,900
...you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid...

1695
01:35:58,069 --> 01:36:01,141
...what are the qualifications? " If
someone's in front of my house...

1696
01:36:01,309 --> 01:36:03,698
...that's my friend.
They're my friend. That's it.

1697
01:36:03,869 --> 01:36:06,508
Are you a grownup?
No? Great. Come on in!

1698
01:36:06,669 --> 01:36:10,025
Let's jump up and down on my bed!"
And if you have anything in common:

1699
01:36:10,189 --> 01:36:13,625
"You like cherry soda? I like
cherry soda! We'll be best friends!"

1700
01:36:19,229 --> 01:36:22,221
You only have two more weeks
before your benefits run out.

1701
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:25,303
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps,
to get...

1702
01:36:25,469 --> 01:36:27,824
...a 13-week extension,
if that's possible.

1703
01:36:28,189 --> 01:36:30,225
So where have you been looking
for work?

1704
01:36:30,389 --> 01:36:32,141
You know what I've discovered,
Mrs. Sokol?

1705
01:36:32,509 --> 01:36:34,386
It's not so much the looking...

1706
01:36:34,549 --> 01:36:35,698
...as the listening.

1707
01:36:35,869 --> 01:36:38,702
I listen for work.
As I'm looking...

1708
01:36:38,869 --> 01:36:41,702
...and listening... I'm also looking.
You cannot discount looking.

1709
01:36:41,869 --> 01:36:43,780
It's a combination.
It's looking. And listening.

1710
01:36:43,949 --> 01:36:47,180
Listening. And looking.
But you must look.

1711
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:49,544
Can you be specific
about any of these companies?

1712
01:36:49,749 --> 01:36:51,819
Specific. Let's see...

1713
01:36:51,989 --> 01:36:53,900
I've walked in and out
of so many buildings.

1714
01:36:54,069 --> 01:36:55,468
They all blend in together.

1715
01:36:55,629 --> 01:36:57,142
Just give me one name.

1716
01:36:57,629 --> 01:36:59,142
One name. Absolutely.

1717
01:37:00,069 --> 01:37:01,661
Let's see, there's...

1718
01:37:01,829 --> 01:37:03,023
Vandalay Industries.

1719
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:05,578
I just saw them. I got very close there.
Very close.

1720
01:37:05,749 --> 01:37:07,660
What type of company is that?

1721
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:10,100
Latex. Latex manufacturing,
Mrs. Sokol.

1722
01:37:10,829 --> 01:37:14,219
- And you interviewed there?
- Yes, for a sales position.

1723
01:37:14,389 --> 01:37:15,742
Latex salesman.

1724
01:37:15,909 --> 01:37:19,663
The selling of latex
and latex-related products.

1725
01:37:20,829 --> 01:37:22,820
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!

1726
01:37:22,989 --> 01:37:26,220
Now I'm going to need an address
and a phone number for this...

1727
01:37:26,389 --> 01:37:27,538
...Vandalay company.

1728
01:37:28,029 --> 01:37:29,462
You like gum?

1729
01:37:29,629 --> 01:37:32,780
Because I have a friend in the gum
business. I got a gum guy!

1730
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:35,907
I make one phone call, have boxes
of gum delivered right to your door.

1731
01:37:36,069 --> 01:37:37,661
The address?

1732
01:37:39,029 --> 01:37:40,701
The address is...

1733
01:37:43,469 --> 01:37:45,460
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?

1734
01:37:46,469 --> 01:37:49,347
- No.
- Jose Jimenez.

1735
01:37:50,509 --> 01:37:52,784
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.

1736
01:37:52,949 --> 01:37:54,587
The address.

1737
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:58,906
Vandalay is...

1738
01:37:59,069 --> 01:38:02,618
...129 West 81 st Street.
It's a very small industry, Vandalay.

1739
01:38:02,789 --> 01:38:04,541
It's why I wanted
to work for them.

1740
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:06,540
A phone number.

1741
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:09,303
That's... KL5...

1742
01:38:09,869 --> 01:38:11,905
...8383. Are you planning on
calling them soon?

1743
01:38:12,069 --> 01:38:14,219
Because they have
very strange hours.

1744
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:15,617
As soon as I'm done with you.

1745
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:18,347
Sure. Well...

1746
01:38:18,509 --> 01:38:20,659
You know, I'll check in with you
next week.

1747
01:38:20,829 --> 01:38:24,344
I gotta run now because
I got a full plate this afternoon.

1748
01:38:24,509 --> 01:38:28,297
- Okay.
- All right. Really good to...

1749
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:35,218
He'll call you back!

1750
01:38:35,389 --> 01:38:36,708
It's a par five.

1751
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,507
So, you know, I step up to the tee...

1752
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:41,979
...and I hit a beautiful drive
right down the middle of the fairway.

1753
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:44,504
- I mean, you know my hook, right?
- Elaine?

1754
01:38:44,909 --> 01:38:46,422
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?

1755
01:38:51,989 --> 01:38:54,344
Jerry, he's a guy.

1756
01:38:56,309 --> 01:38:58,777
Well, it's a dogleg left,
so I play the hook.

1757
01:38:58,949 --> 01:39:01,179
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.

1758
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:03,861
- Jerry! Jerry!
- George?

1759
01:39:04,029 --> 01:39:06,418
- Kramer, put Jerry on!
- I'm in the middle of something.

1760
01:39:06,589 --> 01:39:08,819
- Call back.
- Kramer, no...!

1761
01:39:09,029 --> 01:39:11,497
So the ball takes off,
and I'm waiting for it to turn.

1762
01:39:18,789 --> 01:39:20,017
Would you...!

1763
01:39:22,509 --> 01:39:24,977
All right. Well, I'll talk to Jerry.
Yeah.

1764
01:39:26,189 --> 01:39:27,668
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.

1765
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:29,706
She's wondering when
we'll go see the baby.

1766
01:39:29,869 --> 01:39:32,827
- See the baby. Again with the baby.
- Who are they?

1767
01:39:33,029 --> 01:39:36,101
A guy who used to live in the building
keeps calling us to see the baby.

1768
01:39:36,269 --> 01:39:39,386
"You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby?"

1769
01:39:39,549 --> 01:39:41,028
Can't they just send us a tape?

1770
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:43,749
Maybe if you wait a few months,
it won't be a baby anymore.

1771
01:39:43,909 --> 01:39:46,582
- Then you won't have to see it.
- Because he'll be all grown-up.

1772
01:39:46,749 --> 01:39:48,023
Yeah...

1773
01:39:49,389 --> 01:39:51,664
Hey, Kramer, what do you think
of this shirt?

1774
01:39:57,189 --> 01:39:58,383
It's too busy.

1775
01:39:58,549 --> 01:40:00,779
You're trying too hard
to make an impression on him.

1776
01:40:00,949 --> 01:40:03,144
- You're not being yourself.
- What guy?

1777
01:40:03,309 --> 01:40:06,699
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

1778
01:40:07,389 --> 01:40:09,266
Who are you talking about?

1779
01:40:10,109 --> 01:40:11,861
Keith... Hernandez.

1780
01:40:12,029 --> 01:40:13,906
Keith Hernandez?

1781
01:40:14,549 --> 01:40:16,665
Keith Hernandez!

1782
01:40:18,109 --> 01:40:20,339
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?

1783
01:40:20,509 --> 01:40:22,545
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.

1784
01:40:22,709 --> 01:40:25,382
They're all double-parked.
Get out, I'm begging you.

1785
01:40:25,549 --> 01:40:26,743
Please. Please!

1786
01:40:31,829 --> 01:40:33,148
You know what?

1787
01:40:33,749 --> 01:40:34,898
Bad mistake. My mistake.

1788
01:40:35,069 --> 01:40:37,264
Go back. Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.

1789
01:40:37,429 --> 01:40:40,307
This lane stinks. Go back to your lane.
Go ahead. Bad mistake.

1790
01:40:40,669 --> 01:40:44,139
Go! Go! Go! Make this light!
Make this light! Oh, man!

1791
01:40:44,509 --> 01:40:46,147
That's it! Get out!

1792
01:40:46,309 --> 01:40:48,345
- What do you mean, get out?
- Get out of the cab!

1793
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:50,181
What? I'm not getting out of this cab.

1794
01:40:50,349 --> 01:40:53,227
No! No! You cannot throw me out!

1795
01:40:53,389 --> 01:40:55,619
No! Get...

1796
01:40:55,789 --> 01:40:57,461
Hello, Newman.

1797
01:40:57,629 --> 01:40:58,857
I hate Keith Hernandez.

1798
01:40:59,029 --> 01:41:01,748
- Hate him!
- I despise him.

1799
01:41:01,909 --> 01:41:03,945
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you why.

1800
01:41:04,109 --> 01:41:05,508
- Let me tell her.
- No, you can't...

1801
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:07,341
- You always tell.
- All right, tell it.

1802
01:41:07,509 --> 01:41:09,465
- Just tell it.
- All right.

1803
01:41:10,629 --> 01:41:14,019
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

1804
01:41:14,189 --> 01:41:17,306
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

1805
01:41:17,469 --> 01:41:19,664
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

1806
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:22,787
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

1807
01:41:22,949 --> 01:41:25,747
Our day was ruined.

1808
01:41:26,069 --> 01:41:28,981
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

1809
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:30,582
Now we're coming down the ramp.

1810
01:41:30,749 --> 01:41:32,467
Newman was in front of me.

1811
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:34,585
Hernandez was coming toward us.

1812
01:41:34,749 --> 01:41:39,698
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, "Nice game, pretty boy."

1813
01:41:42,149 --> 01:41:44,379
Hernandez continued past us
up the ramp.

1814
01:41:44,549 --> 01:41:47,541
Then, a second later,
something happened...

1815
01:41:47,709 --> 01:41:51,418
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

1816
01:41:51,589 --> 01:41:53,307
...from that day forward.

1817
01:41:53,549 --> 01:41:55,540
- What was it?
- He spit on us!

1818
01:41:57,909 --> 01:42:00,264
And I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

1819
01:42:01,709 --> 01:42:06,066
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

1820
01:42:08,909 --> 01:42:10,501
What a story.

1821
01:42:10,669 --> 01:42:13,308
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

1822
01:42:13,469 --> 01:42:15,699
...the whole premise of your account.

1823
01:42:15,869 --> 01:42:18,429
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

1824
01:42:18,589 --> 01:42:21,057
...as I've heard this story
a number of times.

1825
01:42:21,229 --> 01:42:24,062
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

1826
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:26,540
According to your story...

1827
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:29,587
...Hernandez passes you
and starts walking up the ramp.

1828
01:42:29,749 --> 01:42:31,979
Then you say you were struck...

1829
01:42:32,709 --> 01:42:34,381
...on the right temple.

1830
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:37,823
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

1831
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:41,902
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the fourth rib.

1832
01:42:44,509 --> 01:42:46,181
The spit then came off the rib...

1833
01:42:46,349 --> 01:42:49,546
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

1834
01:42:51,069 --> 01:42:53,378
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

1835
01:42:55,349 --> 01:42:58,386
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

1836
01:42:58,549 --> 01:43:00,505
...in midair, mind you...

1837
01:43:01,789 --> 01:43:06,419
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

1838
01:43:08,309 --> 01:43:11,346
That is one magic loogie.

1839
01:43:19,229 --> 01:43:21,106
Well, that's the way it happened.

1840
01:43:21,829 --> 01:43:24,059
What happened to your head
when you got hit?

1841
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:25,947
Well, my head...

1842
01:43:26,109 --> 01:43:27,861
...went back, to the left.

1843
01:43:28,029 --> 01:43:30,543
- Say that again.
- Back and to the left.

1844
01:43:31,269 --> 01:43:33,260
Back and to the left.

1845
01:43:34,269 --> 01:43:37,102
Back and to the left.

1846
01:43:37,709 --> 01:43:39,028
So, what are you saying?

1847
01:43:39,189 --> 01:43:40,827
I'm saying...

1848
01:43:40,989 --> 01:43:44,459
...that the spit could not have
come from behind.

1849
01:43:45,509 --> 01:43:47,818
That there had to have been
a second spitter.

1850
01:43:55,589 --> 01:43:57,705
Behind the bushes,
on the gravelly road.

1851
01:43:58,429 --> 01:44:00,659
If the spitter was behind you,
as you claim...

1852
01:44:00,829 --> 01:44:04,299
...that would've caused your head
to pitch forward.

1853
01:44:05,309 --> 01:44:09,097
So the spit could've only come
from the front and to the right.

1854
01:44:09,269 --> 01:44:12,181
But that's not what they
would have you believe.

1855
01:44:13,429 --> 01:44:14,862
I'm leaving.

1856
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:16,498
Jerry's a nut.

1857
01:44:17,629 --> 01:44:19,028
Wait, wait, wait.

1858
01:44:19,549 --> 01:44:22,586
The sad thing is,
we may never know the real truth.

1859
01:44:29,629 --> 01:44:31,824
Did anybody call
asking for Vandalay Industries?

1860
01:44:31,989 --> 01:44:34,742
- No, what happened to you?
- All right, listen closely:

1861
01:44:34,909 --> 01:44:37,139
I was at the unemployment office.

1862
01:44:37,309 --> 01:44:40,506
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandalay Industries...

1863
01:44:40,669 --> 01:44:43,388
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

1864
01:44:43,549 --> 01:44:45,938
...you have to answer,
"Vandalay Industries."

1865
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:48,304
- I'm Vandalay Industries?
- Right.

1866
01:44:48,469 --> 01:44:50,585
- What is that?
- You're in latex.

1867
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:52,307
- Latex?
- Right.

1868
01:44:52,469 --> 01:44:55,142
- What do I do with latex?
- I don't know! You manufacture it!

1869
01:44:55,389 --> 01:44:59,223
- Right here in this little apartment?
- And what do I say about you?

1870
01:44:59,389 --> 01:45:01,698
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

1871
01:45:02,189 --> 01:45:04,703
- I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
- Right.

1872
01:45:04,869 --> 01:45:07,383
I don't think so.

1873
01:45:08,949 --> 01:45:10,621
Why would I do that?

1874
01:45:10,789 --> 01:45:13,223
Because I asked you to.

1875
01:45:13,389 --> 01:45:15,539
If you think I'm looking for someone
to just sit...

1876
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:18,587
...pushing papers around,
you can forget it.

1877
01:45:18,749 --> 01:45:21,582
I've got enough headaches
just trying to manufacture the stuff.

1878
01:45:24,469 --> 01:45:26,107
- Yeah?
- It's Keith.

1879
01:45:26,269 --> 01:45:27,588
All right, we're coming down.

1880
01:45:27,749 --> 01:45:29,023
Keith Hernandez?

1881
01:45:29,189 --> 01:45:31,578
- Yeah. Come on, Elaine, let's go.
- Where are you going?

1882
01:45:31,749 --> 01:45:33,307
They're giving me a ride downtown.

1883
01:45:33,469 --> 01:45:36,188
You know, there had to have been
a second spitter. Who was it?

1884
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:37,498
Who had the motive?

1885
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:40,741
That's what I've been trying
to figure out the past five years.

1886
01:45:40,909 --> 01:45:42,820
What the hell are you two
talking about?

1887
01:45:44,509 --> 01:45:46,898
- That was really fun. Thanks.
- Yeah, it really was.

1888
01:45:47,829 --> 01:45:49,501
Should I shak e his hand?

1889
01:45:50,589 --> 01:45:51,988
Well...

1890
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:53,821
You want to catch a movie
this weekend?

1891
01:45:53,989 --> 01:45:55,980
Have you seen JFK?

1892
01:45:57,629 --> 01:45:59,221
No, I haven't.

1893
01:46:00,029 --> 01:46:01,940
This week end. Wow!

1894
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:04,665
Sure. That would be great.

1895
01:46:05,309 --> 01:46:08,824
Damn. I was too overanxious.
He must have noticed that.

1896
01:46:09,629 --> 01:46:11,062
I mean, if you want to.

1897
01:46:11,229 --> 01:46:14,062
- Well, how about this Friday?
- Yeah, Friday's okay.

1898
01:46:15,029 --> 01:46:17,668
Go ahead, shak e his hand.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

1899
01:46:17,829 --> 01:46:19,865
I've been on The Tonight Show.

1900
01:46:21,069 --> 01:46:23,060
Well, good night.

1901
01:46:23,229 --> 01:46:24,503
Good night.

1902
01:46:24,829 --> 01:46:26,706
Oh, Jer, by the way...

1903
01:46:26,869 --> 01:46:28,621
...the woman we gave
a ride to earlier...

1904
01:46:28,829 --> 01:46:29,978
- Elaine.
- Yeah.

1905
01:46:30,189 --> 01:46:32,783
- What's her story?
- I don't know. We used to go out.

1906
01:46:33,389 --> 01:46:36,028
Would you mind if I gave her a call?

1907
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:38,544
- For a date?
- Yeah.

1908
01:46:38,709 --> 01:46:40,301
Oh, no...

1909
01:46:40,469 --> 01:46:42,061
Go ahead.

1910
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:43,708
You got a pen?

1911
01:46:43,869 --> 01:46:45,222
You sure you don't mind?

1912
01:46:55,829 --> 01:46:57,148
So then we went to dinner.

1913
01:46:57,309 --> 01:46:59,061
- Who paid?
- We split it.

1914
01:46:59,229 --> 01:47:00,662
Split it. Pretty good.

1915
01:47:00,949 --> 01:47:04,100
- Did you talk about game six?
- No. I gotta wait until it's the right time.

1916
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:08,903
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

1917
01:47:09,069 --> 01:47:10,422
Come on up.

1918
01:47:10,589 --> 01:47:11,988
So then what?

1919
01:47:12,589 --> 01:47:14,102
Nothing. Then he took me home.

1920
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:16,181
Shake his hand?

1921
01:47:17,469 --> 01:47:18,822
Yeah.

1922
01:47:18,989 --> 01:47:20,820
What kind of a shake does he have?

1923
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:22,583
Good shake. Perfect shake.

1924
01:47:22,749 --> 01:47:24,899
Single pump, not too hard.

1925
01:47:25,069 --> 01:47:29,108
Didn't have to prove anything,
but firm enough to know he was there.

1926
01:47:29,269 --> 01:47:31,021
So...

1927
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:33,145
...you're gonna see him again?

1928
01:47:35,349 --> 01:47:37,624
He asked me if I was doing anything
Friday night.

1929
01:47:38,589 --> 01:47:40,386
The weekend!

1930
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,098
So then, as I was getting out
of the car...

1931
01:47:44,269 --> 01:47:45,622
- Hi!
- Oh, hi, Elaine.

1932
01:47:45,789 --> 01:47:46,983
Hi, Elaine.

1933
01:47:47,149 --> 01:47:48,980
So how was your date?

1934
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,739
What date? It's a guy.

1935
01:47:52,909 --> 01:47:55,503
So you know... He called me.

1936
01:47:55,749 --> 01:47:57,546
- Already?
- Keith called you?

1937
01:47:59,829 --> 01:48:01,706
This guy really gets around.

1938
01:48:04,829 --> 01:48:08,742
- Do you mind?
- No, I don't mind. Why should I mind?

1939
01:48:09,229 --> 01:48:10,742
What did he say?

1940
01:48:10,909 --> 01:48:12,740
He asked me out for Saturday night.

1941
01:48:13,229 --> 01:48:14,503
- You going?
- No.

1942
01:48:14,669 --> 01:48:16,819
- I told him I was busy.
- Oh, really?

1943
01:48:16,989 --> 01:48:18,900
So we're going out Friday.

1944
01:48:24,989 --> 01:48:27,059
- Friday?
- Yeah.

1945
01:48:27,629 --> 01:48:29,142
He's going out with you on Friday?

1946
01:48:29,869 --> 01:48:33,066
- Yeah?
- He's supposed to see me on Friday.

1947
01:48:34,989 --> 01:48:37,378
- I didn't know.
- We made plans!

1948
01:48:38,069 --> 01:48:40,629
- Well... I'll cancel it.
- No, don't cancel it.

1949
01:48:41,829 --> 01:48:44,741
Well, this is a little
awkward, isn't it?

1950
01:48:44,909 --> 01:48:46,740
Well, frankly, it is.

1951
01:48:48,149 --> 01:48:50,424
I've never seen you jealous before.

1952
01:48:50,589 --> 01:48:52,580
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.

1953
01:48:52,749 --> 01:48:53,943
You didn't even watch it.

1954
01:48:54,109 --> 01:48:55,861
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

1955
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:58,589
Are you jealous of him
or are you jealous of me?

1956
01:49:05,869 --> 01:49:08,258
Any Hennigan's around here?

1957
01:49:14,349 --> 01:49:15,862
Vandalay Industries.

1958
01:49:18,349 --> 01:49:20,658
Kell Varnsen speaking.

1959
01:49:21,629 --> 01:49:23,221
May we help you?

1960
01:49:23,789 --> 01:49:25,939
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.

1961
01:49:27,269 --> 01:49:28,907
No, no, I don't mind at all.

1962
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:32,300
- No, no, no. I can cancel.
- Sure. We'll do something next week.

1963
01:49:32,469 --> 01:49:34,221
No, it's no problem at all.

1964
01:49:34,389 --> 01:49:36,778
Okay. Take it easy.

1965
01:49:37,349 --> 01:49:39,909
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.

1966
01:49:40,349 --> 01:49:42,067
Hey, what are you doing
Friday night?

1967
01:49:42,229 --> 01:49:44,584
Friday night? Nothing. Now.

1968
01:49:45,389 --> 01:49:46,708
Want to come to see the baby?

1969
01:49:47,229 --> 01:49:50,904
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.

1970
01:49:51,549 --> 01:49:53,983
If you don't see the baby now,
you're never gonna see her.

1971
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:56,947
- All right, I'll go.
- All right. All right.

1972
01:50:08,589 --> 01:50:09,863
I'll get it.

1973
01:50:11,309 --> 01:50:12,867
Hello.

1974
01:50:13,509 --> 01:50:14,908
What-delay Industries?

1975
01:50:15,069 --> 01:50:16,388
- No!
- Vandalay!

1976
01:50:16,549 --> 01:50:17,777
Say Vandalay!

1977
01:50:17,949 --> 01:50:20,099
No, you're way, way, way off!

1978
01:50:20,269 --> 01:50:22,829
Yeah, that's the right number,
but this is an apartment.

1979
01:50:22,989 --> 01:50:25,139
- No, say...
- Vandalay! Say...

1980
01:50:25,749 --> 01:50:27,228
Vandalay Industries!

1981
01:50:28,069 --> 01:50:30,139
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

1982
01:50:35,669 --> 01:50:38,024
How did you know who they wanted?!

1983
01:50:45,509 --> 01:50:48,501
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

1984
01:50:55,549 --> 01:50:56,823
Just sign here, please.

1985
01:50:56,989 --> 01:50:59,742
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.

1986
01:50:59,909 --> 01:51:02,548
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?

1987
01:51:02,709 --> 01:51:06,099
- I could sell latex like that.
- Just sign that.

1988
01:51:14,509 --> 01:51:17,103
- Who is this?
- It's my daughter.

1989
01:51:18,189 --> 01:51:20,464
This is your daughter?

1990
01:51:21,229 --> 01:51:23,060
My God!

1991
01:51:23,229 --> 01:51:25,299
My God!

1992
01:51:25,469 --> 01:51:28,825
I hope you don't mind my saying,
she is breathtaking.

1993
01:51:30,629 --> 01:51:32,460
You think so?

1994
01:51:33,629 --> 01:51:36,189
Would you take this picture away
from me? Just take it away.

1995
01:51:36,349 --> 01:51:38,579
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.

1996
01:51:38,749 --> 01:51:40,819
Let me just sign this and go.

1997
01:51:40,989 --> 01:51:42,183
You know...

1998
01:51:42,349 --> 01:51:44,419
...she doesn't even have a boyfriend.

1999
01:51:45,309 --> 01:51:47,220
Okay. Okay.

2000
01:51:47,669 --> 01:51:49,785
Who do you think you're talking to?

2001
01:51:49,949 --> 01:51:52,258
You trying to make a joke,
Mrs. Sokol? It's not funny.

2002
01:51:52,429 --> 01:51:53,623
I can tell you that.

2003
01:51:54,109 --> 01:51:55,462
I'm serious. She doesn't.

2004
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:58,982
You know, it's one thing to not
give me the extension.

2005
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:02,221
But to tease and
to torture me like this...

2006
01:52:02,389 --> 01:52:03,788
...there's no call for that.

2007
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:06,227
Would you like her phone number?

2008
01:52:09,909 --> 01:52:13,060
Mrs. Sokol,
I don't know what to say.

2009
01:52:13,229 --> 01:52:17,939
- Where should I sign this thing?
- No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it.

2010
01:52:19,509 --> 01:52:20,988
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.

2011
01:52:21,149 --> 01:52:24,107
Even if you get a job after
you've been unemployed...

2012
01:52:24,269 --> 01:52:27,500
...they take unemployment out
of your check every week...

2013
01:52:27,669 --> 01:52:30,502
...and show it to you in that little box.

2014
01:52:31,349 --> 01:52:34,785
How good can it be for your
confidence that every paycheck...

2015
01:52:34,949 --> 01:52:37,941
...has the word "unemployment"
on it?

2016
01:52:38,629 --> 01:52:40,984
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!

2017
01:52:41,149 --> 01:52:43,379
They're already getting ready
for you to be laid off.

2018
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,380
I have a friend who's unemployed.

2019
01:52:45,549 --> 01:52:47,267
He's collecting unemployment
insurance.

2020
01:52:47,429 --> 01:52:52,947
This guy has never worked this hard
in his life to keep this thing going.

2021
01:52:53,469 --> 01:52:58,259
He's down there every week waiting
on the lines and getting interviewed...

2022
01:52:58,429 --> 01:53:01,307
...and making up all these lies
about looking for jobs.

2023
01:53:01,469 --> 01:53:06,748
If they had any idea the effort
and energy that he is expending...

2024
01:53:06,909 --> 01:53:10,026
...to avoid work, I'm sure they'd give
him a raise. I'm sure of it.

2025
01:53:10,389 --> 01:53:12,983
The guy is doing a tremendous job...

2026
01:53:13,149 --> 01:53:14,502
...not working.

2027
01:53:17,069 --> 01:53:19,344
So tell me more
about this game six.

2028
01:53:19,509 --> 01:53:22,307
Well, there was two outs,
bottom of the tenth.

2029
01:53:22,469 --> 01:53:25,108
We're one out away
from losing the series.

2030
01:53:32,549 --> 01:53:34,619
Hello. How are you?

2031
01:53:36,269 --> 01:53:38,703
So, what do you think?

2032
01:53:39,389 --> 01:53:40,981
Do you love her?

2033
01:53:41,149 --> 01:53:43,504
Yes, I do love her.

2034
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:46,907
You have a very nice place here.

2035
01:53:47,069 --> 01:53:48,980
So who do you think she looks like?

2036
01:53:49,149 --> 01:53:50,582
Lyndon Johnson.

2037
01:53:51,589 --> 01:53:54,023
What? Lyndon Johnson?

2038
01:53:54,189 --> 01:53:55,338
He's joking.

2039
01:53:55,509 --> 01:53:58,819
No, I'm not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.

2040
01:53:58,989 --> 01:54:02,299
Jerry, I can't believe it took you
so long to see the baby.

2041
01:54:02,469 --> 01:54:05,700
I kept saying to Michael, "When is
Jerry going to see the baby?"

2042
01:54:05,949 --> 01:54:07,382
I was saying the same thing.

2043
01:54:08,029 --> 01:54:09,906
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.

2044
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:13,340
- You don't have to take a picture.
- I don't know where it is.

2045
01:54:13,509 --> 01:54:16,307
It's in the bottom drawer
of our dresser.

2046
01:54:16,469 --> 01:54:18,061
Hurry up!

2047
01:54:19,229 --> 01:54:20,901
He's such an idiot.

2048
01:54:22,669 --> 01:54:25,058
Jerry, you want to pick her up?

2049
01:54:25,229 --> 01:54:26,981
- I better not.
- I'll pick her up.

2050
01:54:27,149 --> 01:54:28,628
No!

2051
01:54:29,949 --> 01:54:32,668
Thank you for a wonderful time,
George.

2052
01:54:32,829 --> 01:54:34,023
Glad you enjoyed it.

2053
01:54:34,189 --> 01:54:37,306
I haven't had a Big Mac
in a long time.

2054
01:54:37,469 --> 01:54:39,221
Billions and billions.

2055
01:54:40,549 --> 01:54:42,346
Would you like to come up?

2056
01:54:43,509 --> 01:54:45,306
Would I like to come up?

2057
01:54:45,469 --> 01:54:48,142
I would love to come up.

2058
01:54:48,309 --> 01:54:49,822
I'm... l'm fighting not to.

2059
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:51,547
Fighting.

2060
01:54:52,389 --> 01:54:54,266
Unfortunately, I...

2061
01:54:54,429 --> 01:54:58,741
...have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.

2062
01:54:58,909 --> 01:55:01,469
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

2063
01:55:02,589 --> 01:55:05,467
I got me an appointment
with a hardware store.

2064
01:55:05,629 --> 01:55:08,063
I'm not saying I want to do it
for the rest of my life...

2065
01:55:08,229 --> 01:55:10,106
...but hardware fascinates me.

2066
01:55:10,269 --> 01:55:12,578
Wouldn't you love to make a key?

2067
01:55:15,429 --> 01:55:17,499
Will you call me as soon
as you get home?

2068
01:55:19,589 --> 01:55:21,705
- Tonight?
- Yes.

2069
01:55:21,869 --> 01:55:26,260
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?

2070
01:55:27,829 --> 01:55:30,741
You kill me. You really kill me.

2071
01:55:32,429 --> 01:55:33,942
Well, good night.

2072
01:55:39,469 --> 01:55:42,267
It was an accident. Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.

2073
01:55:42,429 --> 01:55:44,818
Oh, she's gonna be all right.

2074
01:55:45,869 --> 01:55:48,337
Here, baby. Here.
Here, baby.

2075
01:55:48,509 --> 01:55:51,228
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?

2076
01:55:51,709 --> 01:55:53,222
I have a friend who's got a baby.

2077
01:55:54,269 --> 01:55:56,100
"Gotta see the baby.

2078
01:55:56,349 --> 01:56:00,183
You've got to come over
and see the baby."

2079
01:56:02,109 --> 01:56:05,385
Nobody ever wants you to come over
and see their grandfather, do they?

2080
01:56:05,549 --> 01:56:08,427
"You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.

2081
01:56:08,589 --> 01:56:10,420
He's so cute.

2082
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:16,027
168 pounds, 4 ounces.
I love them when they're this age.

2083
01:56:16,189 --> 01:56:17,542
He's 1000 months.

2084
01:56:17,709 --> 01:56:21,384
You know, the mid-80s is such
a good time for the grand-people.

2085
01:56:21,549 --> 01:56:23,221
The mid-80s, you gotta see them.

2086
01:56:23,389 --> 01:56:26,028
He went to the bathroom
by himself today."

2087
01:56:27,949 --> 01:56:30,941
You know what's tough about seeing
people when they have a baby...

2088
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:34,226
...is that you have to match
their level of enthusiasm.

2089
01:56:34,389 --> 01:56:36,459
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.

2090
01:56:36,629 --> 01:56:38,142
"What do you think of him?"

2091
01:56:38,309 --> 01:56:40,186
I'd like to meet a couple that goes:

2092
01:56:40,349 --> 01:56:43,546
"You know, we're not that happy
with him, frankly.

2093
01:56:43,709 --> 01:56:46,985
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.

2094
01:56:47,149 --> 01:56:49,788
You want him? We don't even
want him. You want him?"

2095
01:56:52,429 --> 01:56:55,387
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.

2096
01:56:55,549 --> 01:56:57,028
Yeah, it was.

2097
01:56:57,789 --> 01:57:00,781
Gosh, should I kiss her good night?

2098
01:57:01,509 --> 01:57:03,818
Is he going to try and kiss me?

2099
01:57:04,549 --> 01:57:07,347
- I love Cajun cooking.
- Really?

2100
01:57:07,509 --> 01:57:09,306
You know, my mom's
one-quarter Cajun.

2101
01:57:09,469 --> 01:57:12,267
Oh, my father's half-drunk.

2102
01:57:15,309 --> 01:57:17,300
Maybe they should get together.

2103
01:57:18,029 --> 01:57:19,508
Go ahead. Kiss her.

2104
01:57:19,669 --> 01:57:21,944
I'm a baseball player, damn it.

2105
01:57:23,069 --> 01:57:24,627
What's he waiting for?

2106
01:57:24,789 --> 01:57:26,666
I thought he was a cool guy.

2107
01:57:28,189 --> 01:57:31,943
Come on. I won the MVP in '79.
I can do whatever I want to.

2108
01:57:34,869 --> 01:57:37,144
Well, this is getting awkward.

2109
01:57:38,349 --> 01:57:40,817
Well, good night.

2110
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:42,217
Good night.

2111
01:57:47,709 --> 01:57:50,018
Who does this guy think he is?

2112
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:52,180
I'm Keith Hernandez.

2113
01:57:55,029 --> 01:57:56,178
Who else?

2114
01:57:56,869 --> 01:57:58,746
Mookie. Mookie was there.

2115
01:57:58,909 --> 01:58:00,501
You know him?

2116
01:58:01,309 --> 01:58:03,948
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.

2117
01:58:04,909 --> 01:58:07,104
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.

2118
01:58:07,269 --> 01:58:10,659
- He's the one who got that hit...
- I know. He got the hit in game six!

2119
01:58:12,589 --> 01:58:13,908
So then what happened?

2120
01:58:14,829 --> 01:58:16,103
Nothing. Then he took me home.

2121
01:58:18,149 --> 01:58:20,299
So did you two...

2122
01:58:22,749 --> 01:58:23,943
...have...?

2123
01:58:25,469 --> 01:58:27,141
What?

2124
01:58:28,509 --> 01:58:30,181
You know.

2125
01:58:30,829 --> 01:58:31,944
Milk?

2126
01:58:34,749 --> 01:58:37,707
- No.
- Cookies?

2127
01:58:39,309 --> 01:58:40,901
Did he kiss you good night?

2128
01:58:41,469 --> 01:58:42,822
I don't know.

2129
01:58:43,989 --> 01:58:45,741
What do you mean, you don't know?

2130
01:58:46,269 --> 01:58:49,341
All right. He kissed me, okay?

2131
01:58:49,509 --> 01:58:50,988
Well, what kind of a kiss?

2132
01:58:51,149 --> 01:58:55,142
Was it a peck? Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?

2133
01:58:56,029 --> 01:58:58,020
Between a peck and a make-out.

2134
01:58:59,389 --> 01:59:01,266
So you like him.

2135
01:59:01,749 --> 01:59:03,865
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.

2136
01:59:04,029 --> 01:59:05,382
Now you're jealous of him?

2137
01:59:05,549 --> 01:59:08,188
I'm jealous of everybody.

2138
01:59:13,469 --> 01:59:14,788
Hello.

2139
01:59:14,949 --> 01:59:16,905
Oh, hi. What's happening?

2140
01:59:18,029 --> 01:59:19,257
What?

2141
01:59:22,429 --> 01:59:23,623
Sure.

2142
01:59:25,309 --> 01:59:26,503
Yeah, okay.

2143
01:59:26,669 --> 01:59:29,308
Then... I'll see you then.

2144
01:59:29,469 --> 01:59:30,697
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

2145
01:59:30,869 --> 01:59:32,018
Bye.

2146
01:59:32,789 --> 01:59:34,984
- Who was that?
- That was Keith.

2147
01:59:36,029 --> 01:59:39,146
- What's going on?
- He wants me to help him move.

2148
01:59:40,149 --> 01:59:42,458
Help him move?

2149
01:59:42,629 --> 01:59:43,948
Move what?

2150
01:59:44,109 --> 01:59:46,623
You know, furniture.

2151
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:49,867
So, what did you say?

2152
01:59:50,029 --> 01:59:52,384
I said, yes, but I don't feel right
about it.

2153
01:59:52,549 --> 01:59:54,824
I mean, I hardly know the guy.

2154
01:59:54,989 --> 01:59:57,708
That's a big step
in a male relationship.

2155
01:59:57,869 --> 02:00:00,667
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.

2156
02:00:03,349 --> 02:00:05,863
And you feel you're not
really ready for...

2157
02:00:06,029 --> 02:00:07,701
Well, we went out one time.

2158
02:00:07,869 --> 02:00:10,588
Don't you think that's coming on
a little too strong?

2159
02:00:11,669 --> 02:00:13,307
Hey.

2160
02:00:15,229 --> 02:00:16,742
What's going on?

2161
02:00:17,389 --> 02:00:19,584
Keith Hernandez just asked me
to help him move.

2162
02:00:20,029 --> 02:00:21,303
What?

2163
02:00:22,189 --> 02:00:23,907
Well, you hardly know the guy.

2164
02:00:27,189 --> 02:00:28,827
What a nerve!

2165
02:00:28,989 --> 02:00:31,867
You see? Wasn't I right
about this guy? Didn't I tell you?

2166
02:00:32,309 --> 02:00:34,186
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?

2167
02:00:35,309 --> 02:00:38,381
- I said, yes.
- You said yes?!

2168
02:00:38,829 --> 02:00:41,548
Don't you have any pride
or self-respect?

2169
02:00:41,709 --> 02:00:44,906
I mean, how can you prostitute
yourself like this?

2170
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:47,139
Are you gonna start driving him
to the airport?

2171
02:00:47,549 --> 02:00:49,380
I'm not driving him to the airport.

2172
02:00:49,549 --> 02:00:51,267
Oh, boy. I don't know.

2173
02:00:51,789 --> 02:00:54,098
- Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
- What?

2174
02:00:54,269 --> 02:00:55,622
Don't mention it to anybody.

2175
02:00:55,789 --> 02:00:58,098
I wish you never mentioned it to me.

2176
02:01:09,069 --> 02:01:11,378
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.

2177
02:01:11,549 --> 02:01:13,619
And I will call you
as soon as I get home.

2178
02:01:13,789 --> 02:01:15,381
Don't bother.

2179
02:01:16,389 --> 02:01:17,583
Bother? What kind of bother?

2180
02:01:17,749 --> 02:01:20,104
I would prefer it if you didn't.

2181
02:01:20,629 --> 02:01:23,780
- Why? Is anything wrong?
- It's over, buddy. Done.

2182
02:01:23,949 --> 02:01:28,579
Finished. So long. Goodbye.
Adios. Sayonara.

2183
02:01:29,629 --> 02:01:31,506
- Why?
- I've been thinking about it.

2184
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:33,705
You got no job.
You got no prospects.

2185
02:01:33,869 --> 02:01:35,860
You're like Biff Loman.

2186
02:01:37,949 --> 02:01:39,826
I went to the hardware store
interview.

2187
02:01:39,989 --> 02:01:42,264
You think I'm going to spend my life
with somebody...

2188
02:01:42,429 --> 02:01:45,421
...because he can get me a deal
on a box of nails?

2189
02:01:46,389 --> 02:01:47,947
I thought we were a team.

2190
02:01:48,589 --> 02:01:51,057
If I ever need a drill bit, I'll call you.

2191
02:01:51,229 --> 02:01:52,901
Carrie, could you do me a favor?

2192
02:01:53,069 --> 02:01:55,378
Could you not mention this
to your mother?

2193
02:01:57,989 --> 02:02:00,184
You know, I hate to brag...

2194
02:02:01,069 --> 02:02:03,867
...but I did win 11 straight
Gold Gloves.

2195
02:02:04,029 --> 02:02:06,497
I wouldn't have brought it up,
but since you mentioned it.

2196
02:02:06,989 --> 02:02:08,661
I didn't mention it.

2197
02:02:09,429 --> 02:02:11,306
Well, I won them anyway.

2198
02:02:11,829 --> 02:02:13,945
Well, so what? I mean...

2199
02:02:14,109 --> 02:02:16,179
...you played first base.

2200
02:02:16,349 --> 02:02:18,704
I mean, they always put
the worst player at first base.

2201
02:02:18,869 --> 02:02:21,588
That's where they put me,
and I stunk.

2202
02:02:22,549 --> 02:02:26,622
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

2203
02:02:27,349 --> 02:02:30,739
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

2204
02:02:30,909 --> 02:02:33,423
...and I know you'll never be there.

2205
02:02:33,789 --> 02:02:35,700
The way I figure it,
I've already been there.

2206
02:02:35,869 --> 02:02:38,861
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

2207
02:02:40,549 --> 02:02:44,144
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

2208
02:02:44,309 --> 02:02:47,221
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

2209
02:02:50,949 --> 02:02:52,940
You know, I hate to say this...

2210
02:02:53,109 --> 02:02:55,748
...but I really think that
we're hitting it off.

2211
02:02:55,909 --> 02:02:58,742
- Get it? Get it?
- Clever.

2212
02:03:01,629 --> 02:03:03,938
- What are you doing?
- What's that?

2213
02:03:04,509 --> 02:03:06,500
- You smoke?
- Yeah.

2214
02:03:07,549 --> 02:03:09,380
I didn't know you smoked.

2215
02:03:10,669 --> 02:03:12,148
Is that a problem?

2216
02:03:17,469 --> 02:03:19,505
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.

2217
02:03:19,669 --> 02:03:21,466
- How do you know?
- Who wouldn't like him?

2218
02:03:21,629 --> 02:03:22,982
I like him, and I'm a guy.

2219
02:03:23,669 --> 02:03:26,024
I suppose he's an attractive man.

2220
02:03:26,189 --> 02:03:29,147
Forget that. He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1979.

2221
02:03:29,309 --> 02:03:32,938
I'm making wisecracks in some
nightclub. This guy was in game six.

2222
02:03:33,349 --> 02:03:35,146
They're a perfect match.
They go together.

2223
02:03:35,309 --> 02:03:37,948
Like one of these brother and sister
couples that look alike.

2224
02:03:38,109 --> 02:03:41,465
I hate those couples. I could never be
one of those couples.

2225
02:03:41,629 --> 02:03:44,348
There are no bald women around,
you know.

2226
02:03:46,869 --> 02:03:49,906
I know this sounds a little arrogant,
but I never thought she'd find...

2227
02:03:50,069 --> 02:03:52,537
...someone she liked better
than me. But, you know...

2228
02:03:52,709 --> 02:03:54,984
...I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.

2229
02:03:55,149 --> 02:03:56,821
You know what I'd like to do?

2230
02:03:57,309 --> 02:04:00,062
I'd really like to have sex
with a tall woman.

2231
02:04:00,229 --> 02:04:04,017
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5".

2232
02:04:04,869 --> 02:04:06,063
Really?

2233
02:04:06,229 --> 02:04:08,379
What was the tallest woman
you ever slept with?

2234
02:04:08,549 --> 02:04:10,062
I don't know, 6'3".

2235
02:04:10,229 --> 02:04:12,868
Wow! God!

2236
02:04:13,789 --> 02:04:16,349
See, this is all I think about:
sleeping with a giant.

2237
02:04:17,629 --> 02:04:19,381
It's my life's ambition.

2238
02:04:19,549 --> 02:04:23,064
So I guess it's fair to say you've set
different goals for yourself than...

2239
02:04:23,229 --> 02:04:25,948
...say, Thomas Edison, Magellan,
these type of people.

2240
02:04:26,109 --> 02:04:28,179
Magellan? You like Magellan?

2241
02:04:28,349 --> 02:04:31,705
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

2242
02:04:32,069 --> 02:04:34,583
- Who do you like?
- I like de Soto.

2243
02:04:35,269 --> 02:04:37,578
- De Soto? What did he do?
- Discovered the Mississippi.

2244
02:04:37,789 --> 02:04:40,178
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

2245
02:04:42,749 --> 02:04:45,058
All right. I gotta go down
to the unemployment office.

2246
02:04:45,229 --> 02:04:47,697
- You want to take a walk?
- No, I got some stuff to do.

2247
02:04:47,869 --> 02:04:50,747
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment
at 3. I'm helping him move.

2248
02:04:51,109 --> 02:04:52,508
What?

2249
02:04:53,389 --> 02:04:56,267
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!

2250
02:04:56,429 --> 02:04:59,580
- I know. Isn't that something?
- Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

2251
02:04:59,749 --> 02:05:03,378
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.

2252
02:05:04,149 --> 02:05:06,185
Soon he'll have you driving him
to the airport.

2253
02:05:06,349 --> 02:05:08,817
I'm not driving him to the airport!

2254
02:05:13,349 --> 02:05:15,704
I gave. I gave everything I could,
Mrs. Sokol.

2255
02:05:15,869 --> 02:05:18,588
- Nothing was good enough for her.
- Sign here, please.

2256
02:05:18,749 --> 02:05:21,388
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.

2257
02:05:21,549 --> 02:05:24,825
I'll tell you, she's very particular,
your daughter. Very particular.

2258
02:05:24,989 --> 02:05:27,059
Is she looking for some
big hotshot businessman?

2259
02:05:27,229 --> 02:05:29,663
Well, I've got my pride too.
I'm not gonna beg her.

2260
02:05:29,829 --> 02:05:32,502
All right. Just sign it.
People are waiting.

2261
02:05:39,269 --> 02:05:40,463
You like baseball?

2262
02:05:42,029 --> 02:05:43,701
That was autographed
by the '86 Mets.

2263
02:05:43,869 --> 02:05:45,780
I saw every inning that year.

2264
02:05:46,749 --> 02:05:50,822
It's funny, because I happen to be
very good friends with...

2265
02:05:50,989 --> 02:05:52,945
...Keith Hernandez.

2266
02:05:53,109 --> 02:05:55,669
You know Keith Hernandez.

2267
02:05:55,829 --> 02:05:57,182
Know him?

2268
02:05:57,989 --> 02:05:59,945
Would you... like to meet him?

2269
02:06:00,389 --> 02:06:02,505
Oh, come on. Come on.

2270
02:06:03,029 --> 02:06:05,862
I can produce Keith Hernandez,
right here...

2271
02:06:06,509 --> 02:06:07,783
...within the hour.

2272
02:06:08,029 --> 02:06:09,462
All right.

2273
02:06:09,989 --> 02:06:11,866
You got one hour.

2274
02:06:13,269 --> 02:06:15,339
All right, Mrs. S.

2275
02:06:16,109 --> 02:06:19,943
I and my good pal
Keith Hernandez...

2276
02:06:20,349 --> 02:06:21,987
...will be right back.

2277
02:06:35,589 --> 02:06:38,228
129 West 81 st Street, and hurry.

2278
02:06:41,029 --> 02:06:42,428
Or not.

2279
02:06:47,829 --> 02:06:50,218
You better bring your gloves.
It's freezing out there.

2280
02:06:50,389 --> 02:06:54,268
It shouldn't take too long.
I'd say maybe, oh, four hours.

2281
02:06:55,909 --> 02:06:58,981
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.

2282
02:06:59,149 --> 02:07:01,140
We got two dressers and the bed.

2283
02:07:01,789 --> 02:07:04,587
- Is there a box spring?
- What's that?

2284
02:07:04,749 --> 02:07:06,740
- A box spring?
- Yeah, there's a box spring.

2285
02:07:06,909 --> 02:07:10,265
But it's attached to the headboard,
and we'll have to take that apart.

2286
02:07:10,429 --> 02:07:11,908
Then we got the couch.

2287
02:07:12,069 --> 02:07:15,141
- Is that a sectional?
- Yeah, 12 pieces.

2288
02:07:15,309 --> 02:07:18,904
- A marble coffee table.
- Is that a thick marble?

2289
02:07:19,549 --> 02:07:21,619
Three inches thick.
Got it in Italy.

2290
02:07:21,789 --> 02:07:25,338
But the big problem is gonna be
the convertible sofa.

2291
02:07:25,509 --> 02:07:27,181
When you move it,
it tends to open up...

2292
02:07:27,349 --> 02:07:29,783
...so it's going to be difficult
getting it downstairs.

2293
02:07:30,589 --> 02:07:32,261
Stairs?

2294
02:07:32,909 --> 02:07:36,822
- There's no elevator?
- No, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

2295
02:07:41,189 --> 02:07:43,180
- I'm sorry, I can't do this.
- What?

2296
02:07:43,349 --> 02:07:45,909
I can't do it! I can't!
It's too soon.

2297
02:07:46,069 --> 02:07:48,060
I don't know you.

2298
02:07:48,749 --> 02:07:52,458
I can't help you move, I'm sorry.
I can't! I just can't.

2299
02:08:01,309 --> 02:08:03,539
- Hello.
- Hello.

2300
02:08:05,069 --> 02:08:06,787
Oh, you don't remember me.

2301
02:08:08,989 --> 02:08:10,900
- No. Should I?
- Yeah, yeah, you should...

2302
02:08:11,069 --> 02:08:12,980
...because I certainly remember you.

2303
02:08:14,189 --> 02:08:15,941
Let me refresh your memory.

2304
02:08:16,349 --> 02:08:20,262
June 14th, 1987.

2305
02:08:20,429 --> 02:08:23,546
Mets-Phillies. You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.

2306
02:08:23,709 --> 02:08:25,859
Then you're coming up
the parking lot ramp.

2307
02:08:26,029 --> 02:08:28,418
You said, "Nice game, pretty boy."

2308
02:08:29,189 --> 02:08:32,420
- You remember.
- And then you spit on us.

2309
02:08:32,589 --> 02:08:34,386
- Hey, I didn't spit at you.
- Yeah, right.

2310
02:08:34,549 --> 02:08:37,302
- No, no. Then who was it?
- Look, the way I remember it...

2311
02:08:37,469 --> 02:08:40,381
...I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.

2312
02:08:40,549 --> 02:08:42,426
That's when you called me
"pretty boy."

2313
02:08:42,589 --> 02:08:45,308
Hey, that tick ed me off.
I was turning to say something...

2314
02:08:45,789 --> 02:08:47,381
...and as I turned around...

2315
02:08:47,669 --> 02:08:50,661
...I saw Roger McDowell
behind the bushes...

2316
02:08:50,869 --> 02:08:52,985
...over by that gravelly road.

2317
02:08:57,309 --> 02:09:00,426
Anyway, he was talking to someone,
and they were pointing at you.

2318
02:09:00,589 --> 02:09:02,545
I tried to scream out,
but it was too late.

2319
02:09:02,709 --> 02:09:04,188
It was already on its way.

2320
02:09:04,429 --> 02:09:05,544
I told you.

2321
02:09:07,709 --> 02:09:11,987
- It was McDowell.
- But why? Why McDowell?

2322
02:09:13,229 --> 02:09:15,697
Maybe because we were sitting
in the right-field stands...

2323
02:09:15,869 --> 02:09:18,144
...cursing at him in the bullpen
all game.

2324
02:09:18,749 --> 02:09:21,627
He must have caught a glimpse of us
when I poured that beer on his head.

2325
02:09:23,469 --> 02:09:26,108
- It was McDowell.
- Oh, boy.

2326
02:09:27,069 --> 02:09:30,425
- Look, Keith, we're sorry.
- Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.

2327
02:09:30,589 --> 02:09:32,625
Guys, don't worry about it.

2328
02:09:32,789 --> 02:09:35,701
- Well, I guess I better get going.
- What are you doing?

2329
02:09:35,869 --> 02:09:38,258
- I gotta move.
- You want any help?

2330
02:09:39,069 --> 02:09:41,139
- I'd love some. You sure?
- I'd love to help you.

2331
02:09:41,309 --> 02:09:42,537
Yeah, me too!

2332
02:09:42,709 --> 02:09:44,620
Okay, guys. We got to be careful
of one thing.

2333
02:09:44,789 --> 02:09:47,986
Some of the stuff is very fragile
We'll have to handle it like a baby.

2334
02:09:48,149 --> 02:09:49,867
Hey, no sweat.

2335
02:10:02,029 --> 02:10:03,223
Hello.

2336
02:10:03,389 --> 02:10:05,949
Oh, hi, Elaine. What's going on?

2337
02:10:06,109 --> 02:10:07,701
No, he just left.

2338
02:10:07,869 --> 02:10:09,348
You broke up with him?

2339
02:10:09,509 --> 02:10:11,067
Me too!

2340
02:10:12,869 --> 02:10:14,541
What happened?

2341
02:10:14,709 --> 02:10:18,827
Oh, smoking. You know, you're like
going out with C. Everett Koop.

2342
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:21,944
Me? No.
I couldn't go through with it.

2343
02:10:22,109 --> 02:10:24,145
I just didn't feel ready.

2344
02:10:24,309 --> 02:10:26,186
So, what are you doing now?

2345
02:10:26,629 --> 02:10:27,948
Oh, great idea. Okay.

2346
02:10:28,109 --> 02:10:29,827
I'll meet you there in, like,
30 minutes.

2347
02:10:29,989 --> 02:10:31,581
Okay, bye.

2348
02:10:32,349 --> 02:10:34,419
Keith! Keith!

2349
02:10:34,589 --> 02:10:37,945
- What happened? Where's Keith?
- You just missed him. He just left.

2350
02:10:38,989 --> 02:10:40,820
What do you need him for?

2351
02:10:41,389 --> 02:10:44,540
Keith! Keith! Up here!

2352
02:10:44,709 --> 02:10:46,267
Look, could you do me a favor?

2353
02:10:46,429 --> 02:10:48,659
I need you to go to the
unemployment office with me!

2354
02:10:49,349 --> 02:10:50,748
l... I'm Jerry's friend!

2355
02:10:50,909 --> 02:10:52,740
The guy from the locker room!

2356
02:10:52,909 --> 02:10:54,467
I'm the chucker!

2357
02:10:54,629 --> 02:10:56,620
lt'll take five minutes!

2358
02:10:56,789 --> 02:10:59,701
Wait! Wait!

2359
02:11:12,349 --> 02:11:13,702
Well, Biff...

2360
02:11:16,189 --> 02:11:17,542
...what's next?

2361
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:19,858
I don't know.

2362
02:11:22,029 --> 02:11:23,701
Excuse me.

2363
02:11:23,869 --> 02:11:25,461
I was walking behind you, and you...

2364
02:11:26,109 --> 02:11:27,781
...dropped your wallet.

2365
02:11:31,229 --> 02:11:34,301
When you're moving,
your whole world becomes boxes.

2366
02:11:34,469 --> 02:11:37,541
That's all you think about,
is boxes. Where are there boxes?

2367
02:11:37,709 --> 02:11:40,587
You just wander down the street,
going in and out of stores.

2368
02:11:40,749 --> 02:11:43,741
"Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?"

2369
02:11:43,909 --> 02:11:47,185
I mean, you can't even talk to people
because you can't concentrate.

2370
02:11:47,349 --> 02:11:50,341
"Shut up! I'm looking for boxes!"

2371
02:11:50,949 --> 02:11:53,986
So after a while, you become
really into it. You can smell them.

2372
02:11:54,149 --> 02:11:55,662
You walk into a store:

2373
02:11:55,829 --> 02:11:57,820
"There's boxes here.

2374
02:11:57,989 --> 02:12:01,777
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it! I can smell them!"

2375
02:12:02,869 --> 02:12:04,018
You become, like, obsessed.

2376
02:12:04,189 --> 02:12:07,226
"I love the smell of cardboard
in the morning."

2377
02:12:07,389 --> 02:12:10,506
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket:

2378
02:12:10,669 --> 02:12:12,341
"That's a nice box.

2379
02:12:13,069 --> 02:12:16,141
Does anybody know where
that guy got that box?

2380
02:12:16,309 --> 02:12:18,459
When he's done with it,
you think I could get that?

2381
02:12:18,629 --> 02:12:20,665
It's got some nice handles on it."

2382
02:12:20,989 --> 02:12:25,062
And that's what death is, really.
It's the last big move of your life.

2383
02:12:25,229 --> 02:12:26,662
The hearse is like the van.

2384
02:12:26,829 --> 02:12:28,342
The pallbearers are close friends.

2385
02:12:28,509 --> 02:12:31,706
The only ones you could really ask
to help you with a big move like that.

2386
02:12:31,869 --> 02:12:33,905
And the casket is that great,
perfect box...

2387
02:12:34,069 --> 02:12:35,866
...you've been looking for
your whole life.

2388
02:12:36,069 --> 02:12:38,742
The only problem is
once you find it, you're in it.

2389
02:13:23,989 --> 02:13:25,980
