1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,536
Hang on,
let me just pick up a paper.

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,635
Excuse me. Would you mind...

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,800
-...watching my bag for a minute?
-Yeah, no problem.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,912
-Let's go.
-Well, I gotta watch this guy's bag.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,149
-For how long?
-I'm sure he'll be back in a second.

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,955
-Nice stuff.
-Come on.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,955
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
watching my bag for a second?

8
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,062
Why? So I can stand here
like an idiot...

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,391
...not knowing
if you'll ever come back?

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,863
-Where are you going?
-I'm gonna be this guy's friend.

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,907
-New clothes?
-Yeah, I did some shopping.

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,411
Some new-clothes shopping.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,546
Can I borrow your menu?

14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,981
Strange, for new pants
there's noticeable wear...

15
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,053
...on the buttocks of those chinos.

16
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,388
Wait, those are the clothes
from the bag.

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,422
The guy never came back.

18
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,925
He asked you to watch them,
not wear them.

19
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,291
I'm still watching them.

20
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,525
-You look like a tourist.
-All right. Let me ask you something.

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,569
When do you start to worry
about ear hair?

22
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,770
When you hear, like, a soft rustling.

23
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,241
Puberty that never stops.

24
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,379
Ear puberty, nose puberty,
knuckle puberty.

25
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,538
You gotta be vigilant.

26
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,314
All right. Let me ask you this:

27
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,418
You know
where Walker Street is downtown?

28
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,020
-I got a league meeting there.
-Oh, right, the new job.

29
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,178
-Yeah.
-How is it?

30
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,655
I love it. New office, new salary.
I'm the new Wilhelm.

31
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,124
So who's the new you?

32
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,492
They got an intern
from Francis Lewis High.

33
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,125
His name is Keith.
He comes in Mondays after school.

34
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,968
-Hi, Alex.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

35
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,604
-Have you ordered yet?
-No.

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,239
I'll be right back.

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,839
Where are you meeting these women?
When they get off the bus...

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,945
-...at the Port Authority?
-Right here, George. In here.

39
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:59,980
Try opening this up. You'll find
the biggest dating scene in the world.

40
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,818
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

41
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,459
-Hey.
-Hey.

42
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,224
-Hi.
-Where's Jerry?

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,492
Well, he's in the shower.

44
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,193
-You want me to get him?
-No, no, no.

45
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,630
Actually,
I kind of need to speak to you.

46
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,867
Oh, well, let's sit down.

47
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,585
Kramer, remember that whole deal
with you selling Peterman...

48
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,918
...your stories for his book,
and then he gave them back to you?

49
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,555
Vaguely.

50
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,796
Well, I was kind of
short on material...

51
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,060
...and I put them
in the book anyway.

52
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,000
You put my life stories
in his autobiography?

53
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,970
Kramer, listen,
it is such a stupid book.

54
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,202
-lt doesn't matter.
-No, no. Sure it matters.

55
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,372
I've broken through, huh?

56
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,748
I'm part of popular culture now.
Listen, I'd like to thank Mr. Peterman.

57
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,583
He's doing a book signing
at Waldenbooks this afternoon.

58
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,625
Waldenbooks.
That's a major chain, huh?

59
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,624
Hey, Jerry,
I'm going to Waldenbooks.

60
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,392
Oh, get out! Get out!
I don't wanna live like this!

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,665
All right, let's go.

62
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,866
-Mr. Lippman, how are you?
-How are you?

63
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,742
-Well, I'm not bad. Not bad.
-What are you doing here?

64
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,907
I work for Pendant Publishing.
This is our book.

65
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,146
If you can call it that.

66
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:45,918
Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star
has his own book out now?

67
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,826
Hey, buddy. Remember me?

68
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,092
You're that gangly fellow
we bought the stories from.

69
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,726
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part.
What's your name, darling?

70
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,668
-Who are you?
-Oh, I'm--

71
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,671
Let me use your pen, will you?

72
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,899
--I'm the real Peterman.

73
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,105
All right, playtime's over.

74
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,347
Relax, man.

75
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,610
There's enough juice here
to keep us all fat and giggly.

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,488
I can't believe somebody
pulled the top off this muffin.

77
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,124
That was me. I'm sorry, l--

78
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,090
I don't like the stumps.

79
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,156
-So you just eat the tops?
-Oh, yeah, it's the best part.

80
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,664
It's crunchy. It's explosive. It's--

81
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,599
It's where the muffin
breaks free of the pan...

82
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,467
...and sort of does its own thing.

83
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,211
I'll tell you, that's a million-dollar idea
right there. Just sell the tops.

84
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,508
Okay. Let's go, slim. That's enough.

85
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,344
-I have a right to be here.
-Come on.

86
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,715
These are my fans.
Hey, you're hurting my elbow.

87
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,523
Try looking up, hayseed.

88
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,827
You wanna sightsee, get on a bus.

89
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,424
Please don't think
all New Yorkers are so rude.

90
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,899
-Well, no, actually I'm--
-I'm Mary Anne.

91
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,970
I work for the New York
Visitors Center.

92
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,004
Where are you visiting from?

93
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,606
Little Rock, Arkansas.

94
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,545
That looks new.

95
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,197
So get this:
Peterman has his henchmen...

96
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,995
...forcefully eject me
from the book signing.

97
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,695
Like I'm some sort of maniac.

98
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,940
-Yeah, that's too bad.
-What's the matter with you?

99
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,941
-Nothing.
-No, no, no, don't give me that.

100
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,808
I know you. Something's wrong.
What is it? What happened?

101
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,917
-I did something stupid.
-What did you do?

102
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,917
-Well, I was shaving...
-Yeah.

103
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,023
...and I noticed an asymmetry
in my chest hair.

104
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,919
And I was trying to even it out.
And the next thing I knew:

105
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,426
Gone.

106
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,193
Don't you know you're not supposed
to poke around down there?

107
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,961
-Well, women do it.
-"Well, women do it."

108
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,264
Well, I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up
a sundress and a parasol...

109
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,966
...and you can just sashay your pretty
little self around the town square.

110
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,735
-Well, what am I gonna tell Alex?
-Now, you listen to me.

111
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,972
You don't tell anybody about this.
No one. You hear me?

112
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,472
-Hey.
-Hey.

113
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,811
-Jerry shaved his chest.
-Hey!

114
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,882
I forgot. Wait, never mind.

115
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,460
You couldn't pay me enough
to ride a horse in this city.

116
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,688
I mean, it's hard enough to cross
the street in a pair of sneakers...

117
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,631
...Iet alone six feet in the air
on a jittery, glassy-eyed dinosaur.

118
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,134
How about the beach this weekend?

119
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,906
Well, you couldn't pay me enough
to go to the beach on a weekend.

120
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,635
-I mean, it's hard enough to park--
-All right, all right.

121
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,540
Is that a Mexican Hairless?
I love those.

122
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:01,483
Oh, hairless. This is where it's at.
It's so much smoother and cleaner.

123
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,612
Really?

124
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,816
Excuse me.
Are you eating a muffin top?

125
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,485
Yeah, a muffin-top store
just opened up down the street.

126
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,797
-A muffin-top store?
-What did I just say?

127
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,613
Top of the muffin to you.

128
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,948
Elaine.

129
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,814
Mr. Lippman?

130
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,648
So you're pretending to be a tourist?

131
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,955
It's beautiful.

132
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,155
She makes all the plans.

133
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,729
I'm not from around here,
so it's okay if I'm stupid.

134
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,764
And she knows
I'm only in town visiting...

135
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,994
...so there's no messy breakups.

136
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,697
-How do you explain your apartment?
-I got a hotel room.

137
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,005
You moved into a hotel?

138
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,805
Well, I don't know anyone here, Jerry.
Where else am I gonna stay?

139
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,984
So get this: We're in the park today.
Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.

140
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,818
-So?
-So I figured...

141
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,684
...since she likes one hairless animal,
why not another?

142
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,886
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

143
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,925
-You tell her you shaved it?
-Are you nuts?

144
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,030
I don't want her to think
I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys...

145
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,098
...who shaves his chest.

146
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,226
Hey, Jerry!

147
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,170
I'm starting a Peterman
Reality Bus Tour. Check it out.

148
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,143
Reality tour?

149
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,775
The last thing this guy is qualified
to give a tour of is reality.

150
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,185
This was my idea.
You stole my idea.

151
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,520
Elaine, these ideas are all in the air.
They're in the air.

152
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,218
Oh, well, then, if that air
is coming out of this face...

153
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,387
...then it is my air and my idea.

154
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,295
-You want a muffin or not?
-Peach.

155
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,701
So I've noticed you don't have
much of an accent.

156
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,573
Yeah, my parents have it.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

157
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,415
So I was thinking maybe tonight
we could go back to my hotel.

158
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,517
I got SpectraVision.

159
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,251
First five minutes free.

160
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,218
Look, George...

161
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,189
...I'm really enjoying
spending time with you...

162
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,090
...but I'm not sure
this is gonna work out.

163
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,255
At some point you're going back
to your job at Tyler Chicken...

164
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,424
...and your three-legged dog, Willy.

165
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,064
And I'm still gonna be here.

166
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,177
Well, what if I told you
I'm thinking of moving here?

167
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:45,774
George, no offense,
but this city would eat you alive.

168
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,025
You're moving to New York?
That's fantastic.

169
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,129
I can see you all the time now.

170
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,963
Eat me alive, huh?
We'll see who can make it in this town.

171
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:10,302
-What is it she thinks you can't do?
-Find a job, get an apartment.

172
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,205
How did you do those things?

173
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,807
Never mind, they're done.
All I have to do now is redo them.

174
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,146
You know, if you take everything
I've accomplished in my entire life...

175
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,550
...and condense it down into one day,
it looks decent.

176
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,118
Hey, what were you doing
with that bus yesterday?

177
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,958
Here you go. Here you go.
Check it out.

178
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,528
"The Real Peterman
Reality Bus Tour."

179
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,170
-I'm confused.
-That Peterman book is big business.

180
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,499
People wanna know
the stories behind the stories.

181
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,801
Nobody wants to go
on a three-hour bus tour...

182
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,308
...of a totally unknown person's life.

183
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:51,178
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get
a pizza bagel and dessert.

184
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,615
-What's dessert?
-Bite-size 3 Musketeers.

185
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,850
Just like the real Peterman eats.

186
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,117
-He eats those?
-No, I eat those.

187
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,257
I'm the real Peterman.

188
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,992
-I don't--
-Wait a minute.

189
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,456
I think I understand this.

190
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,601
J. Peterman is real.
His biography is not.

191
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,703
Now, you, Kramer, are real.

192
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,863
-Talk to me.
-But your life is Peterman's.

193
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,509
Now, the bus tour, which is real...

194
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,941
...takes you to places that,
while they are real...

195
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,138
...they are not real in the sense
that they did not really happen...

196
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,340
...to the real Peterman, which is you.

197
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,244
-Understand?
-Yeah, it's 37.50 for a 3 Musketeers.

198
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,896
Elaine, I'm in over my head.
Nobody likes my muffin tops.

199
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,056
So? What do you want
me to do about it?

200
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,066
You're the muffin-top expert.
Tell me what I'm doing wrong.

201
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,535
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you
at Pendant Publishing...

202
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,165
...I believed in you, you know,
as a man of integrity.

203
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:56,303
But when I saw you
in that paper hat and that apron--

204
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,814
What if I cut you in
for 30 percent of the profits?

205
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,179
Deal. Here's your problem:

206
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,119
You're making just the muffin tops.

207
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,057
-What do you mean?
-You gotta make the whole muffin.

208
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,924
Then you...

209
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,730
...pop the top, toss the stump.

210
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,935
Taste.

211
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,469
-So, what do we do with the bottoms?
-Give them to a soup kitchen.

212
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,841
-It's a good idea.
-And one more thing.

213
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,245
Do you really think
we need the exclamation point?

214
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,821
Because it's not,
"Top of the muffin to you!"

215
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,513
No, no, it is.

216
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,286
Hey, Jerry.

217
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,362
What's this?

218
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,364
Lady Gillette?

219
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,094
Oh, what's going on?

220
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,895
-Hey.
-What?

221
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,563
-Jeez.
-Can't I get a moment's peace?

222
00:12:55,741 --> 00:13:00,007
-What are you doing to yourself?
-I can't stop.

223
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,749
-Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
-What? You can't keep this up.

224
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,475
Don't you know
what's gonna happen?

225
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,486
Every time you shave it, it's gonna
come in thicker and fuller and darker.

226
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:15,025
-Oh, that's an old wives' tale.
-ls it? Look at this.

227
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:20,662
-What is--? What is that?
-Look at it! Look at it!

228
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,831
It's all me.
I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.

229
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,239
Oh, come on. That's genetic.
That's not gonna happen to me.

230
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,505
Won't it?
Or has it already started to happen?

231
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,511
Look at this, we're cleaning up.

232
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,744
Oh, Reuben, get me another tray
of low-fat cranberry, please.

233
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,785
Excuse me. I'm Rebecca DeMornay,
from the homeless shelter.

234
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,587
-Oh, hi.
-Are you the ones...

235
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,992
...Ieaving those muffin pieces
behind our shelter?

236
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,928
-You've been enjoying them?
-They're just stumps.

237
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,899
-Well, they're perfectly edible.
-Oh, so you just assume...

238
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,369
...the homeless will eat them?
They'll eat anything?

239
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,667
-No, we just thought--
-I know what you thought:

240
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,674
"They don't have homes.
Don't have jobs.

241
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,246
What do they need the top of a muffin
for? They're lucky to get the stumps."

242
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,907
If the homeless don't like them,
the homeless don't have to eat them.

243
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,986
The homeless don't like them.
We've never had so many complaints.

244
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,419
Every two minutes:
"Where's the top of this muffin?

245
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,889
-Who ate the rest?"
-We were just trying to help.

246
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,585
Why don't you drop off
chicken skins and lobster shells?

247
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,457
I think I might.

248
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,928
I can't believe
you found something so quickly.

249
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,432
-How much are you paying?
-Twenty-three hundred.

250
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,401
-Ouch, a month?
-Yeah.

251
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,035
Well, I guess that's all right for now.

252
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,644
But if you stay here more than
a few months, you're a real sucker.

253
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,640
Yeah, well, l.... I got lots
of other stuff to show you too.

254
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,217
Wait till you see
the plum job that I landed.

255
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,419
Yeah, we should let this place
air out anyway.

256
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,786
It smells like the last tenant
had monkeys or something.

257
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,857
Coming up on the right...

258
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,695
...if you glance up, you'll just make out
my bedroom window.

259
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,803
It's the one
that's covered in chicken wire.

260
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,462
Hey, if you're the real Peterman...

261
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,109
...how come you're wearing
those ratty clothes?

262
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,379
-What?
-Well, they're not very romantic.

263
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,775
Well, that's your opinion.

264
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,112
Can I have another 3 Musketeers?
They're rather small.

265
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,617
Forget it.

266
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,153
Okay, Newman's postal route
is around here somewhere.

267
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,018
-Who's Newman?
-Who cares?

268
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,217
Hey, fake Peterman, let me off.
I'm nauseous.

269
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,623
Can I have his candy bar?

270
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,121
Everyone just settle down.

271
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,423
Okay, we got three hours left
on this thing...

272
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,162
...and I can't drive and argue
with you rubes all at the same time.

273
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,635
Okay, Lomez's place of worship
is right on the right here.

274
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,703
-Why do I have to go on the tour?
-Jerry, you're a minor celebrity.

275
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,715
You know, if you go on this thing,
it could create a minor stir.

276
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,012
You can bring that little girlfriend
of yours...

277
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,984
...and I'll only charge you 60 bucks.

278
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,987
-Hey.
-Hey.

279
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,150
-How's business?
-Oh, I got stump trouble.

280
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,626
The sanitation department
won't get rid of them all.

281
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,493
I can't get a truck to haul this stuff
until next week.

282
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,226
Meanwhile, I'm sitting
on a mountain of stumps.

283
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,233
All right.

284
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,397
I gotta hose the puke
off the floor of the bus.

285
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,476
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Bus? You got a bus?

286
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,977
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You got any room on that thing?

287
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,081
Yeah, there are a few seats
still available.

288
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,979
Do you think you could
transport some stumps for me?

289
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,052
I'll make it worth your while.

290
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,985
Well, if they don't mind
sitting in the back.

291
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,685
No, they don't.

292
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,852
Are they war veterans?

293
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,898
This is your office?

294
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,094
Oh, hello. Sorry, George...

295
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,468
...didn't know you had a girl in here.
Leave a signal on the doorknob...

296
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,439
...Iike a necktie or a sock or something.
Come on, help me out.

297
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,602
Mr. Steinbrenner,
I would like to thank you...

298
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,544
...for taking a chance
on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken...

299
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,379
-...Iike our boy George here.
-Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?

300
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,714
Yes, very nice for her
to have met you, sir.

301
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,117
Wait a minute, George.

302
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,316
Be right with you.
Look, Mr. Steinbrenner--

303
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,054
Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken.
Pretty impressive, George.

304
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,562
Days with the New York Yankees,
nights in Arkansas...

305
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,530
...with a topflight bird outfit.
And a hen supervisor, to boot.

306
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,229
I am blown. Blown away.

307
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:24,968
Blown, George. Blown!

308
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,041
You know,
when you make a pizza bagel...

309
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,081
...you really shouldn't
use cinnamon raisin.

310
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,277
You also shouldn't use a doughnut.

311
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,988
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour.

312
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,791
Turn music off.

313
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,332
-Kramer, can we just go?
-And go we will.

314
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,493
What is this? Pizza pound cake?

315
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,730
Well, we have a bonus
ultra-reality stop today.

316
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,809
We're gonna be hauling muffin stumps
to the local repository.

317
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,242
-We're going to a garbage dump?
-And we're off.

318
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,076
You know, I never thought he'd
be able to re-create the experience...

319
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,119
...of actually knowing him,
but this is pretty close.

320
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,293
Don Tyler? George Steinbrenner here.
I wanna talk about George Costanza.

321
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,125
I understand he's been
dividing his time between us and you.

322
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,665
-I cannot have that.
-Well, I don't know who he is...

323
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,531
...but if you want him that bad,
I'm not giving up that easy.

324
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,434
Oh, is that so? Playing a little
hardball, huh, Donny boy?

325
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,235
How about this:
You give me Costanza.

326
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,504
I convert your concessions
to all chicken, no charge.

327
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,013
Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs.
Instead of pretzels, chicken twists.

328
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,152
-lnstead of beer, alcoholic chicken.
-How do you make...

329
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,289
-...that alcoholic chicken?
-They ferment, just like anything else.

330
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,756
That stuff sounds great. All right,
I'll have Costanza on the next bus.

331
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,692
Hey, hey, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

332
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,200
-Well, I was gonna dump this.
-lt doesn't look like garbage.

333
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,498
-Well, it's muffin stumps.
-Where are the muffin tops?

334
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,799
This is a garbage dump.

335
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,239
-Just let me dump it.
-Can't do it.

336
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:11,007
-ls this a joke?
-That's what I like to know about it.

337
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,611
You have a pretty heavy beard,
don't you?

338
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,879
-What's that?
-Well, look.

339
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:22,687
-It's almost time for you to shave again.
-Oh, yeah.

340
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,758
Well, maybe I will take it up
with Consumer Affairs!

341
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,466
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
you're in for an additional treat.

342
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,335
We're going to extend the tour
at no extra charge.

343
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,567
-Where are we going?
-I don't know.

344
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,735
No more questions.

345
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:07,465
So the New York Yankees traded you
for a bunch of Tyler Chicken?

346
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:13,202
Dogs, twists,
and a fermented chicken drink.

347
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,040
Hey, aren't you the guy
I asked to watch my clothes?

348
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,715
-What clothes?
-These clothes.

349
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,044
The ones you're wearing.

350
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,189
-Kramer, how much longer?
-What?

351
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,055
My chest hair's growing back,
and it's itching me like crazy.

352
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,663
-I can't let her see me scratch it.
-Well, don't worry.

353
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:37,291
-I got a good feeling about this dump.
-I tell you, man, I'm losing it.

354
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,407
I can't sit on this bus anymore.

355
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,072
I think I'll go play with that dog.

356
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,150
I don't know where the tops are.

357
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,126
Jerry, what's the matter?

358
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,040
That feels good.

359
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,522
-Oh, hey, you looking for George?
-Yes.

360
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,253
He's been in the bathroom a while.
You might wanna check on him.

361
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,298
Jerry, you gotta bring me
some clothes here.

362
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,830
I lost my job with the Yankees.

363
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,833
I'm standing in a men's room
on 43rd Street in my underpants.

364
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,495
I told you
this city would eat you alive.

365
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,841
And I think my relationship's
in trouble.

366
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,740
-What is this guy again?
-They call him a cleaner.

367
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,546
He makes problems go away.

368
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,430
-Hello, Elaine.
-Where did you get the car?

369
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,268
It's a rental.

370
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,610
-Where are they?
-ln the back.

371
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,416
All right. I'm gonna need
a clean eight-ounce glass.

372
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,880
What is going on here?

373
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,714
If I'm curt, then I apologize.

374
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,413
But as I understand it,
we have a situation here.

375
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,889
And time is of the essence.
