1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,900
I'm on the street the other day,
make a pay phone call...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,300
...go overtime on the call...

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,800
...hang up the phone, walk away.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,600
You've had this happen?
What...?

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,400
Phone rings.
It's the phone company.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,400
They want more money.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,600
Don't you love this? And you've
got them right where you want them...

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,200
...for the first time in your life.
You're on the street.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
There's nothing they can do.
I like to let it ring a few times...

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,000
...you know, let her sweat
a little over there...

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,000
...and then just pick it up.
"Yeah, hello, operator?

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, I've got the money.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,900
I've got the money right here.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,700
You hear that?

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,200
That's a quarter.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,100
Yeah, you want that, don't you?"

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
No, they just have to get more cops
on the force, it's as simple as that.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,800
Cops, I don't even care about cops.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
I wanna see garbage men.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,600
It's much more important.
All I wanna see...

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,500
...are garbage trucks, garbage cans
and garbage men.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,400
You're never gonna stop crime.
We should at least be clean.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
I tell you what they should do.
They should combine the two jobs.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,000
Make it one job. Coplgarbage man.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,600
I always see cops walking around
with nothing to do. Grab a broom.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Start sweeping.
You sweep, sweep, sweep.

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,900
Catch a criminal,
get right back to sweeping.

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,600
- You should run for mayor.
- Nobody listens.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,200
Where is someone? I'm starving.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
Think this is him right here.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,300
- Is there a table ready?
- How many?

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
- How many?
- Is Tatiana coming?

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,100
Well, I don't know. I have to call her,
tell her where we are.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
I'm very lucky she's even
considering seeing me at all.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
Really? I thought things
were going okay.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,000
They were. It's kind of complicated.

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
Well, what is it?

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,800
- How many?
- All right, four. Seinfeld.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Four.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
That'll be five, 10 minutes.

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,000
- What do you wanna do?
- Let's go someplace else.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
- I am too hungry.
- We might as well just stay here.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
We haven't got much time
before the movie.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,100
I'm gonna call Tatiana.
There's the phone.

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,800
Tatiana.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
Excuse me. Are you gonna
be very long?

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Lasbrook, four.

48
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,000
- So did I do a terrible thing?
- You mean lying to your uncle?

49
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
I couldn't have dinner with him.

50
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,800
Plan 9 from Outer Space.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
One night only. The big screen.

52
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
My hands are tied.

53
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,100
You know, it's a public phone.
You're not supposed to just chitchat.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down
we'll be able to order right away.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,900
Can't look at a menu now,
I gotta be at the table.

56
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,600
He knows I'm waiting.

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
He sees me.
He just doesn't wanna look.

58
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Everything's gotta be just so
all the time with you, doesn't it?

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,000
I offered you those cookies
in my house.

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,300
Health cookies. I hate those
little dust-board fructose things.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
I just can't believe
the way people are.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,600
What is it with humanity?
What kind of a world do we live in?

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,700
What?

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,100
There's a woman over there
looks really familiar.

65
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,000
Dark hair, striped shirt.

66
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,300
I've never seen her before.

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,400
I know this woman.

68
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,200
This is gonna drive me crazy.

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,000
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Did you see that? Those people...

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,800
Look, they're getting a table.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Maybe they were here from before.

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,400
No, no, they weren't here before.

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,500
Are you gonna be much longer?

75
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,800
I have to make a very important call.

76
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,400
Find out what's going on.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,500
Excuse me.

78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,000
Didn't those people just come in?

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,500
- I believe we were ahead of them.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,700
- What's your name?
- Seinfeld.

81
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,500
No, no. They were here before.

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,400
Kackige, two.

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,100
You ever notice how happy people are
when they finally get a table?

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,800
They feel so special because
they've been chosen.

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
It's enough to make you sick.

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,100
Boy, you are really hungry.

87
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,200
Hey.

88
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,400
If anything happens here,
can I count on you?

89
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,500
What?

90
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,600
If we decide to go at it.

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,300
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble.

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,200
I have to get in touch with Tatiana.

93
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Look at his little outfit.

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,900
It's all so coordinated.
The little socks match the little shirt.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,900
I really hate this guy.

96
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Oh, I'm gonna faint.

97
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,100
George...

98
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,700
...who is that woman
In the stripes?

99
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,500
I don't know her.

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
She looks so familiar.

101
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,400
It's not fair that people are seated
first come, first served.

102
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
It should be based on
who's hungriest.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,300
I feel like walking over there
and taking some food...

104
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
...off of somebody's plate.

105
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,600
I'll tell you what.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
There's 50 bucks in it for you
if you do it.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,400
What do you mean?

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
You walk over to that table...

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
...you pick up an egg roll,
you don't say anything...

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,100
...you eat it...

111
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,700
...say, "Thank you very much"...

112
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,000
...wipe your mouth, walk away...

113
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
...I give you 50 bucks.

114
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,400
- What are they gonna do?
- They won't do anything. In fact...

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,600
...you'll be giving them a story
to tell for the rest of their lives.

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Fifty bucks?
You'll give me 50 bucks?

117
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,300
Fifty bucks.

118
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,200
That table over there.

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,700
The three couples.

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,300
Okay, I don't wanna go over there
and do it...

121
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,700
...and then come back here and find
out there was some little loophole...

122
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,500
...like I didn't put mustard on it
or something.

123
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,900
No tricks.

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,300
- Should I do it, George?
- For 50 bucks?

125
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,400
I'd put my face in their soup
and blow.

126
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,400
All right. All right.

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
Here, hold this.

128
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm doing it.

129
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,800
I know this sounds crazy,
but the two men standing behind me...

130
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,100
...will give me 50 bucks if I stand here
and eat one of your egg rolls.

131
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.

132
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
- What?
- What is she talking about?

133
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,300
What did she say?
What did she say?

134
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,400
- Will someone tell me what she said?
- Twenty-five dollars?

135
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,100
- What happened?
- Did you see that?

136
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,300
- What were you telling them?
- I offered them 25.

137
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,600
- They had no idea why.
- Oh, God.

138
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,200
- George, the phone's free.
- Hallelujah.

139
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,100
Excuse me. I was waiting here.

140
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,400
- Where? I didn't see you.
- I've been here for 10 minutes.

141
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,400
- I won't be long.
- That's not the point.

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
The point is I was here first.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,100
Well, if you were here first...

144
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,000
...you'd be holding the phone.

145
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,000
You know, we're living in a society!

146
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,800
We're supposed to act
in a civilized way!

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Does she care? No.

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,600
Does anyone ever display
the slightest sensitivity...

149
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,600
...over the problems
of a fellow individual?

150
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,200
No. No! A resounding no.

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,800
- Hey, sorry I took so long.
- Oh, that's okay.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,700
Really, don't worry about it.

153
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,000
How do people fast?

154
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,900
Did Gandhi get this crazy?

155
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm gonna go walk around
and see what dishes look good.

156
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,800
I told my uncle I had a stomachache.
Think he bought that?

157
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,500
Yeah, he probably bought it.

158
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
So, what happened with Tatiana?

159
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,000
- I shouldn't even tell you.
- Come on.

160
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,600
After dinner last week,
she invites me to her apartment.

161
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm with you.

162
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,800
Well, it's this little place
with this little bathroom.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,900
And it's, like, right there, you know?
It's not even...

164
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,500
...down a little hall or off in an alcove,
you understand?

165
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,200
There's no...

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
...buffer zone.

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,400
So...

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,700
...we start to fool around...

169
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,500
...and it's the first time,
and it's early in the going...

170
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,600
...and I begin to perceive
this impending...

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,700
...intestinal requirement...

172
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,300
...whose needs are going to surpass,
by great lengths...

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
...anything in the sexual realm.

174
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,700
So I know I'm gonna have to stop.

175
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,500
And as this is happening, I'm thinking
even if I can somehow manage...

176
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
...to momentarily...

177
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,500
...extricate myself
from the proceedings...

178
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,000
...and relieve this
unstoppable force...

179
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,600
...I know that that bathroom
is not gonna provide me...

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,300
...with the privacy that I know
I'm going to need.

181
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,200
This could only happen to you.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,300
So...

183
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,300
...I finally stop and say:

184
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,000
"Tatiana, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

185
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
...but I think it would be best
if I left."

186
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
You said this to her after?

187
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
No.

188
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
During.

189
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Wow. So?

191
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,800
So I'm dressing,
and she's staring up at me...

192
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,000
...struggling to compute this
unprecedented turn of events.

193
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,100
I don't know what to say
to reassure her.

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,500
And worst of all, I don't have
the time to say it.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,200
The only excuse she might
possibly have accepted...

196
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,600
...is if I told her I am,
in reality, Batman.

197
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
And I'm very sorry,
I just saw the Bat Signal.

198
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,900
It took me three days of phone calls
to get her to agree to see me again.

199
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,000
Now she's waiting for me to call,
and she's still on the phone.

200
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I hate this place.

201
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,900
I don't know why we came here.
I am never coming back here again.

202
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,300
Who is that woman?

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Remember when you first went
out to eat with your parents?

204
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,100
Remember?
It was such a treat to go.

205
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,900
And they serve you this different food
that you never saw before.

206
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,800
And they put it in front of you...

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,700
...and it was such a delicious
and exciting adventure.

208
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
And now I just feel
like a big sweaty hog...

209
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,300
...waiting for them
to fill up the trough.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Oh, she's off.

211
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,100
- Jerry, talk to that guy again.
- What am I gonna say?

212
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,200
Tell him we wanna catch a movie
and that we're late.

213
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,700
Hey. What stinks in here?

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Mr. Cohen, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

215
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,700
Well, I've been looking
for a better place.

216
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,000
Better place! Want a...?
Want a table?

217
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,100
No, just bring me a plate,
and I'll eat here.

218
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Bring him a plate.
He'll eat here.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Come on, I'll give you a table.

220
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,900
Excuse me.

221
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,000
We've been waiting here.

222
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,500
Now, I know we were ahead
of that guy. He just came in.

223
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,600
Oh, no.
Mr. Cohen always here.

224
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
He's always here? What does
that mean? What does that mean?

225
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,100
Mr. Cohen, very nice man.

226
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
He live on Park Avenue.

227
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Where am I?

228
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Is this a dream?

229
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
What in God's name
is going on here?

230
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,900
She's not there. She left.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,300
She must have waited and left,
because those people wouldn't get off.

232
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,300
- Did you leave a message?
- Yeah, I told her to call me here...

233
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,000
...and to tell anyone that answers...

234
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
...to ask for a balding,
stocky man with glasses.

235
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
I better tell them
I'm expecting a call.

236
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,000
- Jerry, here comes that woman.
- Where do I know her?

237
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,800
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey.

238
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,200
How are you doing?

239
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,200
- How is everything?
- Good, good.

240
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,600
What's going on?

241
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm working hard. And you?

242
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, you know, working around.

243
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,000
Same stuff.

244
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,700
Doing...

245
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,600
...whatever.

246
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,700
- You haven't been around in a while.
- I know. I know. Well...

247
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,700
...you know.

248
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,700
You should come by.

249
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,900
Definitely. I plan to.

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm not just saying that.

251
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,500
- Hi. I'm Elaine.
- Oh, Lorraine Catalano.

252
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I'm sorry. Lorraine, this is Elaine.

253
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,100
Well, it was nice seeing you, Jerry.
And nice meeting you.

254
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine.

255
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,600
Oh, my God, Lorraine.

256
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,900
That's Lorraine from
my uncle's office.

257
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
I am in big, big trouble.

258
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,700
- The one you broke the plans with?
- Yeah, she works in his office.

259
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,600
Now she's gonna see him
tomorrow...

260
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,900
...and tell him she saw me
here tonight.

261
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,700
He's gonna tell his wife.
His wife's gonna call my mother.

262
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,600
Oh, this is bad. You don't know.

263
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,500
The chain reaction of calls
this is gonna set off.

264
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,200
New York, Long Island, Florida.
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

265
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,700
Unfortunately,
nobody ever disappears.

266
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,100
My uncle to my aunt,
my aunt to my mother...

267
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
...my mother to my uncle.

268
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,400
My uncle to my cousin, my cousin
to my sister, my sister to me.

269
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
You should've just had dinner with him
tonight and gotten it over with.

270
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,200
- It's just a movie.
- Just a movie?

271
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
You don't understand.

272
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,700
This isn't Plans 1-8
from Outer Space.

273
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,100
This is Plan 9.

274
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,000
This is the one that worked.

275
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
The worst movie ever made.

276
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,500
I'm really looking forward to it.

277
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
I got news for you.
If we're making this movie...

278
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,300
...we gotta get a table
immediately.

279
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's stop fooling around.
Let's just slip him some money.

280
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,700
In a Chinese restaurant?
Do they take money?

281
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,700
"Do they take money?"
Everyone takes money.

282
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
I went out with a guy who did it all
the time. You slip them 20 bucks.

283
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,700
Twenty bucks?

284
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,800
Isn't that excessive?

285
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,500
Well, what do you wanna
give him, change?

286
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,800
It's more than the meal.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Oh, come on, we'll divide it up
three ways.

288
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,600
All right. Seven, seven, six.

289
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,500
I'm not gonna eat that much.

290
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm counting your shrimps.

291
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
Okay, who's gonna do it?

292
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
Oh, no, I can't do it.

293
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
I'm not good at these things.
I get flustered.

294
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,000
Once I tried to bribe an usher
at the Roller Derby.

295
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,900
I almost got arrested.

296
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,900
I guess it's you, Jer.

297
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,000
- Me? What about you?
- Oh, I can't do that. It's a guy thing.

298
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,200
The women's movement just can't
seem to make any progress...

299
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,600
...in the world of bribery, can they?

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Give me the money.

301
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
How's it going?

302
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Very busy.

303
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,300
Boy, we are really anxious
to sit down.

304
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,800
Very good specials tonight.

305
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,500
If there's anything you can do
to get us a table...

306
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
...we'd really appreciate it.

307
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,400
Oh, what is your name?

308
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,800
No, no, I wanna eat now.

309
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,500
Yes, whole sea bass dinner tonight,
very fresh.

310
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,900
Here. Take this. I'm starving.

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,200
Take it. Take it.

312
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Dennison, four!

313
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,400
Your table is ready.

314
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,400
No, no. I want that table.

315
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,800
I want that table!

316
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Come on, did you see that?
What was that?

317
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
He took the money.
He didn't give us a table.

318
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
- You lost the 20.
- Well, how could he do that?

319
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,900
- You didn't make it clear.
- Make it clear?

320
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,800
What a sorry exhibition that was.

321
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,300
All right, let me get the money back.

322
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
Excuse me.

323
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,800
I realize this is extremely
embarrassing.

324
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,400
My friend here apparently
made a mistake.

325
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,200
Your name?

326
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,400
- Seinfeld.
- Yes, Seinfeld, four.

327
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,400
No, no. Do you see the girl
over there with the long hair?

328
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh, yes, yes.

329
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,200
Very beautiful girl. Very beautiful.
Your girlfriend?

330
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

331
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,300
That's really not relevant here.

332
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,400
Relationships are difficult.

333
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,800
It is very hard to stay together...

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
All right, listen. All right.

335
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,400
How much longer is it gonna be?

336
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,700
Be about five, 10 minutes.

337
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,800
So?

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,800
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

339
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,000
- So when are we gonna eat?
- Five, 10 minutes.

340
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,400
We should've left earlier. I told you.

341
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't see any way we can eat
and make this movie.

342
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Oh, well, I have to eat.

343
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's order it to go,
We'll eat it in the cab.

344
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Eat it in the cab?
Chinese food in a cab?

345
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,300
- We'll eat it in the movie.
- Where do you think you're going?

346
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,300
You think they have
big picnic tables there?

347
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,600
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I say we leave now...

348
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,000
...we go to Sky Burger,
and we scarf them down.

349
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,300
I'm not going to Sky Burger.
Besides, it's in the opposite direction.

350
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,200
- Let's just eat popcorn or something.
- Cartwright?

351
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,300
I can't have popcorn for dinner.

352
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,900
- Cartwright!
- I have to eat.

353
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,900
Well, they have hot dogs there.

354
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,200
Oh, movie hot dogs?
I'd rather lick the food off the floor.

355
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,300
I can't go anyway. I have to wait here
for Tatiana's call.

356
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,000
Let me just check. Excuse me,
I'm expecting a call. Costanza?

357
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,600
Yes. I just got a call.

358
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,800
I yell, "Cartwright? Cartwright!"
Just like that.

359
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Nobody came up. I hang up.

360
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,400
Well, was it for Costanza or...?

361
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,400
Yes, yes, that's it.
Nobody answered.

362
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Was it a woman?

363
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,800
Yes, yes.

364
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
I tell her you not here.

365
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,500
She said curse word. I hang up.

366
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
She called.

367
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,600
He yelled, "Cartwright."

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
I missed her.

369
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,800
Who's Cartwright?

370
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm Cartwright.

371
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,600
- You're not Cartwright.
- Of course I'm not Cartwright!

372
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,300
Why don't you two go to the movies
by yourselves. I'm not in the mood.

373
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,600
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

374
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,700
- So you're not going?
- You don't need us.

375
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,400
Well, I can't go to a bad movie
by myself.

376
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,700
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks to strangers?

377
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,600
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

378
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,100
- Should we tell him we're leaving?
- What for? Let's just get out of here.

379
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,000
Seinfeld, four!

380
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,700
Hunger will make people
do amazing things.

381
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,000
I mean, the proof of that
is cannibalism.

382
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
Cannibalism. What...?

383
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,800
What do they say? I mean,
they're eating, you know.

384
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,100
"This is good. Who is this?

385
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,600
I like this person."

386
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
You know, I mean...

387
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,200
I would think the hardest thing
about being a cannibal...

388
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,000
...is trying to get some really
deep sleep.

389
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,000
You know what I mean?
I would think you'd be like:

390
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,900
"What was that? Who's there?

391
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Who's there? Is somebody there?

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
What do you want?
What do you want?

393
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,400
You look hungry. Are you hungry?

394
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,900
Get out of here."

395
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
