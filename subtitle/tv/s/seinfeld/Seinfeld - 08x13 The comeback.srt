1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,274
-Well, that was all right, huh?
-Yeah.

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,875
Well...

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,012
-...good night.
-Yeah, good night.

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,110
Jerry, we can only stay four days.

5
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,221
Well, I'm upset,
but we'll make the most of it.

6
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,254
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?

7
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,724
Yes. Oh, your father bought
an exercise device off television.

8
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,294
He does it every morning at 4.

9
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,160
Only 25 minutes a day, and you can
attach it to any doorknob.

10
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,761
So I guess your travel miles
are about to expire?

11
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:14,634
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted
to talk to you about something.

12
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,402
Am I finally getting a baby brother?

13
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,142
Jerry, be serious.

14
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,473
How would you feel
if we sold the Cadillac?

15
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,843
What? The Cadillac
I bought for you?

16
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,382
It's too much car, Jerry.

17
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,919
Oh, come on. You love that car.
What about the Northstar system?

18
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,148
I don't think we even use it.

19
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,925
Well, it's a gift,
and I want you to keep it.

20
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,493
We already sold it.

21
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,156
Why didn't you tell me
before you sold it?

22
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,027
We had a buyer, and we couldn't
get a free flight until now.

23
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,828
We could but we wanted
the bulkhead.

24
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,629
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,302
Man, that Emily is wearing me out.

26
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,103
-Kramer....
-No, no, no, it's not the sex, Jerry.

27
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,505
Hey, Seinfelds.

28
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,340
-Hi, Kramer.
-Hi, Kramer.

29
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,039
-We're in the middle of a discussion.
-Yeah? What about?

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,185
Jerry's upset.
We sold the Cadillac.

31
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,116
-What did you get for it?
-Jack Klompus gave us 6 grand.

32
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,620
You sold my Cadillac
to Jack Klompus?

33
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,122
We want you to have the money.

34
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,419
-I don't need money.
-What are you talking about?

35
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,187
You had a check bounce
at the bodega.

36
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,730
Is that what this is all about? I bounce
a check and you sold a Cadillac?

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,392
Well, also, Jerry, we read
an article in the Sun-Sentinel.

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,266
It says that standup comedy
is not what it used to be...

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,237
...what with Def Jam and all.

40
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,035
Yeah, that Def Jam is a force.

41
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,377
Jerry, you know,
I hear wonderful things...

42
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,845
...about Bloomingdale's
executive training program.

43
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,540
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,050
You've given this comedy thing
your best shot.

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,121
Yeah, you had some
good observations, but it's over.

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,155
Now, this Bloomingdale thing:

47
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,020
That could be the next wave.

48
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,035
Excuse me. A pound
of Arabian Mocha Java, please.

49
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,338
So you understand how my Peterman
stock options are gonna work?

50
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,235
I'm going to the bathroom.

51
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,876
It's just very interesting.

52
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,672
Yeah, when it's your money
it's fascinating.

53
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,781
Arabian Mocha Java.

54
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,573
Oh, I got it.

55
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,543
That Arabian is strong coffee.

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,282
It's PLO blend.

57
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,788
Oh, I got your coffee.

58
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,419
-Oh, here, let me--
-No, it's on me.

59
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,690
Oh, man. Okay, listen, guys,
I'm gonna be late. I'll see you, okay?

60
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,834
-Yeah.
-Bye.

61
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,769
-You see what just happened here?
-What?

62
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,069
She treated me
to the Arabian Mocha Java.

63
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,473
And you misinterpret this how?

64
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,073
She's sticking it to me that
she makes more money.

65
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,479
I'm sure she was just being nice
buying you the coffee.

66
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,879
Not nice. Sticking it to me.

67
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,577
-You're crazy.
-Sticking it to me.

68
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,745
-George.
-Sticking it!

69
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,285
So you're buying the car
back for your parents?

70
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,953
-I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
-Your parents will never let you do it.

71
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,658
They lie to me about selling the car,
I'll lie to them about buying it back.

72
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,100
They think they can dump
6 grand on me? Think again.

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,672
What kind of money
you think your parents have?

74
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,333
-Excuse me?
-Bet they have more money than mine.

75
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,176
-Come on. Your parents have money.
-You think?

76
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,612
-When do they ever spend money?
-Never.

77
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,410
-What are their expenses?
-Nothing.

78
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,485
-Where do they go on vacation?
-Nowhere.

79
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,753
-How much do you think they have?
-Few hundred grand?

80
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,986
You're saying I stand to inherit
$300,000? Is that what you're saying?

81
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,154
-You may not see it for 20 years.
-Twenty years? That long?

82
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,197
Your father eat
bacon and eggs every day?

83
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,097
Unfortunately, yes.

84
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,832
How's your family history?

85
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,503
-I have an aunt that died at 7.
-Really?

86
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,737
Aunt Baby.

87
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,671
-Elaine, you got a moment?
-Yeah, Kramer, come on in.

88
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,312
I need to speak to you
about some lady problems.

89
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,350
Okay.

90
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,851
You know, after I have sex with Emily,
I don't want her in the bed anymore.

91
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,790
Yeah, because she's
throwing off my whole sleep.

92
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,829
-She's got the jimmy legs.
-Jimmy legs?

93
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,463
Jimmy leg.

94
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,902
So.... Well, maybe I should
just be honest with her, huh?

95
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,404
Tell her after sex
you just want her out of there?

96
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,168
Well, I'd say it nicely.

97
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,239
I don't think so.

98
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,877
Well, you know,
I really like this girl.

99
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,017
I think if I could
work out this one thing--

100
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,448
Yeah, I gotta be
honest with you, Kramer.

101
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,056
You might be more than
just a couple of tweaks away...

102
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,521
...from a healthy relationship.

103
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,753
Well, you're not exactly
zeroing in yourself, lady.

104
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,586
All right, get out.

105
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,494
Get out!

106
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,903
So listen, I've gotta go down to
Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.

107
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,540
You just heard about this today?

108
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,438
They had a cancellation,
and they instantly called me.

109
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,942
-Who cancelled?
-Carrot Top.

110
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,512
I told you: My career is fine.

111
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,911
I've been thinking about the family.

112
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,853
Tell me about Aunt Baby.

113
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,057
She's deceased.

114
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,783
Yeah.

115
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,760
Why did she die so young?

116
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,359
She had problems.

117
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,625
Internal.

118
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,701
Is that common in our family?

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,101
Well, your Uncle Moe,
he died a young man.

120
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,264
Also internal problems.

121
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,342
It's that temper on your side.

122
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,971
They're yelling and yelling and then
one day, they're all gone.

123
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,413
What about your side?
Your cousin Henny.

124
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,883
She was sickly
from the moment I met her.

125
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,988
Don't you talk about Henny!

126
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,418
So I guess you two
are the lucky ones.

127
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,387
So far.

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,192
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today,
how old would she be?

129
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,298
She'd never make it.

130
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,874
So let me get this straight.
You enjoy the lovemaking--

131
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,109
-Well, do you?
-Oh, yeah. Like strawberry pie.

132
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,644
Okay. But you have a problem
sharing a bed with me.

133
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,785
I know it's not what the ladies like...

134
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,944
...but without some solid sack time,
I'm a zombie.

135
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,989
-I don't know.
-Oh, come on, man.

136
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,990
Meet me halfway.

137
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,228
-You're not easy, Kramer.
-I know.

138
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:21,296
So to what do I owe the pleasure
of this unannounced visit?

139
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,135
I wanna buy back the Cadillac.

140
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,368
You wanna buy it back? Why?

141
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,275
You got drugs hidden in the trunk?

142
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,849
-I'm kidding.
-All right. I'll give you 9000 for it.

143
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,817
Nine thousand for a Cadillac?
It's got no miles on it.

144
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,650
-You bought it for six.
-You're not me.

145
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,390
-How much do you want for it?
-The Kelley Blue Book value: $22,000.

146
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,896
Fourteen thousand.

147
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,661
Done. But I get
to drive it tomorrow...

148
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,805
...because Doris
wants to go to Naples.

149
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,599
You need a pen?

150
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,633
Still works.

151
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,909
Hey, where's Jerry?

152
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,016
He's performing at Bally's
in Atlantic City.

153
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,311
Oh, okay.

154
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,416
Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit.

155
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,888
He always hides it from me.

156
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,829
Yeah, Bally's?
Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.

157
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,328
You know that number?

158
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,490
I used to have a problem.

159
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,360
What do you mean,
he's not registered?

160
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,702
-Well, S-E-l-N-V--
-F. F-E-L-D.

161
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,968
F-E-L-D.

162
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,842
Well, I think you're wrong.

163
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,017
All right, you have a lucky day too.

164
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,415
-He's not there?
-No, they never heard of him.

165
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,624
This is so nice of you to take us
all out to dinner, George.

166
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,628
Well, as much as I enjoy
all the good-natured ribbing...

167
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,459
...nothing really
makes me happier...

168
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,068
...than spending money
on the people I care about.

169
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,771
-Where's Jerry?
-Oh, he'll be here.

170
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,533
By the way, Elaine, thank you...

171
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,802
...for laying out
for the Arabian Mocha Java.

172
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,004
George, you didn't have to do this.

173
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,242
I'm president of a big company.
I can afford to buy you coffee.

174
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,080
-President?
-Yeah.

175
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,949
-Hey, look, he's back. Hey.
-Hey.

176
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,115
I got your message so I came
straight from Atlantic City.

177
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,386
Kramer called Bally's.
You weren't registered.

178
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,323
Well, I can't stay
under my own name.

179
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,399
I was registered
under "Slappy White."

180
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,062
Mom. Dad.

181
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,936
Well, look who's here.
Hello, Seinfelds.

182
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,612
-What are you doing here?
-We're having an upscale dinner.

183
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,682
-What?
-Well, after talking to you...

184
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,648
...we realized we may not
have much time left.

185
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,651
So we're blowing it all.

186
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,890
Look, George, it's a Pierre Cardin.

187
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:03,661
-That was all right.
-Yeah.

188
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,873
Well, I'll see you.

189
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,080
-Hello.
-Jerry.

190
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,876
I had a little mishap with the car.

191
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,655
I'm down here in Alligator Alley.

192
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,059
-You better get down here.
-All right.

193
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,054
Who was that?

194
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,390
That was the Golden Nugget...

195
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,361
...also in Atlantic City.

196
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,967
They heard such good things
about my show at Bally's...

197
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,728
...they want me for tonight.

198
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,901
So I'll have to repack and go.

199
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,277
That didn't sound
like the Golden Nugget.

200
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,248
I'm worried. What happens
if we have to support Jerry?

201
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,721
-I'll have to go back to work.
-Where would you work?

202
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,248
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.

203
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,961
Well, Mr. Seinfeld, I'm not sure
I understand why you want a job here.

204
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,364
What's not to understand?

205
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,665
Well, for one thing,
you live in Florida.

206
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,601
I'm very comfortable
working out of the house.

207
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,540
I have a phone.
We have a Kinko's nearby.

208
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,743
You know, I think
that my résumé speaks for itself.

209
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,943
-Where is your résumé?
-I don't have it. I'll mail you one.

210
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,314
All right, Mr. Seinfeld...

211
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,923
...what kind of a position
did you have in mind?

212
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,753
-You sell clothes, don't you?
-Yeah.

213
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,988
Well, I sold raincoats
in the garment center for 38 years.

214
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,655
-ln 1 949--
-All right. All right. All right.

215
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,099
You come in tomorrow.
We'll find something for you to do.

216
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,101
You won't regret this, Ms. Benes.

217
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,001
What time should I be in?
I get up at 4.

218
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,971
I could be here as early as 4:25.

219
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,505
Oh, Elaine...

220
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,548
...this dry air is curing me
like a Black Forest ham.

221
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,850
Mr. Peterman? You're back.

222
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,785
Who's Mr. Fancy?

223
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,163
I was thinking maybe
I should spend the night.

224
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,564
Oh, that's sweet, but actually, l....

225
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,133
I think I'd prefer it if you left.

226
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,930
-What?
-You were completely right.

227
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,303
I sleep so much better
when I'm alone.

228
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,979
-And you scream in your sleep.
-I do?

229
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,777
There was a man. He was trying
to get into my apartment last night.

230
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,455
He was jiggling the doorknob
for 25 minutes.

231
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,160
-Come on. It was probably the wind.
-No, no.

232
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,193
No, it was a fearless cat burglar.

233
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,423
Now, listen, you gotta
let me sleep here.

234
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:24,831
I'll stay over here on my side,
and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth.

235
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,631
Because I don't wanna sleep alone.

236
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,298
Well, I do.

237
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,946
What took you so long?

238
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,381
I live in New York.

239
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,552
What the hell happened?

240
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,212
This thing is a behemoth.

241
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,858
What did you do?

242
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,154
I was making a simple lane change.

243
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,423
I put on the blinker,
and it took off on me.

244
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,692
And the next thing you know,
I was submerged.

245
00:13:55,868 --> 00:14:00,066
I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky
that those crocs didn't get me.

246
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,073
You are such an idiot.

247
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,874
Well, we got to get the car
cleaned up for my parents.

248
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,214
Do whatever you want. It's your car.

249
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,583
My car? You drove it
into the swamp.

250
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,749
It drove itself into the swamp.

251
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,886
Besides, I think I lost my pen too.

252
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,863
You know, that almost
makes this all worthwhile.

253
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,472
Why is there a Cadillac parked
in front of the house?

254
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,569
That's your mother's new car.

255
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,106
You bought that?

256
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,144
It's a coupe de elegance.

257
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,175
Your father wanted a Mercedes...

258
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,218
...but I won't ride in a German car.

259
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,456
Morning.

260
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,654
Oh, boy.

261
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,619
What the hell is going on here?

262
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,787
I had some trouble at my place.

263
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,593
So I need a little company
at night to sleep.

264
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:08,403
George, your mother and l
and Kramer have been talking.

265
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,701
-Oh, God.
-George...

266
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,538
...your parents can't blow
their savings in this community.

267
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:17,273
It's low-rent. We feel that Florida is
really the place where they should be.

268
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,577
You can drop a grand
in Disney World like that.

269
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,619
Wait a minute. You're moving
to Florida again?

270
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,452
Well, it's either that
or we stay here near you...

271
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,890
...and just sit on the money.

272
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,656
What do you think
we should do, Georgie?

273
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:41,132
So effective immediately, Ms. Benes
will return to her old position...

274
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,676
...at her original salary and l,
of course, will return to mine.

275
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,005
Kudos, Elaine, on a job...

276
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,169
...done.

277
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,149
What about my stock options?

278
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,218
I think not.

279
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,154
Now down to business.
I have had this vision...

280
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,815
...of a diaphanous rumrunner scarf.

281
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,860
Well, we could fly some fabric in
from our silk factories...

282
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,157
-...for about $1 000 dollars a bolt.
-A thousand?

283
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,563
I know a couple of Chinamen
over on 43rd Street...

284
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,000
-...that will do it for half that.
-It's, Asian Americans.

285
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,730
What?

286
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,501
Who are you?

287
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,166
-Don't worry--
-Morty Seinfeld.

288
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,473
I cut velvet for 40 years
with Harry Alper.

289
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,275
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, this is not--

290
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,680
Elaine, did you hire this man?

291
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:32,188
No, no-- Well, I mean, he's more
like an intern, you know, at best.

292
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,727
So if your parents move to Florida,
you're poor.

293
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,295
-But happy.
-Obviously.

294
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,992
And if they stay, you're rich, but....

295
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,132
Obviously.

296
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,765
It's quite a dilemma.

297
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,669
You know, I have
a bit of a dilemma of my own.

298
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,070
No, no, no.

299
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,871
We're staying on me.
We haven't solved anything yet.

300
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,879
All right. This is easy.
Just let them go. So now, listen--

301
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,244
What do you mean?
They're spending all my money.

302
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,648
All right. Then they stay.
Let me ask you a ques--

303
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,845
Could you put
a little thought into this?

304
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,049
Jerry's gone. You could humor me.
He humors me.

305
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,625
Speaking of Jerry...

306
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,890
...his father is driving me
so crazy down at Peterman's.

307
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,727
Know what I do when one of these
guys is breathing down my neck?

308
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,801
-What?
-You schedule a late meeting.

309
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,396
-What does that do?
-Old guys are up at 4 a.m.

310
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,097
By 2:30, they're wiped--
How did we get back on to you?

311
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,572
I gotta go.

312
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,509
You know I got nothing out of this.

313
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,282
-Hey, Frank.
-Yeah.

314
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,680
You got two beds in here.

315
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,447
That's right. That's me on the left.

316
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,318
So you sleep in separate beds.

317
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,288
Thirty years ago
we came to an agreement.

318
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,984
The only way
I could get some rest.

319
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,652
Really?

320
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,889
Estelle has got the jimmy arms.

321
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,924
You can get that in your arms?

322
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,262
Like you wouldn't believe.

323
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,040
Jerry, it's getting late.

324
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,874
You cleaned up the car.

325
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,477
You made all your phone calls.

326
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,238
Why are you still here?

327
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,578
Well, I maxed out my credit cards.

328
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,210
And I don't have enough cash
for a hotel room.

329
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,256
-So....
-You are thinking of staying here?

330
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,758
-Well....
-You've got some nerve.

331
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,421
I almost break my neck
in that deathtrap of yours...

332
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,658
...and now you ask me for a favor?

333
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,427
Didn't like that crack
about the pen?

334
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,332
I did not.

335
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,467
Well, I've given this
a lot of thought...

336
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,235
...and I've gotta say--

337
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,976
As much as I'd like to see
the two of you living it up...

338
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,948
...in a warm, tropical setting...

339
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,849
...I would just miss you too much.

340
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,512
So I've decided...

341
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,683
...I want you to stay.

342
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,459
It's too late.

343
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,563
We bought a condo
at Del Boca Vista.

344
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,562
We're leaving tonight.

345
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,969
You said it was my call.

346
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,264
We were just being nice.

347
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:05,803
Cosmo, are you sure you're
gonna be all right here alone?

348
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,173
Oh, yeah, I got Emily
coming over tonight.

349
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,008
You're letting him
have a woman over?

350
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,548
He's not family.
It's different psychologically.

351
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,681
And so I made an explosive
out of chickpeas.

352
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,362
And I stopped that great rhino
right in his tracks.

353
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,828
-It's getting late. Why don't we--
-Mr. Peterman...

354
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,026
...that can't have been the only time
that you faced mortal danger.

355
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,236
Funny you should ask, Elaine.

356
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,600
If we're gonna stay
till all hours of the night...

357
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,639
...can't we at least
get some food here?

358
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,007
It's only 5:1 5.

359
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,339
So later on that same day...

360
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,450
...I developed a great hankering
for some wild honey.

361
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,846
Okay, I'm done.

362
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,547
I'll be back in the morning when
he's close to finished with this story.

363
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,384
Morty.

364
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,084
My stories
are what sell these clothes.

365
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,593
Cheap fabric and dim lighting:

366
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,857
That's how you move merchandise.

367
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,533
Okay.

368
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,725
You're out.

369
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,767
I never knew what I was
peddling with those stupid cartoons...

370
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,135
...and that paper book anyway.

371
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,129
I don't know why I let you talk me
into that corned beef at Snitzers.

372
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,929
-No one held a gun to your head.
-Yeah.

373
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,436
Don't forget: We're eating
at the Fidermans' tomorrow.

374
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,598
Why do I have to go?
They're your friends.

375
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,868
-You like them.
-I've had it with them.

376
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,943
Then we won't go.

377
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,640
Okay, okay. What time?

378
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,813
Eight-thirty.

379
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,055
That was all right.

380
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,928
"One bright note in today's market
was the stock of retailer J. Peterman...

381
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,269
...whose founder's surprise return
generated a rise...

382
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,434
...of 1 2 and a half points."

383
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,511
That means if you still had
those stock options....

384
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,911
Yeah.

385
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,414
That's a shame.

386
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,478
What are you, sticking it to me?

387
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,454
-What?
-I think you're sticking it to me.

388
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,490
I'm sure George
is just being sympathetic.

389
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,889
Sticking it!

390
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,864
You're not alone.
I'm practically broke.

391
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,591
-Really?
-No.

392
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,133
But...

393
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,794
...I did blow over 20,000
on that Cadillac.

394
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,535
Delicious.

395
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,303
-You seem happy.
-Hey, the folks are 1 200 miles away.

396
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,412
I'm basking in the buffer zone.

397
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,343
Another piece of pie here.

398
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,181
So were your parents shocked
to see the Cadillac?

399
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,684
Actually, I haven't heard
from them yet.

400
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,446
When are we gonna tell Jerry?

401
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,090
I don't wanna worry him.

402
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,783
We'll tell him next time we go up.

403
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,890
He thought he could buy back
that Cadillac for us?

404
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,123
He's not getting away with that.

405
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,194
Besides, that condo
was too much house.

406
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,607
How many times
can you check the car?

407
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,040
I saw a bum sleeping
in the Cadillac the other day.

408
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:31,012
Why would someone
break into a car to take a nap?

409
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,117
They don't nap.
They make it their home.

410
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,912
They urinate in there.

411
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,850
You're driving me crazy.

412
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,582
That's it. We're going back
to Queens. Where's my hat?

413
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,817
No!
