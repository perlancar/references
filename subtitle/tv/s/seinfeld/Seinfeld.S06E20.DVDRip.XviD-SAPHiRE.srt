1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,734
These pest-control companies...

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,835
...call themselves exterminators,
but they can't really do it.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,774
The best they can do is get the bugs
to go to somebody else's house.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,936
They just relocate them.
You know what I mean?

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,049
They're bug realtors
is what they are.

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,778
"I think you'll be happy here. There's
a lot of crumbs, not much light.

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,952
They usually sleep through the night,
so you'll have your run of the place."

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,522
Nobody cares about killing insects.
Even animal-rights people don't care.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,323
You could probably walk
into an animal-rights meeting...

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,726
...and hear a speech like:

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,427
"The only way to stop the cruelty
of the scientific testing on animals...

12
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,832
Got him.

13
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,803
- Is to boycott these companies."

14
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,206
Anyway, it's funny.

15
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,714
Paula and I actually met
because of Elaine.

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,477
Elaine is in my drawing class.

17
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,713
- And I went there one day to see...
- A nude model.

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,556
- If Elaine wanted
to go get some coffee.

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,058
You know, I once went out
with a nude model.

20
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,458
Never let me see her naked.

21
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,089
Hundreds of people see her naked
every week except me.

22
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,099
Needless to say, it was quite vexing.

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,798
- Are you through?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,304
So I started to compliment Elaine
on her sketches...

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,276
...and it turns out they're Paula's.

26
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,946
George, I just like to doodle.

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,580
Dropped my napkin.

28
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,845
- Jerry.
- What?

29
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,648
- What are you doing?
- What?

30
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,587
She had those nuts in her mouth.
She just spit them out.

31
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,594
You... You ate these?

32
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,167
You sucked on these
and then put them on the plate?

33
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,395
Well, I didn't know
you were gonna eat them.

34
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,233
Still.

35
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,401
I'm sorry you find me so repulsive.

36
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,603
No, no, I don't.
I mean, don't be silly.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,270
- Yeah.
- It's just...

38
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,384
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll just go to the ladies' room.

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,110
I'll join you.

40
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,448
Oh, man, did you see that?

41
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,320
I ate discarded food.

42
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,793
- Well, I've done that.
- Yeah, but with you it's intentional.

43
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,324
- Havert you kissed her?
- But this is different.

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,594
This is like semi-digested foodstuff.

45
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,465
The next stop is the stomach,
and you can take it from there.

46
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,972
Oh, excuse me. Just a second.

47
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,406
Yeah, that's it.

48
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,641
Yeah, that's gonna make
a big difference.

49
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,714
Hey, this is dating.
You can't leave anything to chance.

50
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,852
You think Shelly's upset that I made
a big deal about the pecan?

51
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,343
Yeah.

52
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,017
- Thanks.
- No problem.

53
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,853
Well, Jerry, I guess
we should get going.

54
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,116
Oh, boy.

55
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,786
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Shelly.

56
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,331
And, Jerry, be careful,
there's a lot of nuts out there.

57
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,864
Do you have everything?

58
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,337
- Can you grab my purse?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,517
Yeah, so?

60
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,712
- Don't you see what this is?
- It's a doodle.

61
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,221
Yeah. A doodle of me.

62
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,725
Look at the size of the nose, the ears.
All my features are distorted.

63
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,193
Oh, it's an affectionate caricature.

64
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,159
I'm grotesque.

65
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,167
- I look like a troll.
- It's just a drawing.

66
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,970
Don't you see what this says?

67
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,438
How could you possibly like somebody
if you think they look like this?

68
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,836
Hello!

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,977
- What is with him?
- Usual.

70
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,545
So you know what?

71
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,313
My friend Judy recommended me
for a job at Viking Press.

72
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,979
- Hey, good for you.
- Yeah, but get this:

73
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,853
Viking has a deal
with the Plaza Hotel.

74
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,859
They've got a two-bedroom suite there
for out-of-town clients.

75
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,465
- So guess what I did?
- Oh, come on.

76
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,568
You told them you were from
out of town just to stay in the hotel?

77
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,864
I know. I know, Jerry,
but it's the Plaza.

78
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,371
I've never stayed there.
It'll be like a vacation.

79
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,669
Be sure to catch a Broadway show
while you're in town.

80
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,279
Listen, I used your parents' address
in Florida.

81
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,508
They're coming
into town tomorrow, by the way.

82
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,419
- Hey, what's this?
- Don't ask.

83
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,717
What, is it a drawing of Mr. Magoo?

84
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,091
No, it's George.

85
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,458
It is.

86
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,434
Are you enjoying yourself?

87
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,207
- I'm sorry.
- You see? You see?

88
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,844
Listen, when is your next
drawing class?

89
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,001
Tomorrow.

90
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,409
- I want you to do me a favor.
- What?

91
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,812
I want you to find out
if she likes me.

92
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,612
Find out if she likes you?
What, are you in high school?

93
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,888
George, come on. Can't you just,
like, talk to her yourself?

94
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,458
Then she's gonna know that I like her
more than she likes me.

95
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,686
My parents are coming,
and I've gotta clean up.

96
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,491
So if you and Potsie
are done scheming...

97
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,030
Well, they're in.

98
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,005
- What's in?
- The Mackinaw peaches, Jerry.

99
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,975
The Mackinaw peaches!

100
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,812
Right, the ones from Oregon that are
only ripe for two weeks a year?

101
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,215
Yeah, that's right.
I split a case with Newman.

102
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,014
I wait all year for these.

103
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,919
Oh, this is fantastic.

104
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,951
Makes your taste buds come alive.

105
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,924
It's like having a circus
in your mouth.

106
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,291
- Take a taste.
- No.

107
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,830
- Take a taste.
- I don't want it.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,299
- Come on, just take a taste.
- I don't want it!

109
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,037
I'm not gonna taste your peach.

110
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,868
I ate someone's pecan last night.
I'm not eating your peach.

111
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,978
Jerry, this is a miracle of nature
that exists for a brief period.

112
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,274
It's like the aurora borealis.

113
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,787
- Holy cow, what is this?
- What?

114
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,856
- I think I got flea bites.
- Flea bites?

115
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,619
Yeah. Look at this.
My ankle's all bitten up.

116
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,755
You got a dog?

117
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,095
No.

118
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,097
Well, that is strange.

119
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,932
How can I have fleas?

120
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,796
Don't sweat it, buddy.
I used to have fleas.

121
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,273
- What did you do about them?
- What do you mean?

122
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,810
- Hey, Jerry. How you doing?
- Hey!

123
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,505
- Kramer.
- Hi, Jerry.

124
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,943
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

125
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,212
Jerry, I'm your mother.
Now, what is it?

126
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,049
Mom, Dad...

127
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,248
...I have fleas.

128
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,721
Paula, I hear you've been going out
with George Costanza.

129
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,595
- How did you know?
- Everybody knows.

130
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,736
George told me he thinks
you're totally cute and everything.

131
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,928
He said that?

132
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,368
- Do you like George?
- Yeah. He's cool.

133
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,811
No, I mean, do you like him
or do you "like him" like him?

134
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,476
"Like" like. Looks aren't
that important to me, you know?

135
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,713
Ms. Benes, are you chewing gum?

136
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,932
Yep. They're in your bedroom too,
Mr. Seinfeld.

137
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,269
You got a full-blown outbreak of fleas
on your hands.

138
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,273
I don't get it. How did this happen?
I don't have a dog.

139
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,110
I don't explain them, Mr. Seinfeld.
I just exterminate them.

140
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,018
I don't understand this.

141
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,848
I'm gonna have to seal the place up
for 48 hours and fog it.

142
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,319
Only way to get rid of them.

143
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,520
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours?
I got my parents in town.

144
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,024
Well, unless you wanna kill them...

145
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,256
...they can't stay in here.

146
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,525
This stuff is pretty toxic.

147
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,330
- I'll go get my stuff. It's in the truck.
- Okay.

148
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,602
- How you doing?
- Hi.

149
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,074
Bug guy.

150
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,804
- Why do you have a bug guy?
- I have fleas.

151
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,279
Fleas?

152
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,314
- How did you get fleas?
- I don't know.

153
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,680
Everyone's gotta clear
the apartment for two days.

154
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,651
I don't know what to do
with my parents.

155
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,517
They'll never let me pay for a hotel.

156
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,489
If they go someplace on their own,
it'll be some awful dump.

157
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,991
Have you checked
into the Plaza yet?

158
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,687
No.

159
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:19,889
Oh, no.

160
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,193
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, no, no, no.

161
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,996
- My parents, my parents.
- No, no, no... Okay!

162
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,002
Good.

163
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

164
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,903
Come up.

165
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,341
What about you?
Where are you gonna stay?

166
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,879
I'm gonna ask Shelly,
but she still might be upset...

167
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,448
...about the masticated
pecan incident.

168
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,786
Hey, I found out from Paula,
she likes George.

169
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,947
- I bet he'll be relieved.
- When he's dead, he'll be relieved.

170
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,221
By the way, Viking Press sent
a FedEx for you to my parents.

171
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,555
They brought it with them.

172
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,460
Yeah, that's just some stuff
about the company.

173
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,759
- Hey, did you talk to Paula?
- Yeah.

174
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,930
- So, what did she say?
- She likes you.

175
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,769
She said she liked me?

176
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,410
- She said that?
- Yep.

177
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,012
Those were her exact words,
"I like George"?

178
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,943
Yep.

179
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,016
How do you like that?
How do you like that?

180
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:16,211
You see, I get myself into a tizzy,
I'm all worked up, and for what?

181
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,548
For nothing.

182
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,782
In fact, she said looks
werert that important.

183
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,120
You see... What?

184
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,158
She said...?

185
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,134
She said looks aren't
that important to her?

186
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,464
- Let me rephrase that. She...
- She thinks I'm ugly.

187
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,270
I knew it.

188
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,808
See, the thing of it is...

189
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,742
...there's a lot of ugly people
out there walking around...

190
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,250
...but they don't know they're ugly
because nobody actually tells them.

191
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,015
So, what's your point?

192
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,522
- I don't... I don't know.
- Okay.

193
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:58,096
The point, George, is she likes you.

194
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,663
Oh, so what?

195
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,426
I'd rather she hate me
and thought I was good-Iooking.

196
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,503
Then at least I could get
somebody else.

197
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,570
- What is this? Why am I itching?
- That would be the fleas.

198
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,909
- Hey.
- Hey, how do you like this?

199
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,382
Oh, my God.

200
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,680
Morty, let's go. This is too nice.

201
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,450
Hey, this is the kind of room
Sinatra stays in.

202
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,289
Hey, look, macadamia nuts.

203
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,862
- Macadamia nuts?
- Yeah.

204
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,659
You know what these cost?
They're like 80 cents a nut.

205
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,599
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Yeah. It's all taken care of.

206
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,537
Hey, they got a phone
in the john here.

207
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,567
Judy.

208
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,974
- Hey.
- Hi.

209
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,240
Thank you for recommending me
to Viking Press.

210
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:54,147
It is my pleasure. Just make sure
you give that manuscript a good read.

211
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,412
Manuscript?

212
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,019
Yeah, I'm sure they FedExed you
a manuscript.

213
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,317
They want to see you read
an unpublished work...

214
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,018
...and give insightful criticism.

215
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,628
Read it twice if you have to.

216
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,995
- This is a big step in your career.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

217
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,432
- Hey, what about lunch?
- I gotta go.

218
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,432
- Thank God I found you.
- Oh, hey.

219
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,041
Do you still have that FedEx?

220
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,973
In the apartment. But we can't go in.
It's being fumigated.

221
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,013
I'll take my chances.
Come on, come on.

222
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,184
- You see?
- Jerry, I need that FedEx right now.

223
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,685
I told you to take it.

224
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,585
I didn't know that it was a manuscript
that I had to read.

225
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,057
Well, you can't go in there.
It's like a gas chamber in there.

226
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,820
Hey, buddy.

227
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,057
I left a Mackinaw peach
in your refrigerator.

228
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,202
Kramer, they're fumigating.
There's toxic gas in there.

229
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,330
- Toxic gas?
- Oh, you'll be fine.

230
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,771
- You were there a couple minutes?
- An hour and a half.

231
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,534
I was reading a manuscript.
I just couldn't put it down.

232
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,704
- My manuscript?
- How do you feel?

233
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,907
Well, now that you mention it,
a little woozy.

234
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,178
You've gotta go back in
and grab my manuscript.

235
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,753
- I'm not going back.
- All right, then where is it?

236
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,949
I left it on the coffee table
or something.

237
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,319
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

238
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,021
Didrt you see the sign
on the door?

239
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,496
I thought it was so your parents
wouldn't walk in...

240
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,259
...while you were with a girl.

241
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,097
It's not on any table, Kramer.
Where is it?

242
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,757
I don't know.
I was in the bathroom, the kitchen.

243
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,096
Okay, bathroom, kitchen.

244
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,171
Could you get me a soda?

245
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,609
Jerry, I had some milk.
I made a sandwich.

246
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,144
I gotta get out of the building.

247
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,892
I couldn't find it anywhere.

248
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,763
- How did you get fleas anyway?
- I don't know.

249
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,632
Who could have been
in my apartment?

250
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,898
I looked everywhere...

251
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,871
...but all I could find were these
stupid Chunky wrappers.

252
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,534
Wait a second.
Did you say Chunky wrappers?

253
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,145
- Yeah.
- Let me see those.

254
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:43,245
Oh, I know the chunky
that left these Chunkys.

255
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,184
Newman!

256
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,689
I've got him.

257
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,429
Newman! Open the door, Newman.
I know you're in there.

258
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,198
Hello, Jerry.

259
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,331
What a pleasant surprise.

260
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,874
There's nothing pleasant about it.
Just cut the crap.

261
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,706
You gave me fleas.
I know it and you know it.

262
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,144
Fleas?

263
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,514
That's preposterous.
How could I give you fleas?

264
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,020
- Now, if you don't mind...
- Oh, but I do.

265
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,456
There's probably fleas
crawling all over your little snack bar.

266
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,862
So you have fleas.

267
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,900
Maybe you keep your house
in a state of disrepair.

268
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,095
Maybe you live in squalor.

269
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,968
You know, Newman,
the thing about fleas...

270
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,838
...is that they irritate the skin.

271
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,003
And they start to itch.

272
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,378
Oh, maybe you can hold out
five seconds or 10.

273
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,951
Maybe 15 or 20.

274
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,883
But after a while...

275
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,990
...no matter how much willpower
a person may have...

276
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,216
...it won't matter...

277
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,329
...because they're crawling,
crawling on your skin.

278
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,227
Up your legs, up your spine,
up your back...

279
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,961
All right, I've got them!
I'm rife with fleas!

280
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,304
Oh, that feels good.

281
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,875
Hey, this guy charges
100 bucks an hour...

282
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,774
...but I'm telling you,
he's won'th every penny.

283
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,107
I'm next.

284
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,740
Hey, Leo, get this.
I'm watching four movies at once.

285
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,853
Pay-per-view.

286
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,852
I love these nuts.

287
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,220
This champagne's gone flat.

288
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,727
Nana.

289
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,160
Let the chambermaid clean it up.

290
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,998
- Hello.
- What's the matter?

291
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,099
- Well, I spoke to Elaine...
- Hey, look, no shave.

292
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,765
No. Why should that make
any difference to you?

293
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,968
It doesn't.

294
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,272
Of course not.
You don't care what I look like.

295
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,138
That's right, I don't.

296
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,012
I suppose I could pull this out
and walk around like this...

297
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,413
...and you wouldn't care.

298
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,281
Not a whit.

299
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,220
I suppose we could go
to Lincoln Center...

300
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,382
...and I could wear
sneakers and jeans.

301
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,427
- You could wear sweatpants.
- I could?

302
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:09,158
You could drape yourself in velvet
for all I care.

303
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,834
Velvet?

304
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,671
- Did you read the whole thing?
- Oh, yeah.

305
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,367
Yeah? So, what's it about?

306
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,410
Well, it's a story...

307
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,573
...about love, deception,
greed, lust...

308
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,686
...and unbridled enthusiasm.

309
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,186
Unbridled enthusiasm?

310
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,655
That's what led
to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.

311
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,020
Oh, boy.

312
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:39,028
You see, Elaine,
Billy was a simple country boy...

313
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,361
...you might say
a cockeyed optimist...

314
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,968
...who got himself mixed up
in the high-stakes game...

315
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,503
...of world diplomacy
and international intrigue.

316
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,937
- Oh, my God.
- Well, here we go.

317
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,772
Could I have a Scotch on the rocks?

318
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,441
- May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.

319
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,104
All right.

320
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,848
What is this?

321
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,181
- What? What are you...?
- I can't taste this.

322
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,721
- What are you talking about?
- Well, this food, it has no taste.

323
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,357
Nothing. I'm getting nothing.

324
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,256
What?

325
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,627
It must be the toxic gas
from the fumigation.

326
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,232
What?

327
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,804
- Thanks for letting me stay here.
- I don't keep pecans in the house...

328
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,242
...so I didn't think there would
be a problem.

329
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,574
Oh, damn.

330
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,114
- What's the matter?
- I forgot my toothbrush.

331
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,184
Oh, no problem.

332
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,547
You can use mine.

333
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,817
Yours?

334
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,582
You know what? I'll brush later.

335
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,226
Brush now.

336
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,825
Sure.

337
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,907
Newman, let me have a bite
of your Mackinaw.

338
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,876
- What for, you got your own.
- Come on, I need to taste it.

339
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,742
Yeah.

340
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,751
Nothing. I can't even taste
a Mackinaw.

341
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,890
- Well, that's a shame.
- Wait all year, and I can't taste them.

342
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,150
You can't taste them,
why waste them?

343
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,692
Why not give them all to me?

344
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,833
It's a story about love, deception...

345
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,835
...greed, lust...

346
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,539
...and unbridled enthusiasm.

347
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,200
Unbridled enthusiasm?

348
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,710
Yeah, yeah. That's right.

349
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:41,478
That's what led to
Billy Mumphrey's downfall.

350
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,579
Interesting take.

351
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,384
So you believe that
had he not been so enthusiastic...

352
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,959
...he could have averted disaster.

353
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,053
Yes. Yes, that's right.

354
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,563
You see...

355
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,964
You see, Billy Mumphrey
was a simple country boy...

356
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,697
...some might say
a cockeyed optimist...

357
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,899
...who got caught
up in the dirty game...

358
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,842
...of world diplomacy
and international intrigue.

359
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,813
So it was more a question of attitude
than politics.

360
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,452
Yes. Yes, Mr. Mandel.

361
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,316
Hey, Under Siege is on again.

362
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,049
Who's up for it?

363
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,826
No more nuts.

364
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,874
Oh, my God.

365
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,036
What the hell is this?

366
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,477
Don't tell me. Velvet?

367
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,220
It's the real deal.

368
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,520
She's seen you in this thing?

369
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,251
That's right. We just had sex.

370
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,292
You know, Jerry, I've been searching
for someone a long time.

371
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,559
Well, the search is over.

372
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,727
And now the search
for the right psychiatrist begins.

373
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,369
So, what's with the suitcase?

374
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,404
She threw me out.

375
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,547
- Why?
- I wouldn't use her toothbrush.

376
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:21,176
- So where you staying?
- I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.

377
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:27,157
Three hours of massage time,
12 in-room movies...

378
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,784
...including several adult features...

379
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,495
...five shoeshines...

380
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,031
...and $400 won'th of snacks.

381
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,567
Not to mention the damage
to the room.

382
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,434
Mr. Mandel, you don't understand.
My friend had fleas.

383
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,838
I ran into the gas.
It could have killed me.

384
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,410
My other friend couldn't taste
his peaches.

385
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,843
They're only good for two weeks.

386
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,009
I think you've read one too many
Billy Mumphrey stories.

387
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,418
- Good day, Ms. Benes.
- Okay, good day.

388
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,759
- Hi, George.
- Hi.

389
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,061
This is fantastic.

390
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,697
- Ever had a Mackinaw peach?
- Oh, yeah. I love those.

391
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,001
Well, too bad. It's all done.

392
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,526
Yes. Yes, it's back.
I can taste again.

393
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,993
- What's the date?
- Fifteenth.

394
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,827
Fifteenth. Yes! Last day for
the Mackinaws. I can still make it.

395
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,759
Wait, Newman. Newman, wait.

396
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,337
Sorry. Last one.

397
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,168
But if you want to suck the pit...

398
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,138
Look, Beauford. It's the mailman.

399
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,849
You remember the mailman,
don't you?

400
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,179
- Kramer, don't.
- Get him!

401
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,504
Hello? Is anybody here...?

402
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,316
They said they were sending over
an Asian woman.

403
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,283
Oh, my God.
