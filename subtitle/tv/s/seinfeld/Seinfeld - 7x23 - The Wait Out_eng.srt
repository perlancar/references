1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,992
The concept of being separated
is strange.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,991
It's like you're engaged
to be divorced.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,197
"We're gonna try and make
not being together work.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,999
First we were separated, then we met,
then we were together.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,071
Now we're gonna try
being separated again.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,676
We think actually some sort of giant
rubber band might be the solution."

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,592
Of course, when you were
a kid in school...

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,955
...you'd get separated
for having too good a time.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,395
"If you two kids don't stop laughing
and having fun...

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,391
...l'm gonna have to separate you."

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,355
Then the kid finds out his parents
are breaking up...

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,274
...thinks it's because they got caught
fooling around, which is probably true.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,831
- Hairdo?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,195
You look like Brenda Starr.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,514
- Is that good?
- Better than Dondi.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,111
Hey, my God, look at that.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,872
It's David and Beth Lukner.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,555
You know, I heard a rumour
their marriage is a little rocky.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,598
Really? You know, I have
a little thing for Beth Lukner.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,113
Well...

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,910
I have to admit I've always thought
David was kind of sponge-worthy.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,272
Yeah, I've been waiting out
their marriage for three years.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,034
Me too. Well, I've been waiting out
two or three marriages...

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,395
...but this is the one I really
had my eye on.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,591
This car out there is taking up
like three parking spaces.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,352
That's mine.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,792
- You have a car?
- My friend lent it to me for the week.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,951
- She's out of town.
- I've never seen you drive.

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,712
- Me neither.
- Jerry?

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,713
- Elaine, hi.
- Hi, David.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,029
Hi, Beth.

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,035
Oh, George,
this is my husband, David.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,519
- Oh, hi, David.
- Hello.

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,148
George, you're the one who works
for the Yankees, right?

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,639
Yeah. Why, what do you do?

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,951
Well, I sell insurance, but Beth
used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,314
- Really?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,669
A physician married to a salesman.

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,752
I gotta tell you, Beth, you could have
done a lot better than him.

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,271
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, Mickey, what's going on?

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,193
I'm nervous. I'm auditioning to be
in the Actors Studio tonight.

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,148
- Really?
- It's Method, Jerry. It's intense.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,276
- Kramer's my scene partner.
- Kramer?

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,839
He doesn't have to say anything.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,116
He just has to sit there.
I'm playing a detective.

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,236
I'm playing a businessman
accused of murder.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,753
Oh, boy.

48
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,956
I gotta meet Elaine
and run some errands, so...

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,833
Look at this, Mickey.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,353
These pants are falling apart.

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,875
When I met you, you used
to wear jeans all the time.

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,598
Well, I was a different man then.

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,751
With a different body.

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,953
Hey, I got the body of a taut,
preteen Swedish boy.

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,671
I don't know.

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,957
What are you thinking? You think that
I'm not able to wear jeans anymore?

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,556
Is that what you're saying?
Because I'll go and I'll buy some jeans.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,030
I swear to God, I will.

59
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,072
Don't think I won't, Jerry.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,310
All right. That's it.

61
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,519
God, it is so great to drive again.

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,035
I miss it so much.

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,996
How about a left turn signal,
you moron!

64
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,998
I'm so nauseous.

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,639
She's the worst driver.

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,395
You know what,
on my first road test, I hit a dog.

67
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,359
I think it was a golden retriever.

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,431
No, no, no, it was a yellow lab.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,635
I gotta check my messages.

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,439
Hey.

71
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,991
I'm so carsick I'm gonna v omit.

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,874
Oh, my God, Jerry.

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,512
My friend Kim called.

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,750
David and Beth
got separated last night.

75
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,639
- Yeah?
- They're getting divorced!

76
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,430
So now, what is our move?
What do we do?

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,397
I don't know,
but we don't have much time.

78
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,790
City's teeming with people
waiting out that marriage.

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,234
Right.

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,868
It's like when a tenant dies
in a rent-controlled building.

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,712
You gotta take immediate action.

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,554
But David and Beth are gonna need
their grieving time.

83
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,359
Their grieving time is a luxury
I can't afford.

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm calling Beth tonight,
and if you want a shot at David...

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,798
...I suggest you do likewise.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,633
But we gotta make it seem like
we're not calling for dates.

87
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,438
Then why are we calling?

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,072
- Good question. Why are we calling?
- Why are we calling?

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,279
- Calling, calling, calling.
- Why are we calling? Why do we call?

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,191
I got it. I've got it.

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,477
We're calling just to say:

92
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,598
"I'm there for you."

93
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,759
I'm there for you.

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,469
Then, after a period
of being there for you...

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,077
...we slowly remove
the two words "for you"...

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,915
...and we're just there.

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,154
- Hey.
- Hey.

98
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,072
Remember Beth and David
from yesterday?

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,310
- They got separated.
- Really?

100
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,790
Well, you don't think it had anything
to do with what I said, do you?

101
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,669
What did you say?

102
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,912
You know, that thing
about her being too good for him.

103
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,675
I mean, I was just being folksy.
They could tell I was being folksy?

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,718
- Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
- Totally folksy.

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,591
Hey...

106
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,712
- What did you get?
- I bought dungarees.

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,916
Kramer, they're painted on.

108
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,632
Well, they're the slim fit.

109
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,438
- Slim fit?
- Yeah, they're streamlined.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,309
You're walking like Frankenstein.

111
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,959
They just gotta be worked in
a little bit, that's all.

112
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,559
See you.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,556
Well, David, it happens.

114
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,518
Sure, Beth, these things happen.

115
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,797
So have you told many people yet?

116
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,633
Because it's really
nobody's business.

117
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,360
Anyway, I just called
to tell you that...

118
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,476
...l'm there for you.

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,155
There is...

120
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
...anywhere you want me to be.

121
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,992
Sure. Dinner would be fine.

122
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,994
And I can just be there for you.

123
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,832
- Jerry, you gotta help me.
- What's wrong?

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,719
I can't get my pants off.
Mickey's audition is in 20 minutes.

125
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,235
I'm supposed to be a businessman.
I gotta be in costume.

126
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,709
All right. Undo them,
I'll help you get them off.

127
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,917
- I already did, and it won't come off.
- You just gotta wiggle your hips.

128
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,638
Pull down.

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,558
All right. All right.
That's no good.

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,676
Let me try getting them
from the bottom.

131
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,353
Just give me...

132
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
Wait. Jerry, wait a minute.

133
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,390
Man, these are tight.

134
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,393
- Squinch your hips in.
- I am squinching my hips.

135
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,033
Keep squinching them.

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,309
All right, that's not gonna work.
That's not gonna work.

137
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,710
Let me just think for a second here.

138
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,916
You better get me.

139
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,876
Get me up, get me up.

140
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,712
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

141
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,917
Look, you're gonna need the
Jaws of Life to get out of those things.

142
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,718
I don't have time.
I'm gonna be late.

143
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,872
- Maybe you could soak in a tub.
- You better get the door.

144
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,873
It was nice to get your call.

145
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,237
Well, I just want you to know
I'm there for you.

146
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,959
Of course, now I'm here for you...

147
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,350
...but when I'm not here for you,
I'm there for you.

148
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,918
Well, wherever you are,
I appreciate it.

149
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,354
So how did this all happen?

150
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,674
Well, actually, it had a lot to do
with George's comment.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,436
- Is that right?
- I thought maybe I could do better.

152
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,073
Maybe, maybe.

153
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,719
Well, it wasn't just that.

154
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,677
I realized after
three years of marriage...

155
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,229
...that David's little quirks
were getting on my nerves.

156
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,517
Three years is a long time
to be married.

157
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,713
In the middle of our fight last night,
he did this thing that he always does...

158
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,713
...where he asks questions
to himself aloud...

159
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,074
...and then answers them.

160
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,630
Am I happy Beth left me?
Of course not.

161
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,519
Can I hope to pick up the pieces
and move on? Absolutely.

162
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,355
You're gonna pick up the pieces.

163
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,556
We just had
our third anniversary on April 8th.

164
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,675
- Tenth.
- Right.

165
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,114
Right.

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,431
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
this whole thing is George's fault.

167
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,275
Well, David, the thing
about George is that...

168
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,670
...he's an idiot.

169
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,193
All right. Auditioning next
is Mickey Abbott...

170
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,190
...doing a scene from
the Terence Klufer play...

171
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,713
...Flesh Wounds in lthaca.

172
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,509
I'm sorry, my scene partner
isn't here yet so I guess...

173
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,878
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's with the jeans?

174
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,553
- You're a businessman.
- Long story.

175
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,517
Well, just get up here.

176
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,357
So, Bradley...

177
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,318
...I guess this is the last place
you expected to find yourself.

178
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,438
Well, we're gonna be here a while,
so take a seat.

179
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,069
If it hadn't been
for that secretary of yours...

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,953
I said, sit down.

181
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,119
Are you deaf, Bradley?
I said, sit down.

182
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,076
Bradley, it's very important
that you sit down.

183
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,352
Now, for the last time...

184
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,399
...try again to sit down!

185
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,279
Sit down, you big, stupid ape!

186
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,640
Did I have a great time with
David Lukner last night?

187
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,229
I sure did.

188
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,956
Do I think there's a future here?

189
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,792
I don't see why not.

190
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,353
I'll tell you, that "there for you" crap
was a stroke of genius.

191
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,196
- Oh, please.
- Never mind.

192
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,634
- Oh, come on.
- You're a genius.

193
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,153
All right.

194
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,593
Hey.

195
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,228
- Georgie!
- Hey, there he is!

196
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,630
Georgie boy!

197
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,639
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

198
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,950
You're the man of the hour,
that's what's going on.

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,394
- Right.
- What do you mean?

200
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,791
Well, thanks to you and your little
comment there to David and Beth...

201
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,474
...Jerry and I
are in prime pouncing position...

202
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,077
...to scoop these two up
before they know what hit them.

203
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,871
So it was my comment
that broke them up?

204
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,832
- According to them.
- Yeah.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,956
I feel terrible.

206
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,793
I can't be responsible
for breaking up a marriage.

207
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,313
- Oh, no.
- Where are you going?

208
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,072
Well, I gotta go talk to Beth.

209
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,151
- Talk to Beth?
- I gotta undo what I did.

210
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,470
You're not undoing anything.

211
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,631
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Oh, no, you're not.

212
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,472
All right, get out of my way.

213
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,514
All right, don't make me
get physical here!

214
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,438
You be careful, George.

215
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,038
- George.
- Hi, Beth.

216
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,595
Anyway, Jerry told me that...

217
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,230
...it might have been my comment
in the coffee shop that broke you up.

218
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,078
Well, you know,
it's funny, George...

219
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,993
...sometimes you don't know
how you're feeling about something...

220
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,197
...until a person like you comes along
and articulates it so perfectly.

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,752
Articulate?

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,079
Me? I've never articulated anything.
I'm completely incoherent.

223
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,312
I don't know about that.

224
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,074
Hold on. Hello.

225
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,673
Hi.

226
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,832
Yeah, last night. I did too.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,878
Really? That's so funny,
he's here right now.

228
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,792
Can you put him on?
I'd love to say hello.

229
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,633
Sure. George, it's Jerry.

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,671
- He wants to talk to me?
- Yeah.

231
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,957
- He says he wants to say hello.
- Sweet guy.

232
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,152
Hello?

233
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,198
What the hell are you doing
over there?

234
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,794
Mind your own business.
Now, stay out of my affairs!

235
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,791
Jerry, Jerry,
that is so sweet of you...

236
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,951
...but actually, I already ate.

237
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,872
Ate? What the hell
are you talking about?

238
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,837
Listen to me.
Get out of that apartment.

239
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,669
- lf you screw this up for me, I swear...
- Chocolate chip mint?

240
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,190
Actually, Jerry,
I prefer chocolate chip.

241
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,555
What is it about the chocolate
and the mint...

242
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,915
...that makes it go so well together?

243
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,158
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, of course you can use it. Sure.

244
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,756
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Don't hang up on me, George, l...

245
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,476
- Hey.
- Hey.

246
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,915
Are you still wearing those things?

247
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,229
Oh, yeah.

248
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,960
Yeah, I think they're starting
to loosen up a bit.

249
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,760
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Zanfino.
- Kramer, would you do me a favour?

250
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,957
My babysitter hasn't shown up.
Could you watch Joey for an hour?

251
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,155
Yeah, sure, Mrs. Zanfino.

252
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,914
He's sleeping already.
You don't have to do anything.

253
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,595
- See you later, buddy.
- See you later.

254
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,311
- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry. It's Beth.

255
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,357
- Oh, hi, Beth.
- Hi.

256
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,551
I've been doing
a lot of thinking today...

257
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,473
...and I don't know,
maybe I made a huge mistake.

258
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,872
- George.
- I'm just feeling very confused.

259
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,512
- I'll call you back, okay?
- Okay.

260
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,549
- Trouble.
- What?

261
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,039
- George. Yeah.
- Is it? Damn.

262
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,633
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

263
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,711
You get your ass
over to Beth's tout de suite.

264
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,348
Turn on some of that so-called charm
you tell me about.

265
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,797
- Yeah, I can try and do that.
- You don't try, you do it.

266
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,997
I got the loser in this relationship.
I'm breathing new life into him.

267
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,720
Give me three more days,
he won't remember her name.

268
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,393
You got the winner, the easy part.

269
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,636
Let's go. I'll drive you over there.
Come on.

270
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,633
- You go on ahead. I'll take the bus.
- What? I'm parked outside.

271
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,234
- I'll take the subway.
- It doesn't matter. I'll take you.

272
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,038
- I can hitchhike.
- What's your problem?

273
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,236
- It's really not necessary.
- What's your problem?

274
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,592
The...

275
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,035
The shoelaces
that you bought me...

276
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,111
...they worked out well.

277
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,628
Well, you know,
if you need some more...

278
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,791
...I can get them for you.

279
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,349
It should be a while, though.

280
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,517
That was close.

281
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,032
Confide in her. Open up to her.

282
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,394
You know, women like that.

283
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,916
I don't feel so good.

284
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,954
Anyway, Beth...

285
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,031
You know, I was thinking
on my way over...

286
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,397
...how when I was 9,
I wanted these handball sneakers.

287
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,913
They were all black.

288
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,469
But they only came in adult sizes.

289
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,638
So, you know,
I never got the sneakers.

290
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,119
Oh, really?

291
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,510
My father left us when I was 9...

292
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,275
...so I guess that's why
I have such a fear of abandonment.

293
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,557
- Wow, that's so touching.
- Yes, it is.

294
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,634
Hey, it's George.

295
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,109
Oh, maybe we should go
someplace else.

296
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,474
No, let's go in.

297
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,349
- Oh, hi. Hi, David.
- Hi, George.

298
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,476
- Elaine.
- Hi.

299
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,757
Listen, David, I want to apologize
about that comment...

300
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,150
George, please, please. I'm fine.

301
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,912
Oh, yeah, this is my fiancée.

302
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,718
- Susan, this is David.
- David.

303
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,435
Oh, fiancée? Boy, you could've
done a lot better than him.

304
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,150
Come on, Elaine, let's go.

305
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,994
It's Frankenstein! It's Frankenstein!

306
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,673
Joey.

307
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,754
Joey.

308
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,755
Mickey, you were so incredible
in that scene yesterday.

309
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,638
- The rage.
- Right.

310
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,677
The rage. Tons of rage.

311
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,037
I don't believe this.

312
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,194
- Hello.
- Mickey.

313
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,509
Oh, hi, Kramer.

314
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,274
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- You gotta do me a favour.

315
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,034
- What? Now? I can't.
- Hey, you owe me.

316
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,593
I got you in the Actors Studio.

317
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,432
They thought what we did
was the scene.

318
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,909
All right, all right. I'll be right over.

319
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,993
You ready?

320
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,397
You know what, George...

321
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,391
...why don't you go ahead.

322
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,320
I think I'd like
to be alone for a while.

323
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,353
Oh, sure.

324
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,034
Sure, you want to be alone?
Sure, I understand that.

325
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,555
You want a little time to think?
Think. Ponder things.

326
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,438
You know, ruminate.

327
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,352
You go ahead.
A lot of stuff on your mind.

328
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,748
You think things out. Think.

329
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,230
Mull, just mull. Do a lot of mulling.

330
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,748
I gotta go find this kid.

331
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,388
All you gotta do is lay here
and pretend you're asleep...

332
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,357
...in case she gets back.
Here, the covers.

333
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,750
Why don't you just cut the pants
and get them off.

334
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,480
- I'm breaking them in.
- What am I gonna do in here?

335
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,234
Just keep the lights out
and your eyes closed. I'll be back.

336
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,836
Jerry, Jerry!

337
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,959
Jerry, Jerry, the most
unbelievable thing has happened.

338
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,269
It is so unbelievable!

339
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,749
I'm sitting in the coffee shop,
I'm talking to Susan...

340
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,638
...we're talking
about shoelaces... right?

341
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,713
So in walks David, right?
He walks right up to the table, right?

342
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,519
I introduce him to Susan,
and he says... Now, get this.

343
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,240
He says, " Boy, you could do
a lot better than this guy."

344
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,036
He said the exact same thing
that I said to him...

345
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,394
...just to get back at me.

346
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,270
And then she says she wants
to be alone for a while. Alone, Jerry.

347
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,876
I think that she thinks
that she could do better.

348
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,473
Do you appreciate this?

349
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,914
You see the irony of this?

350
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,593
You see what's going on here?

351
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,269
What's the matter?

352
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,271
I'm nauseous.

353
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,032
That what's hurting
your appreciation?

354
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,269
A little.

355
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,953
It's a good story,
don't you think?

356
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,109
- It's not bad.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,510
Joey, there you are. Hey, Joey!

358
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,272
It's a monster!

359
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,510
I'm the babysitter.

360
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,878
Good night, honey.

361
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,873
Good night.

362
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,748
It's gotta have
something to do with Kramer.

363
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,794
Elaine...

364
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,438
...here's to you being there.

365
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,272
And here.

366
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,992
Excuse me.

367
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,912
- Beth.
- David.

368
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,679
I'll tell you, it's not bad.

369
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,919
- George?
- Yeah?

370
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,311
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

371
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,799
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the wedding and all...

372
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,272
...and I've decided
to go with the chicken.

373
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,199
So chasing little kids, huh?
You're in a lot of trouble, mister.

374
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,868
- No, look, I was babysitting...
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

375
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,598
Sit down.

376
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,750
What are you, deaf?
I said, sit down.

377
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,713
- Hey, for the last time, sit down.
- Oh, yeah.
