1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,464
Excuse me.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,574
I'll be with you in a minute.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,337
No, you should have come
last night.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,412
It was fun.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,277
I just have a question.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,079
I know. The margaritas
in that place are so strong.

7
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,415
Hello.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,081
I'd like to buy these huaraches.

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,323
So, what else is going on?

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,693
Hey!

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,665
Listen, I'll call you back.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,364
Yes? What can I do for you?

13
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,033
Nothing. You just lost a customer.

14
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,685
Ready? I don't want to miss
the previews.

15
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,619
Me neither. I love the previews.

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,657
In fact, I enjoy being
the theater cutup.

17
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:05,059
Last week after a preview,
I yelled out, "Must miss!"

18
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,894
I think that I was in that theater.
That was really funny.

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,593
Yeah, I got a good laugh.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,434
Let me just check
my messages before we go.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,912
-So you're on the speed dial?
-After two dates.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,912
-What number?
-Seven.

23
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,954
Wow! You know,
it's a pain to change that.

24
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,093
You've got to lift up
that plastic thing with a pen.

25
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,626
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

26
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,095
Is it all right if I keep these here
for a while?

27
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,257
I'm having a New Year's Eve party.

28
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,426
You're gonna keep these here
for eight months?

29
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,700
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve, 1 999,
the millennium.

30
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,308
I told you about that.

31
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,605
Kramer, you're gonna leave these
chairs here for two and a half years?

32
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,346
You're not gonna see them.

33
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,042
I got a case of party poppers
I'm gonna keep in front of them.

34
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,247
Hey, so get this.

35
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,185
I got a call this morning
from the Mets' front-office guys.

36
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,882
-They want to take me out to lunch.
-What for?

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,996
I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry.
They probably want to pick my brain.

38
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,192
Really, why do you think
they're taking you out to lunch?

39
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,334
I have no idea.

40
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,530
All right, I have had it
with those Mayans.

41
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,072
I don't mind the Mayans.

42
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,508
You know that store, Putumayo?
I was trying to buy these huaraches...

43
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,648
...and this saleswoman
just completely ignored me.

44
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,306
Are we talking huaraches?

45
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,687
I know a great store for huaraches.

46
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,378
No, no, not Putumayo.

47
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,649
No, no, Cinco de Mayo.

48
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,690
Yeah, Marcelino,
he turned me onto it.

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,556
And he's 1/64 Mayan.

50
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,096
I'm starting to get a bit nervous
about this lunch.

51
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,097
What did you have?

52
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,203
Keep these here too, huh?
They'll be all right.

53
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,937
Kramer, these balloons aren't
gonna stay filled until New Year's.

54
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:04,214
Those aren't for New Year's.
Those are my everyday balloons.

55
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,446
George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need
somebody to head up scouting.

56
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,683
And we think that someone
might be you.

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,021
-Head of scouting?
-lnterested?

58
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,722
I'm still here.

59
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,564
Now, unfortunately, league rules
prevent us from making you an offer...

60
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,430
...while you're still under contract.

61
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,902
Do you understand
what we're talking about?

62
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,902
-So you're talking--?
-No, no.

63
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,270
We're not talking.

64
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:35,107
We're just talking.

65
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:40,118
-So you need me to get fired?
-We didn't say that.

66
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,277
We couldn't say that,
because even if we did--

67
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,083
-We couldn't say that we said it.
-See what we're saying?

68
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,959
But you are still paying
for this lunch?

69
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,856
We didn't say that.

70
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,026
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

71
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,966
There's a lot of chairs
and balloons in my apartment.

72
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,407
How about I make it up
to you with dinner?

73
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,100
Someplace nice this time?

74
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,008
Yeah, I'm sorry about
that Mongolian barbecue last night.

75
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,081
I had heard good things.

76
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,581
I don't know.

77
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,015
It got a two in Zagat's.

78
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,352
Let me just check my messages.

79
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,515
Maybe a nicer girl called.

80
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,191
-Hello.
-Hello?

81
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,763
-Who's this?
-Jane.

82
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,958
-What number did you dial?
-Seven.

83
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,271
Hey! See these?

84
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,943
Cinco de Mayo.

85
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,311
Sales commission, bye-bye-o.

86
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,023
-Good meeting?
-There was no meeting.

87
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,395
But it was quite a meeting.

88
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,696
You are looking at
the next director of Mets scouting.

89
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,840
The only thing is I have to get fired
from the Yankees first.

90
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,669
-You can do that.
-Of course.

91
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,438
But I really want to leave
my mark this time, you know?

92
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,105
I want to walk away
from the Yankees with people saying:

93
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:21,413
"Wow! Now, that guy got canned."

94
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,488
So you want to go out
in a final blaze of incompetence.

95
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,584
Remember at Dairy Queen
where I cooled my feet...

96
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,490
...in the soft-serve machine?

97
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,665
Do you think people will still be using
napkins in the year 2000?

98
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,236
Or is this mouth-vacuum thing
for real?

99
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,734
-So, George.
-Yeah.

100
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,703
I had, like, a so-so date with Valerie.

101
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,110
Now I'm number nine
on the speed dial.

102
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,444
-So?
-So I used to be seven.

103
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,915
I dropped two spots.

104
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,384
What? She's ranking you?

105
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,581
Yeah, the speed dial's like
a relationship barometer.

106
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,385
What is a barometer exactly?

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,256
It's pronounced "thermometer."

108
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,299
You know, in the year 2000,
we'll all be on speed dial.

109
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,997
You just think of a person,
they'll be talking to you.

110
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,337
It'll be like,
"I'm getting a call here.

111
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,436
Hey, it's Newman.

112
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,081
Hey, how you doing, Newman?

113
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,377
-I'm not here.
-Oh, you want to talk to Jerry?"

114
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,284
Flowers. You didn't have to do that.

115
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,762
I mean, the dinner and the play
and the hansom cab ride.

116
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:44,096
Well, I just wanted to-- You forgot
the gift certificate to Barnes & Noble.

117
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,067
--you know,
make a good impression.

118
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,470
-I'm gonna go put these in some water.
-I like the way you think.

119
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,079
Oh, my God, number one!

120
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,120
Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard.

121
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,922
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in
the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.

122
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,086
Isn't that Babe's Ruth uniform?

123
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,865
Is it?
Strawberries, anyone?

124
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,594
It's good.
Juicy this time of year.

125
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,171
Gotta get the good ones.

126
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,640
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.

127
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,604
So, Jerry, my millennium party's
really coming together.

128
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,512
Will people be able to breathe
under water in the year 2000?

129
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,547
Some of us.

130
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,614
I don't want to exclude anybody.

131
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,661
Shove it.

132
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,830
What is all this?

133
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,994
I got all of this junk
at Cinco de Mayo...

134
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,299
...because I was trying
to show Putumayo...

135
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,033
...how much business they'd lost.

136
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,075
I mean, I've been dancing
and strutting...

137
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,679
...in front of their store for two days.

138
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,681
Oh, no wonder
we're getting so much rain.

139
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,249
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party,
so save the date.

140
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,790
Hey, you know what? Newman sent
me an invitation already to his party.

141
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,256
-Newman?
-Yeah.

142
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,755
"Come celebrate the millennium
with 'Newmannium."'

143
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,529
Newman.

144
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,997
Hi, Valerie.

145
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,041
-You're not Valerie.
-I'm her stepmother.

146
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,939
Drive.

147
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,681
It's taken me 1 3 years to climb up
to the top of that speed dial...

148
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,685
...and I don't intend
to lose my spot to you.

149
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,052
-But I never--
-You just stay away from that phone.

150
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,859
You wanted to see me, sir?

151
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,258
I heard about what happened
at the meeting.

152
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,492
Yes. I already packed up my desk.
I could be out of here in an hour.

153
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,866
And I have to tell you it's exactly
what this organization needed.

154
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,407
To look to the future,
we've got to tear down the past.

155
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,205
Babe Ruth was nothing more
than a fat old man with little-girl legs.

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,042
And here's something
I just found out recently.

157
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,549
He wasn't really a sultan, huh?
What do you make of that?

158
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,250
Hey, check this out.

159
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,856
Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit.

160
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,926
You don't think that nerve disease
of his was contagious, do you?

161
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,585
Better take them off.
I'm too important to this team.

162
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,925
Big Stein can't be flopping
and twitching.

163
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,659
Hey, how about some lunch?
What are you going for?

164
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,072
You know, Valerie, I couldn't help
but notice that I'm on your speed dial.

165
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,836
You deserve it.

166
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,445
But I can't help thinking...

167
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,640
...that maybe there's someone
in your life who deserves it more.

168
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,810
Someone you've known,
you know, more than a week.

169
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,388
My stepmother got to you,
didn't she?

170
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,854
What? No.

171
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,118
I can't believe she did this again.

172
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:00,390
That's it.
She's off the speed dial completely.

173
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,336
Well, I just got your invitation
to the Newmannium party.

174
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,773
You just got it?
Damn, the mail is slow.

175
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,810
You knew I was having
a millennium party...

176
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,381
...but you just had to throw yours
on the same day.

177
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,450
I have done nothing unethical.

178
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,884
You have to cancel it, because
I've told everybody about my party.

179
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,991
Cancel? Think again, long shanks.

180
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,787
I started planning this in 1 978.

181
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,398
I put a deposit down on that restaurant
that overlooks Times Square.

182
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,626
And I booked Christopher Cross.

183
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,635
Well, what am I gonna do?
I've got over 200 folding chairs...

184
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,796
...and quite a bit of ice.

185
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,135
-What kind?
-Cubed.

186
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,039
That's good stuff.

187
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,703
And you can never have
too much ice.

188
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,872
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

189
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,316
You can cohost the party
with me under one condition.

190
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,389
No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.

191
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,491
I got to invite Jerry. He's my buddy.

192
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,221
That he may be, but he's out of my life
starting in the year 2000.

193
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:09,266
For me, the next millennium
must be Jerry-free.

194
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,635
How could they not fire you?

195
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,864
Never thought I'd fail at failing.

196
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,338
Oh, come on, now.

197
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,677
-Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
-Nonsense.

198
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,745
You do everything wrong.

199
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,541
-Everything?
-Everything.

200
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,877
-You really think so?
-Absolutely.

201
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,680
I have no confidence in you.

202
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,378
All right.

203
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,423
I guess I just have to pick myself up,
dust myself off...

204
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,423
...and throw myself
right back down again.

205
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,654
That's the spirit. You suck.

206
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,628
I know.

207
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,859
No, no, no, listen to me.
I work in fashion.

208
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,529
Together we can drive
Putumayo out of business...

209
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,236
...and make Cinco de Mayo,
numero uno de Mayo.

210
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,378
Do you need some help
with something?

211
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,944
You? What are you doing here?

212
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,086
I own this store.

213
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,750
No, you don't. You own Putumayo.

214
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,790
Unless you own both stores.

215
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,294
I'm Gladys Mayo.

216
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,236
This really sticks in my craw.

217
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:25,675
Well, Mrs. Hamilton, it's nice that you
and Valerie patched things up...

218
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,507
...so we could all
get together like this.

219
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,174
Where is Valerie?

220
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,817
I'm sure she'll be along.

221
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,748
Have some wine, Jerome.

222
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,353
Okay.

223
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:41,357
You know, Jerome, I can understand
what Valerie sees in you.

224
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:47,295
So attractive, so strong, so comedic.

225
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,593
Good.

226
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,037
Jerome, I have
a deliciously naughty idea.

227
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,006
What?

228
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,280
Why don't I put you
on my speed dial?

229
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,610
I don't know, Mrs. Hamilton.
That doesn't sound--

230
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,879
Don't be such a child, Jerome.

231
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,215
How's number three sound?

232
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,518
Valerie's not coming over, is she?

233
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,025
-Seven, four...
-No.

234
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,061
-...two.
-Stop. Stop. This isn't right.

235
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,893
-What about Valerie?
-I won't tell if you don't.

236
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,625
Oh, my--

237
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,972
Jerry.

238
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,838
Newman.

239
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,907
It's 2000.

240
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,105
Newmannium!

241
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,518
Oh, Jerry.

242
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,158
Yankees 2, Orioles nothing.
Wait a minute.

243
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,429
A short, stocky, bald man
is streaking across the field.

244
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,866
Oh, my God, George.

245
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,563
No, check that.
He's not streaking.

246
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,640
He's wearing
a flesh-toned body stocking.

247
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:08,109
Apparently he's a bit bashful,
and oddly, no one seems upset.

248
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,011
-It's George.
-Everyone loves him.

249
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,241
Yeah, I know.

250
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,751
Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come
to my New Year's party.

251
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,445
-All right.
-It's killing me.

252
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,423
Newman's got the jump on the invites
and will crush me if I try to go it alone.

253
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,061
-No problem.
-You're right.

254
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,924
I won't do it without you.

255
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,065
Oh, I feel so ashamed
I even thought of it.

256
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,031
Elaine, you can't go
to Newman's Newmannium.

257
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,137
-Okay.
-No, no, no, you've got to spend...

258
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,637
...New Year's 1 999
with me and Jerry.

259
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,140
-Fine.
-Oh, come on!

260
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,971
-All right.
-Yes, all right.

261
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,340
So it's you, it's me
and it's Jerry, huh?

262
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,813
Now things are starting to snowball.
I'll tell Newman I don't need him.

263
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,886
So I'll see you two
in the 21 st century.

264
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,453
Okay. Kramer, wait a minute.

265
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,557
-Do you still have that pricing gun?
-Yeah.

266
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,319
Okay. I need you to help me
put Putumayo out of business.

267
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,926
Can do.

268
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,724
What you doing
with a pricing gun?

269
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:05,603
That place is about to have the sale
of the century. Nothing over 99 cents.

270
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,830
Still a rip-off.

271
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,275
-Hello.
-I was just at my stepmom's house...

272
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,639
...and I saw that you were
on her speed dial.

273
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,647
Well, she probably just wanted
to be able to keep tabs on you.

274
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,409
Hold on a second.

275
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,486
-Hello.
-Hi, Jerome.

276
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,520
Oh, Mrs. Hamilton,
this is a very bad time.

277
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,023
I've got Valerie on the other line.
Just a second.

278
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,956
-Hello.
-That's her, isn't it?

279
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,120
-Well....
-I don't want you on her speed dial.

280
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,856
Hang on.

281
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,127
She knows about the speed dial.
You gotta get me off this thing.

282
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,136
I won't until she puts me
back on hers.

283
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,739
Hang on.

284
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,602
She wants to be back on yours.

285
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,711
-Fine. But only if you're off hers.
-Hang on.

286
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,312
Fine, if I'm off yours.

287
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,971
-No, still me.
-Sorry, hang on.

288
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,845
Fine, if I'm off yours.

289
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,476
I won't do it. It's my speed dial
and I don't trust her.

290
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,556
Please, Mrs. Hamilton,
this is very awkward for me.

291
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,124
All right.

292
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,659
I'll hide you in one
of the emergency buttons.

293
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,126
Great. Bye.

294
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,629
-She said she'll do it.
-Great.

295
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,165
Hang on.

296
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,065
-Hello.
-Jerry.

297
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,228
I can't get fired.

298
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,101
Hey, body-suit man, what's up?

299
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,438
-Hey, Body-Suit Man.
-Hey, look at that.

300
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,977
-Body-Suit man.
-Hey!

301
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,249
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker.

302
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,726
I'm a wealthy
American industrialist...

303
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,094
...Iooking to open a silver mine
in the mountains of Peru.

304
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,634
And before I invest millions
in a lucrative mine...

305
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,931
...I'd like to go a little native.

306
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,372
Get the feel of their condiments,
their unmentionables.

307
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:56,742
-You know, the real gritty-gritty.
-Well, let me show you what we have.

308
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,510
No, no, I think I can just
browse around on my own.

309
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,517
Machu Picchu.

310
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,021
-Are these free?
-Yeah.

311
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,196
Some of those are women's clothes.

312
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,634
Oh, not a problem.

313
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,216
Attention, Steinbrenner
and front-office morons.

314
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,878
Your triumphs mean nothing.

315
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,751
You all stink.

316
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:45,590
You can sit on it and rotate!

317
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,790
This is George Costanza.

318
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,400
I fear no reprisal.

319
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,066
Extension 51 70.

320
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,670
Come on.
What is taking you so long?

321
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,611
I broke the price gun,
so I had to move to plan B.

322
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,847
-Plan B?
-Yeah.

323
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,509
There is no plan B.

324
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,986
I took these out of every single
garment in the store.

325
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,148
-What?
-They're desiccants.

326
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,759
See, they absorb moisture.

327
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,261
These clothes won't last
five years without them.

328
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,931
-That's not gonna do anything.
-Patience.

329
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,071
-All right, forget it.
-What?

330
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,571
You have screwed me again,
Pennypacker.

331
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,839
Ladies, care for some chips?

332
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,208
Well, I don't mind if I do.

333
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,580
Well, I've changed my mind.

334
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:49,124
I think I'm going to build
a roller coaster instead.

335
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,575
I heard what you did
in the parking lot, big boy....

336
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,682
...and it is inexcusable.

337
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,816
Personally insulting me, my staff.

338
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,251
I cannot believe that you,
Body-Suit Man...

339
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,447
...could perpetrate
such a disloyal deed.

340
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,617
It breaks my heart to say it.
Who am I kidding? I love it. You're--

341
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,352
Wait! Wait, Mr. Steinbrenner.

342
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,259
George doesn't deserve
any blame...

343
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,831
...for what happened
in the parking lot today, sir.

344
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,936
-lf there's anyone to blame, it's me.
-What are you talking about?

345
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,629
-You popping pills? Got the crazies?
-No. No, sir.

346
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,367
I ordered George to drive around
insulting people today...

347
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,571
...because I'm tired
of all your macho head games.

348
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,741
He's lying, sir. I'm tired
of all your macho head games.

349
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,649
-Macho head games?
-He's just being loyal to me, sir.

350
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,345
Wilhelm, you're fired.

351
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,787
I owe you an apology,
Body-Suit Man. Streak on.

352
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,894
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm not going to the game today.

353
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,326
I'm going to go outside
and scalp some tickets.

354
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,695
Owner's box. That's gotta bring
in 40 bucks, no problem.

355
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,960
Mr. Wilhelm, what was that?

356
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,604
I wanted to get fired.

357
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:12,733
George, you are looking at the new
head scout of the New York Mets.

358
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,945
I don't know what Elaine
is so upset about.

359
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,318
Without desiccants, those clothes
will be noticeably musty in five years.

360
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,220
She never sees the big picture.

361
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,367
-Hello, Newman.
-Hello, Jerry.

362
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,333
What did you say to Elaine?

363
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,334
I just got her cancellation
in the mail.

364
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,736
Oh, well, I guess she found
someplace better to go.

365
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,937
Well, it's her mistake because she's
going to miss the party of a lifetime.

366
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,878
Well, maybe so,
but come midnight...

367
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,417
...when she's looking for someone
warm and cuddly to kiss...

368
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,489
...I guess you'll be caught between
the moon and New York City.

369
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,523
All right. Come back
to my party, please.

370
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,192
Jerry too, of course.

371
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,867
You don't want to do your act
or anything, do you?

372
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,837
-No.
-All right, then.

373
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,810
I guess I can accept a little Jerry
if it gets me a lot of Elaine.

374
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,374
-Deal?
-To the Newmannium.

375
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,450
To the "Kramennium."

376
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,321
By the way, Newman,
I'm just curious.

377
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,358
When you booked the hotel, did you
book it for the millennium New Year?

378
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,791
As a matter of fact, I did.

379
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,056
That's interesting
because as everyone knows...

380
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,756
...since there was no year zero...

381
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,460
...the millennium doesn't
begin until the year 2001...

382
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,970
...which would make your party
one year late...

383
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,633
...and thus quite lame.

384
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,886
I don't feel well at all.

385
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,224
I feel all dried-out inside.

386
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,228
-I'll call for help.
-Okay.

387
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,868
-Hello.
-Who's this?

388
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,270
-It's Jerry. Who's this?
-It's Valerie.

389
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,740
Oh, hi, Valerie, what's up?

390
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,607
I'll tell you what's up.
My stepmother is violently ill...

391
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,510
...so I hit the button for Poison Control
and I get you.

392
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,551
Wow, Poison Control.
That's even higher than number one.

393
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,952
Hello?
