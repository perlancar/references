1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,400
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,200
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while...

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,000
Years.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,600
When we were kids, they made it seem like 
it was right around the corner.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,000
I think Ed Begley Jr has one.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,900
No.
That's just electric.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,800
What about Harrison Ford?

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,200
He had one in the Blade Runner.
That was a cool one.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,900
What's the competition, 
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,300
What do you think the big holdup is?

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,900
The government is very touchy 
about us being in the air.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,500
Let us run around on the ground 
as much as we want.

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Anything in the air is a big production.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,900
Yeah, right.

And what about the floating cities?

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,400
And the underwater bubble cities?

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,400
It's like we're living in the '50s here.

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,500
It's good suspension!

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Would you stop it?

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,600
You'll have plenty of time to destroy it 
after I get it.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car.

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,300
What is wrong with you?

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,200
You never tell 'em you like the car.

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,900
You're not sure what you want.

You don't even know why you're here.

24
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,100
That vein again.

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,100
I'm starving.
We should have had lunch first...

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,200
It'll be twenty minutes.
I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,500
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars?
I thought he was a mechanic.

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,900
I guess he graduated.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,700
That's an easy move.

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Go from screwing you behind your back 
to screwing you right to your face.

31
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,800
Thank you.

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,500
Puddy's just gonna give you the car, huh?

33
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,300
Youll see.

34
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,200
First they stick you with the undercoating, 
rust-proofing, dealer prep.

35
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Suddenly you're on your back like a turnip.

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,300
Alright.
Calm down.

37
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
My father had a car salesman buddy.
He was gonna fix him up real nice.

38
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,000
Next thing I know, I'm getting dropped off 
in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,700
All the kids are shoutin at me:

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,900
"Hey, Le George!
Bonjour, Le George!

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,600
"Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,700
Jerry, I don't think 
this thing is hooked up right.

43
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,500
Alright, were goin in.

44
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,600
You've got a good eye, there.

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,300
I see you've noticed 
the uni-body construction.

46
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,700
I'm Rick.
Are you looking to buy or lease?

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,800
Uh, borrow.

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,100
It's for my friend.
Yeah, hell be buying...

49
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,700
Maybe I should talk to him.

50
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,100
Oh, I don't think so.

51
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
No, he's an entertainer.

52
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,800
You know, all over the place.

53
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
That's where I come in.

54
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I see. So, youre his manag-
- Yeah, neighbor. That's right.

55
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Why don't we take this boiler out 
for a shakedown?

56
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,900
Look at these salesmen.

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,500
The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out.

58
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,200
No matter what they say, 
you say, "I'll walk out of here right now!"

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,100
Can I help you with something?

60
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Hold it!
One more step and were walking!

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,500
George.

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,200
Sorry, we're just waiting for David Puddy.

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>He</i> is.
You don't know what <i>I'm</i> doing here.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,700
Hey.

65
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,400
Hey.

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,100
Sorry I'm late.

67
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,100
My new salesman boyfriend took me out 
to celebrate his promotion.

68
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,400
Ah.
Where'd you go?

69
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Uh, to a restaurant.
- Arby's.

70
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
I had the roast beef...

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,300
So, Puddy, I decided 
I'm gonna go with another 900 convertible.

72
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,800
Alright.
Classic.

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,600
High-five.

74
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
David, can you tell me 
where the Xerox machine is?

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Oh, sure, babe.

76
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,600
Salesman-only copy room right there.

77
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh.

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,700
Hey, come on, guys.
Ill show you the 900.

79
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Yeah, you show us the 900.

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,100
And look at these features, Mr Kramer: 

81
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Anti-lock breaks, 
automatic climate control.

82
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,800
Uh, make a right at this corner, please.

83
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,700
An adjustable steering wheel and...

84
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,500
Oh, Mr.
Kramer, you missed the turn...

85
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,700
No.
No, I didn't.

86
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Well, that's okay.

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,900
We'll make this next right 
and swing around to get back to the dealership.

88
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,500
Well, it's a test drive, right?

89
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,800
I never drive around here.

90
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,400
If I'm gonna recommend this car, 
I need to see that it'll handle my daily routine.

91
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
So where are we going?

92
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Just a little place 
I like to call "You'll see".

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm starving. You got any of those 
free donuts you use to soften people up?

94
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,400
By the service department.

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,500
Alright, remember: 
no rust-proofing.

96
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,400
Commit to nothing.

97
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,600
If you have to speak - mumble.

98
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
Au revoir, Le George.

99
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,400
Don't think it can't happen!

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
So, Puddy, 
this is a pretty good move for you, huh?

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,300
No more grease monkey.

102
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,300
I don't care for that term.

103
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Oh.
Sorry, I didn't know...

104
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,000
No, I don't know too many monkeys 
who could take apart a fuel injector.

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,600
I saw one once that could do sign language.

106
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,900
Yeah, I saw that one.
Uh...

107
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,500
Koko.

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,900
Yeah, Koko.

109
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,300
Right, Koko.

110
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,300
That chimp's alright.
High-five.

111
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,200
Hey, hey, hey!
What's goin on here?

112
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,400
You didn't agree to anything, did ya?

113
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,900
No.
We both just saw the same monkey.

114
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,800
Well, I got screwed on the donuts.
There were none left.

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Well, there's a vending machine.
I can show you where it is.

116
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
Hey, gimme a dollar.

117
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Where's your money?

118
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,700
I'm here helpin' you.

119
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,200
Hey. Where's Puddy?
The copy machine is broken.

120
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,400
He-he-heh.
That's what they want you to think.

121
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,900
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend 
has developed an annoying little habit?

122
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,000
The squinting?

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,800
No.

124
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
The staring?

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,100
No.

126
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,900
He keeps asking me 
to give him a high-five.

127
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,200
I thought all guys do that.

128
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Slapping hands is the lowest form 
of male primate ritual.

129
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,500
In fact, even some of <i>them</i> have moved on. 
They're doing sign language now.

130
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,600
It's that bad?

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,700
What do you think the Nazis were doing?

132
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,700
That was the heil-five.

133
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,400
Isn't that from your act, 
like ten years ago?

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
It was a good bit in the 80s, 
and it's still relatable today.

135
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,400
Good news.
We got a 900 in black.

136
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,200
That's the hot color.
High-five.

137
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Um, David, you know what?
Can you come help me fix the copy machine?

138
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,200
You owe me five.

139
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,900
Twix...

140
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,900
B-5.

141
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Ah, come on!

142
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,800
Ah, excuse me.
Do you have change of a dollar?

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,500
No.

144
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Could I trade you for another dollar?

145
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,600
Don't have one.

146
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,900
Excuse me.

147
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,700
When your wallet was open, 
I glanced inside, 

148
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
and I couldn't help but notice 
that you had several crisp dollar bills.

149
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,500
You're incorrect.

150
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,800
Perhaps you could look again, please?
I'm very hungry.

151
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
We had donuts earlier.

152
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
I guess everyone here 
enjoys giving the old scroogie, huh?

153
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,100
Youre all doing a hell of a job!

154
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,800
What I would do with you...

155
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Mr Kramer, we're really not allowed 
to use the cars to run errands.

156
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
No, look, Rick.

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm very close to giving this car, that my 
celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement.

158
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's see if I can get a smile from these femininas...

159
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
Hey ladies!

160
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,800
It's a Saab 900!
What do you think?

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Can I interest you in a little 
supplemental restraint?

162
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Geez!

163
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,500
I think the candy comes out over there.

164
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,500
People drop change down here, Jerry.
And they're too lazy to pick it up.

165
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,900
Either that, or they've got a weird little hang-up 
about lying face-down in filth.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Why don't you just go to the cashier?

167
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,300
The cashier is at lunch -
which is where I'd like to be.

168
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
How much was under there?

169
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,000
I think something bit me.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,400
I just need another nickel.

171
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player.
What do you think?

172
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,400
He's got a live one.
Hes just reeling his big fish in!

173
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,700
Hey, can I have my dollar back?

174
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,700
It's wrinkled.
It's worthless.

175
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,900
Come on!

176
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Jump!

177
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,400
They just put out some more donuts.

178
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,500
They did?

179
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Last one.

180
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Well, just one more errand
and we can head back.

181
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
Actually, it looks like 
we're gonna need some gas.

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,100
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think 
is in there right now?

183
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,700
Well, its on "E".

184
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,700
You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - 
he lend me his car,

185
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,700
and I find myself in a situation 
where the car is almost out of gas.

186
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
But, for a variety of reasons, 

187
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,900
I don't want to be the one responsible 
for purchasing costly gasoline.

188
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
So, you want to know how far 
you can drive your friend's car for free.

189
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,700
Well, I make it up to him in other ways.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for 
and yet remains dangling in the machine.

191
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
Hey, it's gone.

192
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Where is my Twix?

193
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,300
What?
That guy's eating it!

194
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Well, how do you know that one's yours?

195
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
It was dangling!

196
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,800
There were only two left in the machine!
He must've bought one, and gotten both.

197
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,900
Sir, are you gonna buy a car?

198
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,600
No!

199
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Hey!
Hey!
I can see you!
That is my Twix!

200
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Paper jam...

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
Got it!

- Hey!

202
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,300

203
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,700
On the flip side.

204
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,300
David, um, I...

205
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,100
Don't leave me hanging.

206
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,200
You're a salesman now - 
and the high-five is...

207
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,800
It's very grease monkey.

208
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,900
What did I tell you about that?

209
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm sorry, but 
the high-five is just so stupid.

210
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,600
Oh yeah?
I'll tell you what's stupid.

211
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,000
You, stupid.

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,700
Well, that is really mature.

213
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,400
Yeah?
So are you.

214
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,000
You're the grease monkey.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,900
That doesn't make any sense.

216
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,100
I am leaving.

217
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Yeah, if you leave, we're through.

218
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,500
Fine!
We're through!

219
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, so you're leaving?

220
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,500
That's right.

221
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,400
High-five!

222
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,000
On the flip side!

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Taking me to Arby's...

224
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,100
Hey!
Wh-where are you...?

225
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Lets finish this up.

226
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Did you two break up?

227
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,500
That chick's whacked.

228
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,000
We're history.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,700
I just left out a couple of things: 
rust-proofing...

230
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,800
"Rust-proofing"?

231
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Transport charge, storage surcharge, 
additional overcharge, 

232
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
finder's fee...

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,700
"Finder's fee"?
It was on the lot!

234
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,600
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Floor mats, keys...

236
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,100
"Keys"?

237
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,100
How are you gonna start it?

238
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
Excuse me.

239
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,400
I believe you just ate my Twix bar.

240
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,500
It was dangling.

241
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,000
And when you purchased your Twix bar, 
you got a little freebie, 

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,900
and you never bothered to ask why,
or seek out its rightful owner.

243
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,900
First of all, it wasn't a Twix.
It was a 5th Avenue bar.

244
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,100
You must think I'm pretty stupid.
That was no 5th Avenue bar.

245
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,500
I can see the crumb 
right there in the corner of your lip!

246
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
That is a cookie!

247
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,400
And we all know that Twix is 
the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.

248
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,100
That's a little nougat.

249
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
Nougat?
Please.

250
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,600
I think I've reached the point in my life 
where I can tell between nougat and cookie.

251
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
So, let's not just say things 
that we both know are obvious fabrications.

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,500
You know, you're getting a little vein there...

253
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,600
I know about the vein!

254
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,300
I can't believe this guy...

255
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,100
Hey, George!

256
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm starving!

257
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,000
No, last one.
Listen, you gotta help me out.

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
Elaine and Puddy just broke up.
He treats me just like a regular customer now!

259
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen.
No-ho-ho!

260
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
You were gonna get a deal, huh?

261
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,500
There's no laws in this place.
Anything goes!

262
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,700
It's Thunderdome!

263
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,900
Is someone helping you?

264
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,100
Stay back!

265
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Where is it now?

266
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,300
There's still some overlap 
between the needle and the slash below the "E".

267
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,600
How long are you gonna go?

268
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,500
Oh, I've been in the slash many times.

269
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,400
This is nothing.
You'll get used to it.

270
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,600
Just put it out of your mind.

271
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Have you ever been completely below the slash?

272
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,700
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out.

273
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,400
When I came to, 
the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full.

274
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,500
I don't know who did it, 
and I never got to thank them...

275
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,900
Mr Kramer, the road!

276
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,000
So, listen, Puddy.

277
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
When we first started this deal, 
I thought things were gonna be different.

278
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Now, if you want to play hardball, I got my friend 
George here, and he can play pretty hard... ball.

279
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,900
George, vein it up.

280
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,700
Alright, Puddy, listen, and listen good: 

281
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,200
I need to know the name of that mechanic 
that walks around here.

282
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Big guy, a liar.
Short name.

283
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,000
Sam? Moe? Sol?

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,200
George!
Can we focus on the car here?

285
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm starving!
I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.

286
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Jerry, I just need your signature here, 
and we'll get you that yellow car ready to go.

287
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,400
Yellow?
I wanted black.

288
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't give you black at that price.

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,700
George, would you help me, please?

290
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,300
Yes.
This is wrong!

291
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,500
Sing it, sister!

292
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Just because a candy bar 
fails to fall from its perch,

293
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,200
does not imply transfer of ownership.

294
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,400
Moe, Sol, or... Lem 
is not gonna get away with this!

295
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I'll be right back.

296
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,300
Okay.

297
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,900
Hey, George!

298
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,300
Is it just the angle I'm looking from?

299
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
No, Sir.
We are down there.

300
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Oh, this is amazing!
Oh, I've never felt so alive!

301
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,500
Alright.
I'm satisfied.
We better get some gas.

302
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,800
What?
Well, we can't stop now.

303
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
What do you mean?

304
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,300
We have to keep going. All the way back 
to the dealership. That was the plan.

305
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,100
There was no plan.

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,700
Well, let's make it the plan!
Lets just go for it!

307
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,800
Like Thelma and Louise.

308
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
What, they drove to a dealership?

309
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
No, they drove off a cliff.

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
You are one sick mama...

311
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,100
I like it.

312
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Mr.
Kramer, the road!

313
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Hello?

314
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,000
Elaine, you've got to get 
back down to the dealer.

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Puddy is screwing me on this car, 
which is yellow now!

316
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Who is this?

317
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,200
Elaine!

318
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,500
What?

319
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,400
You gotta get back together with Puddy 
so I can make this deal.

320
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,400
You know, just that you cared enough to call 
means so much, Jerry.

321
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,900
You've gotta get back together.
Anyway, it's thousands of dollars!

322
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Oh, I don't know...

323
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,800
Come on. Then you don't have to see him again 
till my 15,000-mile check.

324
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?

325
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,300
Fine.

326
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,000
And I didn't like that roast beef, 
so how about some lunch?

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
No.
No lunch.

328
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,900
I'll hang the phone up right now!
- Alright! Lunch!

329
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll see ya.
- Bye.

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,600
Everybody's ripping me off!

331
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
I'd like to report a problem 
with one of your mechanics.

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
When did you bring the car in?

333
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,700
Yeah, right.

334
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I'm gonna get my car repaired at a dealership!
Why don't I just flush my money down the toilet?

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Sir, what exactly is the problem?

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - 
stole my Twix candy bar!

337
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Are you saying 
he grabbed the candy bar away from you?

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,100
He might as well have!

339
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,100
I caught him, and his face 
was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.

340
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,200
I thought you said it was a Twix.

341
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,100
Oh, it was.
But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.

342
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,800
Maybe it was.

343
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,500
Oh, no. No.
Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.

344
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,000
What about the $100,000 bar?

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
No.
Rice and caramel.

346
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,000
Nougat?
- No.

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,700
Positive?
- Please.

348
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,700
You know they changed the name 
from "$100,000 Bar" to "100 Grand"?

349
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,600
All I want is my 75 cents back, 
an apology, and for him to be fired!

350
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I remember when you used to be able 
to get a Hershey for a nickel.

351
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,300
What's the one with the 
swirling chocolate in the commercial?

352
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,700
They all have 
swirling chocolate in the commercial!

353
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,800
Not Skittles.

354
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,300
Dad, I told you you could sit here 
only if you don't talk.

355
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,100
You make your father sit here all day?

356
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,800
He likes it!

357
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Alright!
Do you mind?
I have the window!

358
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,500
Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?

359
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,600
Twix has too much coconut.

360
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,900
No!
There's no coconut!

361
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm allergic to coconut.

362
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,100
I'm not.

363
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,800
A nickel!

364
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,300
Cab receipt.
Hey, Puddy.

365
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,700
I'm with a customer.

366
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,400
No, no.
No, Elaine, the car can wait.

367
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,200
What's important is 
you two getting back together.

368
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,500
Then we'll talk about the car.

369
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I don't want to get back with her.
She's too bossy.

370
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,700
David...

371
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,900
Okay.

372
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Now, I know this is an important decision.
Why don't we all just sit down and talk about it?

373
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Come on, come on.

374
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Now, look.
You both find each other attractive, right?

375
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,900
Right.

376
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Clearly, no one else can stand to be 
with either one of you...

377
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,800
I guess.
- Good point.

378
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,500
Alright.

379
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Now, what do I have to do 
to put you two in a relationship today?

380
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,100
Cars can go on empty, 
but not us humans, huh, fella?

381
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,500
I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.

382
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,700
No, no coconut for me.

383
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,400
Alright, I'll get ya a Mounds bar.

384
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Keep the engine running.

385
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,700
No, man!
Not the gas!

386
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,000
But it needs it, Kramer!
It needs it bad!

387
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,700
Do you think that this'll make you happy?
Cause it won't!

388
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,200
Ah, you can just go on without me.

389
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,300
Listen to me.

390
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,700
When that car rolls into that dealership 
and that tank is bone dry, 

391
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,200
I want you to be there with me 
when everyone says: "Kramer and that other guy, 

392
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
oh, they went further to the left 
of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"

393
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,500
Maybe we better get moving.

394
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,300
It's good to have you back, Stan.

395
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,600
It's Rick, by the way.

396
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,000
No time!

397
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,100
Mr.
Costanza, I really don't have time for this.

398
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Now, if this mechanic guy was in fact 
eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claimed, 

399
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,900
wouldn't you agree he would have no problem 
picking one out from a candy line-up?

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
"Candy line-up"?

401
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,700
I've spent the last hour 
preparing ten candy bars,

402
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,700
with no wrappers of identification 
of any kind, for him to select from.

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
It took you an hour?

404
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Only I hold the answer key 
to their true candy identities.

405
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,800
And so, without further ado, I give you...

406
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,500
the candy line-up.

407
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,400
Hey, Willie, check it out!
Free candy!

408
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
That's my candy line-up!
Where are all my cards?

409
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,500
They're all on the floor!

410
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
How many Twix does that make for you today?
Like, 8 Twix?!

411
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,200
No.

412
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,900
Hey, this Clark bar is good.

413
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,000
Its a Twix!

414
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,500
They're all Twix!
It was a setup!

415
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
A setup, I tell ya!
And you've robbed it!

416
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,900
You've all screwed me again!

417
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,700
Now, gimme one!
Gimme a Twix!

418
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,000
They're all gone.

419
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Twix!

420
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,800
What was that?

421
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,400
There's a mental hospital right near here.

422
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Alright.
Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: 

423
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,300
Arby's - no more than once a month.

424
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,300
In exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game
and doesn't read a book.

425
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,900
That's not bad.
- I can live with that.

426
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,700
So, you're back together?

427
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,600
Yeah.

428
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,100
Alright, alright.
Alright, that's enough!

429
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,600
Let's get back to my deal.

430
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,500
That undercoating -
that's a rip-off, isn't it, David?

431
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, we don't even know what it is.

432
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,300
So, I'm getting the insiders' deal?

433
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,400
Insiders' deal.

434
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
High-five.

435
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,500
There's the dealer!

436
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,800
Hey!

437
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,200
We did it!
We pulled it off!

438
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,100
I can't believe it!
Where's the needle?

439
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,500
Oh, it broke off, baby!
Woo, hoo, hoo!

440
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,900
Oh, Mr Kramer, I gotta thank you.

441
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,000
I learned a lot.
Things are gonna be different for me now.

442
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,900
Well, that's a weird thing to say.

443
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,700
I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.

444
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Yeah, yeah.
I wonder.

445
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,900
This is nice.
What kind of car is this?

446
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,800
Caprice Classic.

447
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
You couldn't just give him one high-five?

448
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's like the wave at ball games.
Air quotes.
The phrase "Don't go there."

449
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,100
Someone's gotta take a stand!

450
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,900
This Arby's is good.

451
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,400
So, George, I still don't understand - 
how was that a setup?

452
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,100
And who were you trying to set up, anyway?
The mechanic or the manager?

453
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,200
I don't know.

454
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,000
All of them.
Theyre all crooks!

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Besides, I couldn't get 
all different candy bars anyway.

456
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,300
What was that?

457
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,800
I think there's a mental hospital near here.

458
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Very near.

459
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, I think we stopped.

460
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
You can probably let go of my hand now.

461
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Oh, yeah.

462
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Well, I'll think about it...

463
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Do you have my card?
