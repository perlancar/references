1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,200
Maura, I want you to know--

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,200
I-I've given this a lot of thought. 

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
I'm sorry, but we--

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,400
We have to break up.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
No.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,300
What's that?

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,300
We're not breaking up.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
We're not?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
All right.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,200
She said no?

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
She said no.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,200
What did you do?

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
What could I do? 

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,300
We fooled around and went to a movie.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,200
George, both parties don't have to consent 
to a breakup. 

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,200
It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine 
and you both have to turn your keys. 

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. 

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,400
Let me hear your arguments.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,600
Well, I don't really like her.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,700
That's good.

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
I don't find her attractive.

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,800
Solid.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,400
I'd like to sleep with a lot of other women.

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,800
Always popular.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,700
Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food. 

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,700
"Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are so good."

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,100
You have an airtight case.

29
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,900
And in bed--

30
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,900
I'm afraid we're out of time.

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey.
- What?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Check these out. 

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,800
These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks 
that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". 

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,300
I got 'em at an auction.

35
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,500
I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this 
Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. 

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,200
Now I have an in 
to strike up a conversation with him.

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,200
You already have an in. 
You have the same first name. 

39
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,000
Jerry!

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh, that'll intrigue him.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Well, it worked when I met 
George Peppard last week.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,300
George Peppard has been dead for years.

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,300
Well, whoever he was, 
he knew a lot about The A-Team.

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,800
So you would choose your last meal 
based on the method of execution?

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,300
Right, right. 

46
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,600
I mean, if I was getting the chair, 
I'd go for something hot and spicy. 

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,300
You know, Thai, maybe Mexican. 

48
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,000
Lethal injection - 
feels like pasta. 

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You know, painless, 
don't want anything to heavy.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,300
So, um, why don't we get together some time?

51
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,800
Oh, sure. Why don't you give me your number?

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
I think it'd be better if I called you.

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
Oh. OK. 

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. 

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Do-do you work around here?

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,200
No, not really.

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,100
So, is there anything 
you can tell me about yourself?

58
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,500
I think you're very beautiful.

59
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Oh? That'll do.

60
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,800
What about Puddy?

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,100
I haven't talked to him in 
like three weeks. 

62
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,800
I think it might be over.

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
So, what's this guy about?

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
I don't know. 

65
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,200
He wouldn't tell me his phone number
where he worked.

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,900
I'll bet he's in a relationship.

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Or he's a crime fighter 
safeguarding his secret identity. 

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,100
Elaine, you could be dating 
the Green Lantern!

69
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,000
Which one is he?

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Green suit, power ring.

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,900
I don't care for jewely on men.

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,600
Hey. It happened again. 

73
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,300
Another robbery in the building.

74
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,000
So you bought a cooler?

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,300
No, it's a strongbox 
to protect my irreplacables.

76
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,500
And... what would those be?

77
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Some taxidermy 
that's been in my family for generations. 

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,600
My Tony,

79
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,300
my... military discharge.

80
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,400
You were in the Army?

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,300
Briefly. 

82
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,800
Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. 

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Because if somebody finds this, 
they hold the key to all my possessions.

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Literally.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
"Literally"? 
What's that supposed to mean? 

86
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,400
You mind if I hide this somewhere?

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
No, go ahead.

88
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,000
A little... privacy, huh?

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
Oh, come on!

90
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,300
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue. 

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,000
Boy, you wouldn't last a day in the Army.

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
How long did you last?

93
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Well, that's classified.

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,500
Hey, what if he's married?

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,600
Kramer?

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
No, the Green Lantern.

97
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,700
OK!

98
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,200
So, you would date a married guy?

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
That's so hacky.

100
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. 

101
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
This might be the closest I get.

102
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,200
You peeked!

103
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,800
This is your hiding place?!

104
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
It was under a spoon!

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,400
And so, for all these reasons, 
we are officially broken up. 

106
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Thank you--

107
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
and good night.

108
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
No, George, we're not.

109
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,200
But I proved it!

110
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
I refuse to give up on this relationship. 

111
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,000
It's like launching missiles from a submarine. 

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Both of use have to turn our keys.

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Well, then, I am gonna have to 
ask you to turn your key.

114
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm sorry, George, 
I can't do that.

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Turn your key, Maura. 
Turn your key!

116
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,800
So, how is a guy like you not involved?

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,900
I might ask you the same thing.

118
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,700
<i>That's true, maybe he's not married.</i>

119
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Oh, that is so sweet.

120
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
<i>How long do I have to hold this?</i>

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,300
Oh, no.

122
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,100
Who is it?

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Uh, no one, no one. 

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,600
Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on.

125
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
<i>Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower.</i>

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,400
Jerry! Jerry!

127
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,700
Elaine, what are you doin' down there?

128
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,100
You didn't hear me buzzing?

129
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Oh, I guess it's broken.

130
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,000
Throw down your key.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,300
It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.

132
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,800
I'll catch it!

133
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
You'll chicken out at the last second.

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeah, you're right.

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,500
Well, will you at least keep me company 
until somebody comes out?

136
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,500
All right.

137
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,600
Hey, you know what's weird?

138
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Huh?

139
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,700
I used to be able to have a huge meal, 
go right to sleep. 

140
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
But I can't anymore.

141
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Nodding off!

142
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,300
Well, I was right. 

143
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,300
He's an adulterer. 

144
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,300
And he's cheating on his wife with me.

145
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,300
We haven't done anything yet.

146
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?

147
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,200
All right. Here!

148
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.

149
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,200
It went in the sewer!

150
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Hey...
- What are you doin'?

151
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,000
You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,300
You just had to go lookin' for it, 
didn't you? 

153
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
See, you hate it that I have a little secret. 

154
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,800
Anything I do-- 

155
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
you gotta know all about it!

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,700
You're so obsessed with me.

157
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm gonna go let Elaine in.

158
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,900
What are you doing with her?

159
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,100
Kramer!

160
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,200
Security issue!

161
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Oh, hey. You got in.

162
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. 
Here.

163
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Oh, thanks.

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,400
That wasn't me!

165
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
So, he's definitely married, huh?

166
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Boy, I would've loved to have been there 
when you told him off.

167
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,500
Oh, come on!

168
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Well, he could be a superhero! 
You should've seen him run.

169
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,400
OK!

170
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,900
All right, Jerry. 

171
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,300
Let's see if you can get it in your head

172
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,300
that this is not an Easter egg hunt 
for your childish amusement.

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jerry!

174
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,200
George, the buzzer's broken! 
I'll come down!

175
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,300
I believe this belongs to you.

176
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Where did you get that?

177
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,900
I bought it.

178
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Thanks.

179
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,700
What?

181
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,400
There's been some robberies in the building. 
I-I can't let you in.

182
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,100
But, I live here. 

183
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,400
I ran out to buy some birdseed, 
and I forgot my key.

184
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Sounds like a scam.

185
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Very sorry.

186
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,100
So, I broke up with Maura. 
It's done. I'm out.

187
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,900
Great, you're lonely and miserable again.

188
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,500
Feels right.

189
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,700
Is that guy still there?

190
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,200
He's starin' at us.

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Don't look at him.

192
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,600
We don't hear that.

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Want a bite?

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,600
No, I don't.

195
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop 
is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. </i>

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,800
<i>How can I prove it? </i>

197
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
<i>Can't. Damn it.</i>

198
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,200
Hey, honey.

199
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,300
What? 

200
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,700
Maura, what are you doing here? 

201
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,500
I ended this relationship, twice.

202
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
George, you didn't mean that. 
That was just a fight.

203
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Why does it always seem like 
I'm the only one working at this breakup?

204
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,600
George, I listened to your arguments, 
and they were rambling and flimsy. 

205
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm not convinced. 

206
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner.

207
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,200
All right.

208
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Eww, Mr. Apple! 
You have a brown spot!

209
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,900
So, this is your little... love nest?

210
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,900
It's nothing special, 
just a little place I keep.

211
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,300
Shall I light a fire?

212
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,900
Oh, that sounds romantic.

213
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm having a little problem with the heat. 

214
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,700
I got some cardboard out here.

215
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,700
This is wrong. I should go.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,300
Can you get that, please?

217
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Oh, sure.

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,500
Where's Glenn?

219
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,700
You're the woman from the street, 
and I am so sorry. 

220
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,500
You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. 

221
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I-I thought he was a superhero. 
I swear.

222
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Lady, I'm not his wife, 
I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?

223
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,000
This is his home?

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,900
Yes.

225
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,000
So, he's...

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Poor.

227
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I think this will burn!

228
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,400
So you do live here.

229
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Yeah.

230
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,400
You live on this floor?

231
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Yeah.

232
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,900
So you live right... there.

233
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Yeah.

234
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,900
So I guess I'll see--

235
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,600
He wouldn't give me his number 
because he doesn't have a phone. 

236
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,800
He's not married. 

237
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,300
He's poor.

238
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,900
Is he wretchedly poor? 

239
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Does he wear one of those barrels, 
with the straps?

240
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
He probably busted it up 
and burned it for heat.

241
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,500
So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie 
his walking papers?

242
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,200
How can I end it over money? 
I feel bad.

243
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,700
Well, let's think. 

244
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,200
Have you ever dealt with the poor 
in any other situation?

245
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Yes. 

246
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,400
There was this homeless guy 
who used to urinate on our garbage cans.

247
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
Good. How did you handle that?

248
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,500
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... 

249
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,300
Now he goes in the alley across the street.

250
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,800
Same situation. 
Pay him off, and you're clean.

251
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Well, I am not paying Glenn off 
to get out of this relationship.

252
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,000
What am I supposed to do? 

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Just walk into his hovel, and hand him... 

254
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,700
Well, how much do you think it would be?

255
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,500
Hey.

256
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Hey, where have you been?

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,700
Seeing Maura. 

258
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Apparently, I was unable to break up 
beyond a reasonable doubt.

259
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
If only he could have been 
cheating on his wife, you know.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,100
Things would have been so much simpler.

261
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,300
Who's this, Blue Arrow?

262
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,500
Green Lantern.

263
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,800
We found out 
his super power was lack of money.

264
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
All right.

265
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
He's invulnerable to creditors.

266
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,900
We get it.

267
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,500
He's the 'Got-no-Green' Lantern.

268
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Thank you.

269
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,900
Hey, Elaine. 
Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.

270
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,500
Well crafted.

271
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,800
Hey, maybe this cheating thing 
is what I could use to ditch Maura.

272
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,100
She's like a District Attorney.

274
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,200
If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross.

275
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,600
I actually have to do it.

276
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Could you move over there?

277
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,700
Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work 
that always had a crush on me.

278
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,100
Really? 
How come you never pursued her before?

279
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,900
She's too tan. 

280
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,300
It's the middle of the winter, 
she's like a carrot.

281
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,600
Did I leave my glasses here?

282
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,300
He can wipe out his checking account 
in a single bound!

283
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Keep 'em!

284
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,500
Hey.

285
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,400
There's a giant parrot in the hallway.

286
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
It's Phil's.

287
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,100
Who?

288
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,700
Our neighbor that you turned against. 

289
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to 
let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.

290
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
What'd ya tell him that for?

291
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Because since you've been 
playing God with the front door, 

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,400
I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. 

293
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.

294
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,600
Really? What's it like? 

295
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,700
Is it nicer than mine? 
Where does he have the couch?

296
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,100
Well, I don't know, 
but the key problem is solved. 

297
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,200
I hid it at Phil's.

298
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,900
He let you?

299
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
No, he doesn't know. 

300
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,100
See, I hid it without telling him.

301
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,100
So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively 
looking for it like some people. 

302
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
You!

303
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,100
So, you... you say 
you've been in the city all winter?

304
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,100
I was in Maine for a couple days.

305
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Well... here we are.

306
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,800
George, I've always fantasized 
about jumping into bed with you.

307
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
But... I don't want to spoil things 
by sleeping with you too soon.

308
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Are you sure? 
'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.

309
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
I want to build something with you, George.

310
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,800
Oh, not more building.

311
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
And I won't take no for an answer.

312
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,500
No?

313
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,500
No.

314
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,500
All right.

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,200
What are we doing in this alley, anyway?

316
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
It's a surprise.

317
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,100
What are you doing? What is that?

318
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,600
It's a bag of donuts.

319
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
It's garbage.

320
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,200
No, no, no. 

321
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,100
When they make the new ones, 
the old ones come out right here.

322
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,000
All right, that's it. 

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,700
How do you spell your last name?

324
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,900
It's a bear claw! 
You have no idea how rare this is.

325
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,200
I'll make it out to cash. 

326
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,000
How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Make it three hundred.

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
You know, Elaine--

329
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,800
You are the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life.

330
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Aw, Glenn.

331
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,100
Hi. Is Phil here?

332
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,500
Yeah, I'm here.

333
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,200
Phil... hi. 

334
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I-I know we kind of got off to a bad start. 

335
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,200
But your bird-- which is lovely, by the way-- 
made a mess on my door.

336
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,100
And?

337
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,000
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, 
or your maid, there.

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's my wife.

339
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
All right, I think we're done here.

340
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,600
So, you're in a relationship 
with a woman you don't like, 

341
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,400
and you're having an affair 
with a woman that won't have sex with you.

342
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
This isn't going well.

343
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,200
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. 

344
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
Without 'em, I have no in!

345
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,700
You don't need the cufflinks. 
You have the same name. 

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Jerry!

347
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
Where are you going? 
Help me look.

348
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,700
It's a big night. 

349
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,600
I'm ice skating with one, 

350
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,600
and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" 
with the other.

351
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,300
Which is with who?

352
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,800
It doesn't matter.

353
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,200
Whoo! Boy. 
Yeah, you clean up nice.

354
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,300
I can't go until I find my cufflinks.

355
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. 

356
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer 
and put 'em in my strongbox.

357
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,400
You're a lifesaver. 
Would you get them, please?

358
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, 
we'll pick up the key.

359
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,400
Hey, what's going on?

360
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
Fredo is dead.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,300
That strange Portuguese guy 
that lives next-door to the incinerator?

362
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,200
No, my bird! 
We just got back from the pet cemetery.

363
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Oh, Phil. Mrs. Phil.

364
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm so sorry.

365
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,500
Oh, I'll bet you are! 

366
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
They told us he was poisoned! 
Something in his food.

367
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,100
But I, I didn't--

368
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,200
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! 

369
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,800
And who buries a bird?

370
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, 
and he puts it in the incinerator.

371
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,600
Just get the key and let's get out here.

372
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,700
You know, it's a funny thing 
about that bird dying. 

373
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,700
I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. 
Whew! That's a weird coincidence.

374
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,500
You killed Fredo!

375
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,100
Fredo was weak and stupid. 
He shouldn't've eaten that key.

376
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,300
Kramer, I need those cufflinks.

377
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,900
But now they're in the box, 
and the key is in the bird. 

378
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,700
What are we gonna do?

379
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,400
You just answered your own question.

380
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Oh, no.

381
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,400
I'll get the shovel.

382
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
The, uh, actor that played Jesus 
made some odd choices.

383
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,400
What?

384
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,400
I mean, uh... 
I had fun ice skating.

385
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,300
George?

386
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,400
Maura!

387
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
Oh, my God! 
What are you doing here?

388
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
You told me to meet you here for lunch.

389
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Oh, I'm caught in my own web of lies!

390
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,300
I'm Maura.

391
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
I'm Loretta. You want to join us?

392
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,600
This is all blowing up in my face! 

393
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,600
My serious girlfriend and my torrid love affair 
have accidentally crossed paths!

394
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
I have ruined three lives. 

395
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Well, I understand if you 
never want to see me again, so...

396
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,800
George, what we have is too important. 
We can work through this.

397
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,900
So can we.

398
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
What? 

399
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,700
So this is still not over?

400
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,100
No.

401
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,000
You?

402
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No.

403
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,300
All right.

404
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,300
Elaine, wow, a TV, a stereo?

405
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, 
so you won't have to burn 'em.

406
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,900
Oh, my God, Allison. 

407
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,200
You're home early.

408
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Who is this?

409
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,700
His wife.

410
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,000
You're poor <i>and</i> married?

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,100
Looks like it.

412
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,600
Who the hell are you?

413
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I guess I'm Lois Loan.

414
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,900
Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.

415
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
"Man's best friend." 

416
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Jerry, I want something like that 
on my tombstone.

417
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,500
Oh, my God. 
Here he is. 

418
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't want to dig him up.

419
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,700
All right, then you're the one 
getting the key out of him.

420
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,200
I'll dig.

421
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,700
Listen, I heard that 
Lassie #3 is buried around here. 

422
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm gonna go check it out.

423
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,900
Well, that was easy.

424
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,400
All right, honey. 

425
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,400
One last look, 
then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.

426
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Hey, Kramer! 
I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!

427
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh, my God!

428
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Hey, neighbor.

429
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,500
All right.

430
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm gonna try giving them $55 each.

431
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,500
What do you think?

432
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.

433
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,800
So, what are you gonna do? 

434
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Are you gonna live here,
or are you gonna move out, or what?

435
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Ah, I'll just take the fire escape 
to get in and out of the building.

436
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
So, what's in the cooler?

437
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,300
Well, would you look at that. 

438
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,900
Guess I forgot to lock it.

439
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,400
You mean it was open? 

440
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,800
We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?

441
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry? 

442
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Really one for the books.
