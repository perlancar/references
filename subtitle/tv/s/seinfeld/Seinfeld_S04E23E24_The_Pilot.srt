1
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:05,676
To me, the whole concept
of fear of success...

2
00:00:05,854 --> 00:00:09,585
...is proof that we are definitely
scraping the bottom of the fear barrel.

3
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:12,486
Will we have to have AA-type
meetings for these people?

4
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:16,825
"Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing
I'm worried about is having a stereo...

5
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:19,057
...and a cream-colored couch."

6
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:24,765
According to most studies, people's
number-one fear is public speaking.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,272
Number two is death.

8
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:32,010
Death is number two.

9
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:37,784
Now, this means to the average
person, if you have to go to a funeral...

10
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:40,717
...you're better off in the casket
than doing the eulogy.

11
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:47,318
Why can't I play Kramer?

12
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,157
Look, we've been through this
already. You're not an actor.

13
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,856
- Well, neither are you.
- I know.

14
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,830
Why do we need two people
that can't act?

15
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,936
Oh, come on, Jerry.
How hard is it to act?

16
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:58,231
You say something.
I'll pretend it's funny.

17
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:01,405
- What?
- My grandmother's in the hospital.

18
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:05,271
Your grandmother's in the hospital.

19
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:10,979
- This is real believable.
- You didn't think I was laughing?

20
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,143
- It stinks.
- All right, let me see you do it.

21
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,516
- Say something funny.
- All right.

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,558
I've never been to Mars,
but I imagine it's quite lovely.

23
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,057
Mine was better than that.
Come on, look:

24
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,202
- Why are you pretending to laugh?
- We're acting.

25
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,969
Oh, yeah, real good.

26
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,274
- Any word from NBC?
- No.

27
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,381
I don't understand. They're
supposed to be casting this week.

28
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:42,880
Maybe they're not doing it.

29
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,643
Well, at least let me audition.

30
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,684
He wants to play Kramer in the pilot.

31
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:48,322
Out of the question.

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,151
How could we not hear anything?

33
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:52,452
What's with this Russell?
What's he doing?

34
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:59,795
Hi, Russell.
Sit. Sit down. It's okay.

35
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,367
I really appreciate you coming.

36
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:04,767
Oh, that's okay. l... I don't have much
time, though, so...

37
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:06,930
All right, well, first of all...

38
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:09,269
...I want to apologize for
all the phone calls.

39
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:11,275
It's just... It's just...

40
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:16,242
I don't understand.
We went out once, and...

41
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,750
Yeah, that was two months ago.

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,822
Yes, I know, and l... l... I just...
I can't get you out of my mind.

43
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:24,486
Ever since that...

44
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,991
The day in that restaurant
when we met...

45
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:31,729
- Do you have a ketchup secret?
- No, but...

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,237
Russell, you are the president of NBC.

47
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,930
You can have any woman you want.

48
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:42,640
But I want you.

49
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:44,868
God, I hate these mixtures.

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,240
I don't know why... Why don't they
just put pretzels out on the table?

51
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,111
Or even peanuts would be good, but...

52
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:53,118
...I don't know who eats
these cheesy things.

53
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:55,414
Is it something I said?

54
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,818
Or did?

55
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:00,124
Look, Russell...

56
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:04,296
...you're a very sweet guy, but...

57
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:07,433
...I gotta be honest with you.

58
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:09,329
I don't like television.

59
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:13,299
And that's your world.
That's your life.

60
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:17,738
Maybe if you were in Greenpeace or
something, that would be different...

61
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,437
...but network television, I mean...

62
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,641
...come on, Russell.
You're part of the problem.

63
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:26,582
Elaine, we're doing some very
interesting things right now.

64
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,950
We've got very exciting pilots
for next season.

65
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:32,184
We have one with a bright young
comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,659
Oh, yeah, you know, I've heard of him.
He's that:

67
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,731
"Did you ever notice this?
Did you ever notice that?" guy.

68
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,131
In fact, he was in the restaurant
the day that we met.

69
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,598
Well, anyway, it's a
groundbreaking show.

70
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,274
Really? What is it about?

71
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:50,468
Well, really... It's... It's really...
It's very unusual.

72
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:52,713
It's about nothing.

73
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,642
What do you mean, it's about nothing?

74
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:58,278
For example, what did you do today?

75
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:02,922
I got up. I went to work.

76
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:04,718
Then I came here.

77
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,884
There's a show. That's a show.

78
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:09,291
Russell, see, I'm really not
interested in this...

79
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:11,523
...and I do have to...

80
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,964
...go to work, so...
- Elaine, when...? When are we...?

81
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:19,197
- When are we gonna see each other?
- I'm sorry, Russell. I'm sorry, okay?

82
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:21,069
Bye-bye.

83
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,336
- So I'll see you later, huh?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:29,244
Hello. Yeah, he's here. Hey!

85
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,578
- It's for you.
- Oh, yeah?

86
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,277
He's getting phone calls here now?

87
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:34,978
Hello.

88
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,252
Again with the sweatpants?

89
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:38,820
What? I'm comfortable.

90
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,655
You know the message you're
sending with these sweatpants?

91
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,321
You're telling the world, "I give up.

92
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,063
I can't compete in normal society.

93
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:50,295
I'm miserable, so I might
as well be comfortable."

94
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:53,070
Hold on a second, I got another call.

95
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:54,739
Hello.

96
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,337
Yeah, he'll call you back.

97
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,007
- Who is it?
- That's NBC.

98
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:02,672
NBC?!
Give me the phone!

99
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,251
- I'm having a conversation here.
- Get off the phone.

100
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,953
Okay, look, I'll call you back. Yeah.

101
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:10,524
You know I'm waiting
to hear from them.

102
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,252
- Who was it?
- Russell Dalrymple's secretary.

103
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:17,364
All right. Now you're doing
something to help me.

104
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:20,724
Hello. Yes, it's Jerry Seinfeld
returning the call.

105
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,804
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

106
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:29,039
Casting tomorrow at NBC, 4:00.
We're in business. The pilot's on!

107
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,474
You're gonna be successful.

108
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:36,175
What if the pilot gets picked up...

109
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,312
...and it becomes a series?

110
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,387
That would be wonderful.
You'll be rich and successful.

111
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:42,749
That's why I'm worried.

112
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:45,051
God will kill me before letting
me be successful.

113
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,990
- He'll never let me be happy.
- You don't believe in God.

114
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:49,493
I do for the bad things.

115
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,459
Do you hear what you're saying?

116
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:55,768
God isn't out to get you, George.

117
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:58,561
What...?

118
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,765
What is that on your lip?

119
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:05,835
- What?
- It's like a discoloration. It's white.

120
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:12,819
Yes. Yes, it's white.

121
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:16,123
- Why is that white?
- You'd better get that checked out.

122
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,521
- "Better get that checked out"?
- I would.

123
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,319
What kind of a therapist are you?

124
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:23,826
I'm telling you I'm scared
something will happen...

125
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:25,260
...and you look for tumors?

126
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:28,095
- I'm trying to help you.
- What are you, like, a sadist?

127
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:30,760
No matter how bad somebody
feels, you can make it worse.

128
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,100
- You're rooting for a tumor.
- You'd better go.

129
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:35,469
I'm going, baby. I'm going!

130
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,846
- Where?
- Right here.

131
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,648
Get out of here, it's nothing.

132
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:43,845
Excuse me.

133
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,542
Do you see anything on my lip?

134
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,018
Yeah. Like a discoloration.

135
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,589
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's all white.

136
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:52,953
It's all white, Jerry.
It's all white.

137
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:54,355
Would you stop?

138
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,156
I'd get that checked out.

139
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,128
Again with the checked out.

140
00:06:58,299 --> 00:06:59,857
I'm not going to the doctor.

141
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:02,969
If I don't, nothing will happen.
If I go, he might find something.

142
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:05,037
If you go, maybe
they'll catch it in time.

143
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,730
Catch what in time?

144
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:09,575
- Whatever it is.
- You think it's something?

145
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:11,506
I hate these bums with their rags.

146
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:15,012
No, no, no, I don't want it. Get away.
Get away. Get away from my car.

147
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:17,117
You know, these squeegee...

148
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:19,549
Oh, my God,
it's Crazy Joe Davola.

149
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:23,649
Good luck on the pilot, Jerry.

150
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,387
Yeah, I think I see it. It's like a...

151
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,329
...white discoloration.

152
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,200
What do you think it is?

153
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,601
It's like a white discoloration.

154
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:41,198
Okay, guys, are we ready to start?

155
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:43,503
Where's Russell? I thought
he was gonna be here.

156
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:49,173
I don't know. I saw him this morning,
and I said hello. He walked past me.

157
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,443
He must be worried about
the fall schedule.

158
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:53,416
- It's a real bear.
- Yeah.

159
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:56,056
So, what's going on?
We're gonna shoot the pilot...

160
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:58,124
...then it's gonna be on TV
the next week?

161
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,919
Yeah, right.

162
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:01,961
This is Mark Matts.

163
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,064
He'll be auditioning
for the role of George.

164
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,063
- How you doing?
- Hey, Mark, how are you?

165
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,597
They've gotta be kidding.

166
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,601
This guy's perfect.

167
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,865
Okay, let's read this.

168
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,702
And I'll be reading Jerry's part.

169
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,901
Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?

170
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,547
- No, why?
- Listen to me.

171
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:23,513
I told the unemployment office
I was close to a job with them...

172
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,174
...and I gave them your number.

173
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:28,914
When you answer the phone, you've
got to say, "Vandelay Industries."

174
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:31,722
- I'm Vandelay Industries?
- Right.

175
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,588
- What is that?
- You're in latex.

176
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:35,228
What do I do with latex?

177
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:37,921
I don't know. You manufacture it.

178
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:41,257
This is Michael Barth,
another George.

179
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:43,904
- Hi, Michael.
- How you doing?

180
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:46,632
- Everything all right?
- I just came from the podiatrist.

181
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:49,072
Something's wrong with my foot.
A little gangrene.

182
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:50,870
They'll probably have to amputate.

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,911
Any questions?

184
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:56,414
What are we looking at?
Is this guy a real loser?

185
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:58,518
No, not a loser.

186
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,812
Let's start with the second scene.
You have it?

187
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:02,216
- Yeah.
- Okay.

188
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,086
A man gave me a massage.

189
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:08,154
So?

190
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,993
Well, he...

191
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:12,689
He had his hands, you know...

192
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,165
...and he was...
- He was what?

193
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:18,794
Well, he was, you know...
He was touching and rubbing.

194
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,930
That's a massage.

195
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:23,405
I think it moved.

196
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:25,909
This is Melissa Shannon.

197
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,446
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

198
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:31,084
Melissa is reading for Elaine.

199
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:34,246
It's like a bald convention out there.

200
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,647
Sorry, I made a faux pas.

201
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:40,652
No, you didn't,
he knows he's bald.

202
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:43,428
So how about that guy
wearing sweatpants?

203
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:46,226
Is that for the part, or does he
walk around like that?

204
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,233
Okay. Shall we start?

205
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:51,304
You know what?

206
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:52,939
I'll read with her.

207
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,631
Oh, great.

208
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:00,273
- All right, wanna start?
- Yeah.

209
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:01,710
Okay.

210
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:07,213
- What was that look?
- What look?

211
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:08,855
That look you just gave me.

212
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,513
- I gave a look?
- Yes.

213
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:12,989
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

214
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:15,086
Let's see some more Kramers.

215
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,503
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

216
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,774
- How you doing?
- Good.

217
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,919
- What is this about?
- Levels.

218
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,648
- Levels?
- Yeah. Getting rid of all my furniture.

219
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:46,259
All of it. I'm building levels...

220
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:50,989
...with steps, completely carpeted...

221
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,694
...with pillows.

222
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,034
Like ancient Egypt.

223
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,174
How are you gonna be
comfortable like that?

224
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:03,943
I'll be comfortable.

225
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:10,143
- Very good.
- Very nice. Tom, that was terrific.

226
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:11,876
Thank you for coming in.

227
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:14,384
- Wonderful reading.
- That's really something.

228
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:18,221
- Bye.
- Okay. Thank you. Take it easy.

229
00:11:18,392 --> 00:11:20,292
I thought he was really good,
very funny.

230
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,224
Yeah, I liked him.

231
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,963
What happened to the raisins?

232
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,065
Yeah, there was a box
of raisins there.

233
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:30,227
Did he just steal the raisins?

234
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,332
You think he stole them?

235
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,670
This is Martin Van Nostrand.

236
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:39,506
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other?

237
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,705
Wait a minute. I know you.

238
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,282
You're the guy from the Calvin Klein
underwear ads.

239
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:46,348
That's true.

240
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:58,123
I saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts again.

241
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,066
But this time...

242
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,068
...I went in.

243
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,737
Where's the bathroom?

244
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:13,277
I think if you go down the hall,
it's on the right at the very end.

245
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:16,179
Be right back.

246
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:24,084
Sorry, buddy. Full house.

247
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,336
Sorry. Customers only.

248
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,102
Hey, you need a ticket.

249
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:55,220
- So who's playing Elaine?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

250
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:57,050
Very talented young actress.

251
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:58,213
- Really?
- Yes.

252
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:00,223
- Who is it?
- She's an Eskimo, actually.

253
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:02,726
- Oh, God.
- She came down from Juneau by sled.

254
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:06,424
She was in the Iditarod. Got to the
finish line, just kept going.

255
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,864
She's got the dogs with her
in the hotel room.

256
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:10,661
Listen, was Russell at the casting?

257
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:12,772
No, he didn't show up.

258
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,271
You know...

259
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,501
...l'm a little bit worried about him.

260
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:18,736
I don't understand.
We had one date...

261
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,881
...two months ago.

262
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:22,845
Am I that charming and beautiful?

263
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:25,008
No. No, you're not.

264
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,711
- Why do I keep setting you up?
- I don't know.

265
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:30,353
Could we get a little more?

266
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,786
Heat more.

267
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:38,988
Ever since this new owner took over,
the service here is really slow.

268
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,431
Yeah. Have you noticed anything
else that's...

269
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,231
...different since the new
management?

270
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:49,109
They're putting a little lemon
in the tuna. I love that.

271
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,904
Besides that.
Look at the waitresses.

272
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:53,841
Yeah?

273
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,284
What physical...

274
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:02,047
...characteristic would
you say is common to all of them?

275
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:06,754
I mean, look at this.

276
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,829
Every waitress working here has the
same proportions, wouldn't you say?

277
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:13,523
Yes. I would say.

278
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,927
What's going on here?
How is this possible?

279
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:18,936
- Do you think it's a coincidence?
- No.

280
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:22,940
l... I haven't seen four women like this
together outside of a Russ Meyer film.

281
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:29,105
Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the
hiring of waitresses here?

282
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:32,275
He does. We're looking for
another girl if you know anyone.

283
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:37,020
You know what?
That's discriminatory.

284
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:40,490
That is unfair. Why should these
women have all the advantages?

285
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:44,097
They get all the attention from men.
They get all the waitress jobs too?

286
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:47,098
Hey, that's life. Good-looking men
have the same advantage.

287
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:49,202
You don't see
any handsome homeless.

288
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:55,471
You see, it's right here.
It's... It's a little white.

289
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,578
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

290
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:01,508
I've never seen this before.

291
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,109
"Never seen this before"?

292
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,215
I'm gonna have to take
a biopsy on this.

293
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:10,380
- A what?
- A biopsy.

294
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:13,118
- A biopsy?
- Yeah.

295
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,462
Cancer? Is it cancer?
Do I have cancer?

296
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,989
Well, I don't know what it is.

297
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,466
He took a biopsy, Jerry.
A biopsy.

298
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:30,837
- What'd he say?
- He didn't know what it was.

299
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,103
All right, so?

300
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,112
When I asked him about cancer,
he didn't say, "Get out of here."

301
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,012
That's what I wanted to hear,
"Cancer? Get out of here."

302
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:41,519
Maybe he doesn't have a
"get out of here" kind of personality.

303
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:44,123
How could a doctor
not say, "Get out of here"?

304
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,454
It should be part of medical school
training. "Cancer? Get out of here.

305
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,956
Go home. What are you, crazy?

306
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,258
It's a little test. It's nothing.
You're a real nut, you know that?"

307
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:56,829
Told you God would never
let me be successful.

308
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,665
I never should've written that pilot.

309
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,467
The show will be a hit, make
millions, and I'll be dead.

310
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:04,167
Dead, Jerry. Because of this.

311
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:06,370
Can't you at least die
with a little dignity?

312
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:08,242
No, I can't.

313
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:11,077
I can't die with dignity.
I have no dignity.

314
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:14,118
I want to be the person who
doesn't die with dignity.

315
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:17,018
I lived my whole life in shame.
Why die with dignity?

316
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:20,917
Hey.

317
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:23,219
What happened to you yesterday?

318
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:25,628
I got mugged.

319
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,531
- You got mugged?
- Mugged?

320
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:33,435
I wouldn't have minded, but I was
running home to go to the bathroom.

321
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,439
- Why didn't you use it in the building?
- It was full.

322
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:41,679
I tried a few other places, you know,
but that didn't work.

323
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:43,942
I mean, it was an emergency, Jerry.

324
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:46,985
I was really percolating.

325
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:53,555
So I decided to run home through the
park, and then two guys stopped me.

326
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,285
- Yeah?
- It's me.

327
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:56,861
Come on up.

328
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,732
Now I got a big problem, buddy.

329
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:01,496
- What is it?
- Well...

330
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:05,566
I waited so long, l...
I missed my chance.

331
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,637
- You didn't go?
- No, and now I can't get it back.

332
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,514
The best thing to do
is just not think about it.

333
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:22,679
How could you not think about it?

334
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:26,251
- Hey.
- Hey.

335
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,192
What's the matter with him?

336
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:32,855
He's a little backed-up.

337
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,161
Elaine.

338
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:41,468
So I spoke to some of my sisters
about that coffee shop.

339
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:43,633
Oh, the sisters.

340
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:45,676
Have you seen the
waitresses in there?

341
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:48,406
I never had so much coffee in my life.

342
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:52,976
So we decided I should go over
there and apply for a job myself.

343
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,318
Apply for a job? What for?

344
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:56,979
Because it's discriminatory.

345
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:58,715
It's a coincidence.

346
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,723
- This is what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

347
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:02,623
You're not gonna get the job.

348
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,563
Exactly.

349
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,503
Hello.

350
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:12,229
Oh, hi.

351
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,736
Yeah, I guess we could do that.
At what time?

352
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:18,207
All right. I'll see you there.

353
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:19,744
Okay, bye.

354
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,977
- Who's that?
- TV Elaine.

355
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:24,140
She wants to talk about the part.

356
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:28,245
- What about the dogs?
- They're having sex in the hotel room.

357
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:34,458
So the Elaine character is based
on someone you know.

358
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:36,890
- Yes.
- And she's really your ex-girlfriend.

359
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:40,090
- Yeah.
- I want to know her from the inside.

360
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,030
What is she like?
Tell me about her.

361
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:45,296
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland.
She enjoys teasing animals...

362
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:48,566
...Banlon and seeing people
running for their lives.

363
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:52,940
She loves throwing garbage out the
window, yet she's extremely dainty.

364
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:54,512
How would she eat a hamburger?

365
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:56,650
- With her hands.
- What about pasta?

366
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,148
Also with her hands.

367
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,546
Seriously.

368
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,016
I want to experience
everything she's experienced.

369
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:05,783
Everything?

370
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:09,362
- Everything.
- All right, she cuts pasta with a knife.

371
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,191
Good. What's her favorite movie?

372
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:12,696
Shaft.

373
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,630
You gotta give me her picture.
What about sex?

374
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,363
She likes talking during sex.

375
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:19,938
Dirty talking?

376
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:24,237
No. Just chitchat, movies,
current events. Regular stuff.

377
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:26,242
- You know, Sandi...
- Elaine.

378
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,545
- What?
- Call me...

379
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:31,648
...Elaine.

380
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:33,979
All right...

381
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,717
...Elaine.
- How does Elaine kiss?

382
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:41,222
- Well...
- Does she kiss...

383
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:42,987
...like this?

384
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,102
Actually, she has a thing where she
spirals her tongue around. It's like a...

385
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,532
Like this?

386
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,736
I think you got it.

387
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:01,347
Now, I like to eat spaghetti...

388
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:02,914
...with just a fork.

389
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,778
Because I can keep
the strands long...

390
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:08,444
...and I can slurp it up to my mouth
like this. Look.

391
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,659
Now, sex, I like the bottom.

392
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:17,092
Let them do all the work, you know?

393
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:19,425
You should be writing
this stuff down.

394
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,659
Yeah. Bran flakes.

395
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:25,134
One hundred percent.
I got a big problem.

396
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:27,933
- And I'll have the hamburger. That's it.
- Yeah.

397
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,336
- Thanks a lot.
- That's good.

398
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,610
Now, I like to play golf.

399
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,747
Look, this stuff doesn't matter to me.

400
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,781
See, I'm gonna do the character
like me, not like you.

401
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,474
You gotta play him like me.

402
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:40,119
I'm Kramer.

403
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:43,622
- I'm Kramer.
- I'm Kramer.

404
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,725
What can I do for you?
Would you like table?

405
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:48,555
No, I'd like to apply
for a waitress job.

406
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:52,828
Have you ever waited
on tables before?

407
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,992
Oh, yeah. I've been a professional
waitress for the last 10 years.

408
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,637
I've worked all over this city.

409
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,670
These are my references.

410
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,809
I'm sure you'll find
that I'm more than qualified.

411
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:07,480
I don't think I need
anyone else right now.

412
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:15,383
You're in big trouble, mister!
And I mean trouble with a capital T!

413
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,681
What? What did I do?

414
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,188
Anyway, there's at least...

415
00:21:22,162 --> 00:21:25,290
...four of them,
and they're all huge.

416
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:27,160
I mean, one is bigger than the next.

417
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,495
It's like a Russ Meyer movie.

418
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,433
Who's Russ Meyer?

419
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,539
He's this guy who made these...

420
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,575
...terrible movies in the '70s
with these kinds of women.

421
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:38,972
He's obsessed.

422
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:41,080
He's obsessed with breasts.

423
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:43,911
That's hard to say.

424
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:46,109
Anyway, go on.

425
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:50,746
There's not really much more to tell.
He was looking for waitresses...

426
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:55,327
...I went in to apply, and he looked me
up and down, and he rejected me.

427
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:58,726
Paul, come here for a second.
I want you to listen to this.

428
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,696
- Hi.
- Hi.

429
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:04,237
The woman here claims there's
a restaurant on the West Side...

430
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:07,134
...that's only hiring
large-breasted women.

431
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,542
Really?

432
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:14,778
- What do you mean, made-up?
- It's made-up.

433
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,348
Häagen-Dazs is made-up.
It's not Danish.

434
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,417
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

435
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,053
George, is Häagen-Dazs Danish?

436
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:23,382
- What do you mean, Danish?
- This guy stinks.

437
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:25,616
Danish. Is it from Denmark?

438
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,556
They make it in New Jersey.
It's just a Danish-sounding name.

439
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:31,653
I can't believe that.
They fooled me, Jerry.

440
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:34,597
Boy, talk about a show
about nothing.

441
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,057
Excuse me.

442
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:38,532
Excuse me.

443
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,773
This... This is not right.

444
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:42,499
May I?

445
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:50,182
You see, you're going:

446
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,580
"They fooled me, Jerry."

447
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,846
You want to hit "fooled" more.

448
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:56,580
"They fooled me, Jerry."

449
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:58,687
You see the difference?

450
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:00,687
I'm not gonna say it like that.

451
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:03,659
Just a suggestion.

452
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,129
All right, everybody.

453
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:10,896
- Take a five.
- Yep, that's five.

454
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:12,703
George?

455
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,613
I don't have much
experience with acting...

456
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,942
...but from what I can gather...

457
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:26,449
...they're a little touchy about
being told how to say the lines.

458
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:27,943
Why is that?

459
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:31,218
I don't know,
but they don't seem to like it.

460
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,387
By the way, how am I doing?

461
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,051
Oh, you're... You're fine. You're fine.

462
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:41,067
So you think this guy playing Kramer
took the raisins?

463
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:45,471
Why would he steal a box of raisins?

464
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:47,231
Yeah.

465
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,506
It's bizarre.

466
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:53,671
That little bald guy's driving me nuts.

467
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,572
I'm gonna rip him a new one
if he doesn't leave me alone.

468
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,084
I wish that was our real problem.

469
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:01,243
What is the real problem?

470
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:02,683
It's Seinfeld.

471
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,552
He can't act. It's pathetic.

472
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:08,456
I told you these stand-ups can't act.

473
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:11,355
I'm cringing watching him.

474
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:16,763
What's with him?

475
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:19,533
Russell?

476
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,167
Russell?

477
00:24:22,943 --> 00:24:24,308
- What?
- You okay?

478
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:27,914
Yeah. No, l... I was just...

479
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:30,115
...thinking of something.

480
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:31,982
I'll be back in a second.

481
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:40,055
What's the matter?

482
00:24:40,427 --> 00:24:41,416
Nothing.

483
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:43,460
You're acting weird.
Is anything wrong?

484
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,858
No.

485
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:47,192
Are you breaking up with me?

486
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:50,336
Are we going out?

487
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,900
You're breaking up
with me, aren't you?

488
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,568
Do you want me to?

489
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:56,368
If that's what you want.

490
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:58,238
I don't know
what you're talking about.

491
00:24:58,512 --> 00:24:59,604
Fine, break up with me.

492
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,010
All right, we're broken up.

493
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:07,716
Can we still be friends?

494
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:11,213
- Remember when you auditioned?
- Yeah.

495
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,453
There was a box of raisins
on the coffee table.

496
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:19,622
Did you, by any chance,
take them with you when you left?

497
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:22,796
What are you talking about?

498
00:25:23,236 --> 00:25:24,897
Well, we were all eating the raisins.

499
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,939
And I remember you... You were
eating some of the raisins.

500
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,575
And then you left...

501
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:31,438
...and the raisins were gone.

502
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:34,011
I was just wondering if, you know...

503
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:36,172
...maybe you took them with you.

504
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:39,409
Are you accusing me
of stealing the raisins?

505
00:25:39,753 --> 00:25:42,244
- Oh, no, no...
- Why would I steal a box of raisins?

506
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:45,118
No, you wouldn't.
Nobody would, you know.

507
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,487
It's just that...

508
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:50,262
...they were missing, and...

509
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:53,163
...well, I'm just inquiring.

510
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,631
Let me give you a
word of advice, okay?

511
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:57,997
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna talk to you.

512
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:01,629
And I don't wanna hear any more of
your stupid notes and suggestions.

513
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:03,366
I don't like you.

514
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:07,878
So if you got any other problems,
whether it's raisins, prunes...

515
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:11,313
...figs or any other dried fruit...

516
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:14,386
...just keep it to yourself and stay out
of my way, okay?

517
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:19,015
All right.

518
00:26:19,226 --> 00:26:21,717
I don't think we're gonna have any
problem with that.

519
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:25,096
Good talking to you, Tom. Really.

520
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,896
Elaine? Elaine?

521
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:30,593
What do you want?
What can I do?

522
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:32,796
Is...? Is it...?

523
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:35,805
Is it my job? Is that what it is?

524
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:38,711
Elaine, I can't go on like this.

525
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,743
Look, will...? Will...? Will you call me?

526
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:43,507
Would you call me?

527
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:47,244
Well, why? l...
All right, you want...? May I call you?

528
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,388
Elaine? Elaine?

529
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:52,619
Excuse me, Mr. Dalrymple...

530
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,919
...I am so sorry.
- All right, what's your name?

531
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:57,762
- David Richardson.
- Get out, you're fired.

532
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:01,125
- But, Mr. Dalrymple...
- Don't talk back to me!

533
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:03,565
I said, get out.
You want me to call the cops?

534
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:06,467
I make and break little worms
like you every day.

535
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,801
Do you know how much
money I make? Any idea?

536
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:10,203
Do you know where I live?

537
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:13,107
I could have any woman in this city
that I want. Anyone.

538
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,009
Now, get out!

539
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:20,018
What are you all looking at?!

540
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:22,855
Go back to work.

541
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,252
Back!

542
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:27,050
Back!

543
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:40,072
Doctor called and said I'm not gonna
get the results for another two days.

544
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,071
Oh, you're fine.
There's nothing wrong.

545
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:43,607
I'm the one who's dying.

546
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:45,472
- What do you mean?
- I can't act.

547
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:47,545
I stink. I don't know what I'm doing.

548
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:50,576
I'm gonna make a fool out of myself.

549
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:54,183
Come on, you're...

550
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:55,878
You're fine.

551
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:58,281
This show's gonna ruin my career.

552
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,559
- How did I get involved?
- What about me?

553
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:02,991
I was a total failure.
Everything was fine.

554
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:06,758
Now this thing's gonna be a success,
and God gives me a terminal disease.

555
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:09,094
This actress playing Elaine,
she's crazy.

556
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:11,133
The guy playing Kramer
threatened me.

557
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:14,239
- Why?
- I asked him about the raisins.

558
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:17,704
You mentioned the raisins.

559
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:20,709
- Oh, yeah.
- Did he take them?

560
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:23,439
I don't know.

561
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:26,015
Well, if he didn't take them...

562
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:27,778
...what happened to them?

563
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:31,046
That's what I'm trying to find out.

564
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:37,827
- Hey.
- Hey.

565
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:40,864
- Any luck?
- No. No, nothing.

566
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:44,298
I got no peristalsis.

567
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:46,697
- Well, what about bran?
- I tried bran.

568
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:49,205
Forty percent, 50 percent,
100 percent.

569
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:51,640
The bran isn't working for me.

570
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,438
- Well, what about Meta...?
- Did it.

571
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:54,944
- How about Ex...?
- Yeah, had it.

572
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:57,174
- Milk of Magne...?
- Yeah, yeah.

573
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:00,553
Well, my friend...

574
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:05,317
...it may be time to consider
the dreaded apparatus.

575
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:09,223
Hold it right there.

576
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:12,524
If you're suggesting what I think,
you're wasting your time.

577
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:15,930
I am not, Jerry, under any
circumstances, doing any...

578
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:18,696
...inserting in that area.

579
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:20,396
Oh, it's not that bad.

580
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:22,734
Yes, it is.

581
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,337
Well...

582
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:28,344
...it's all taken care of. I filed a report.
An investigation is under way.

583
00:29:28,648 --> 00:29:29,945
So you going to the taping?

584
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:33,051
No, I don't think I should go.
I don't want to bump into Russell.

585
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:34,686
He called me the other day.

586
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:38,221
Come on, you gotta go. He's harmless.
He's got a little crush on you.

587
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:42,259
Jerry, this is not a crush.
This is a complete fixation.

588
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:44,226
He makes me very uncomfortable.

589
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:45,955
We need you there.

590
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:50,030
- Hey, are you gonna go?
- No, no, l... I'm gonna stay home. I...

591
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:55,402
I wanna be close to my home base, in
case there's any news from the front.

592
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:07,876
No. Pick it up more in the front.
It's gotta be higher. Higher.

593
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:10,515
Make a wall. A wall.

594
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:12,708
Sandi, are you in wardrobe?

595
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:15,013
- Sandi?
- Try "Elaine."

596
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:17,622
- Elaine?
- Yes?

597
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:24,392
Elaine?

598
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:26,927
It's me.

599
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,625
Wilton Marshall. Remember?

600
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:31,794
Camp Tioga, 1978?

601
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:34,269
- Remember?
- Right.

602
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,176
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

603
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:44,444
- I can't remember my lines.
- Just relax, you'll be fine.

604
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:46,983
I can't relax. I don't...
I don't know any of them.

605
00:31:47,153 --> 00:31:49,314
You're just like George.
He'd do the same thing.

606
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:51,650
- You're just like him. It's amazing.
- Help me.

607
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,793
George is always saying that.

608
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,224
You don't have to worry anyway.
It's not live.

609
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:58,489
It's not on till next week.
Have a good show.

610
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:00,963
What's my first line?
Just tell me my first line.

611
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:03,864
- "New sneakers."
- "New sneakers." Right, that's it.

612
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:07,862
Where's Russell?

613
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:11,343
You know, I don't know.
I assumed he wouldn't miss it.

614
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:13,945
He hasn't been well.

615
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:17,448
Can I tell you something
in confidence?

616
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:19,643
I think it's a woman.

617
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:21,446
How pathetic.

618
00:32:21,621 --> 00:32:25,751
Yeah, this is George Costanza.
I'm... I'm calling for my test results.

619
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,987
Negative?

620
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,991
Oh, my God!

621
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:35,464
Why? Why? Why?

622
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:38,100
What?

623
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,431
Negative's good?

624
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:44,837
Yes, of course.
How stupid of me.

625
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:48,105
Thank you. Thank you very much.

626
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:52,512
What was I worried about?

627
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,077
Listen.

628
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:22,214
I know we've had our
problems in the past...

629
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:26,250
...but we got a show to do tonight.
Time to pull together as a team.

630
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:27,647
Life's too short.

631
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,449
I say, let's let bygones be bygones.

632
00:33:31,624 --> 00:33:34,752
If you took the raisins,
if you didn't take the raisins...

633
00:33:34,928 --> 00:33:37,055
They weren't even my raisins.

634
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,857
l... I was just curious because...

635
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,665
...seems like a strange
thing to do...

636
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:48,137
...to walk into a room, audition
and walk out with a box of raisins.

637
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:50,475
Anyway, whatever.

638
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:54,238
If you ever want to tell me about it,
the door to my office is always open.

639
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:56,575
In the event that I get an office.

640
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:00,617
You'll come in. We'll talk about the
raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.

641
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:03,450
How would you like it if I just...

642
00:34:03,623 --> 00:34:07,218
...pulled your heart out of your chest
now and shoved it down your throat?

643
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,456
Good evening. Welcome to a taping
of the new show Jerry.

644
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,101
Does everybody know what a pilot is?

645
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,899
- Yeah, he flies a plane.
- No, a pilot is the taping of a show...

646
00:34:21,074 --> 00:34:23,565
...that's the first show
before a TV series.

647
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:26,371
And this show will air on Thursday.

648
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:30,271
Are you ready to meet our cast?
All right.

649
00:34:37,557 --> 00:34:39,752
Good evening, folks.
How you doing?

650
00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:43,690
You sound like a great crowd.

651
00:34:43,863 --> 00:34:46,491
We have a show we're gonna put on
for you tonight.

652
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,328
It's a... It's a new TV show.
It's what they call a pilot.

653
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:53,461
And we hope it becomes a series.
It's called Jerry. I'm playing Jerry...

654
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,870
Sic semper tyrannis!

655
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:08,286
What about Davola?
Did you believe that?

656
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:11,719
What was that thing he yelled out,
sic semper tyrannis? Is that Latin?

657
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,086
John Wilkes Booth yelled it
when he shot Lincoln.

658
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,751
- Really? What's it mean?
- It means "death to tyrants."

659
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,358
I could see that.

660
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:23,396
See, now, this is exciting!
This is exciting!

661
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:26,732
- Did I miss anything already?
- No, it starts in five minutes.

662
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:28,567
You were there.
What's the big deal?

663
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:30,971
Now it's on TV. It's different.

664
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:33,611
- I told everybody I know to watch it.
- Yeah, me too.

665
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:36,604
- Did you hear from Russell?
- No.

666
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:38,910
Strange, him not showing up
at the taping.

667
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:48,558
Well, well.

668
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:50,992
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.

669
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:53,792
- You went for the big E, huh?
- Wet and wild.

670
00:35:55,068 --> 00:35:57,696
- Kramer, sit down. It's about to start.
- Oh, yes.

671
00:36:00,673 --> 00:36:02,800
Hey, what is this?

672
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:04,943
Look, a wallet.

673
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:07,978
- A wallet? Let me see that.
- Here.

674
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:12,083
It's my father's wallet. He thought
they stole it at the doctor's office.

675
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:15,015
- This is it.
- How do you like that?

676
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:50,751
You hurt me.

677
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,823
- Hey.
- Hey, George.

678
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:57,654
- New sneakers?
- Yeah.

679
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,492
- What do you need new sneakers for?
- I like sneakers.

680
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:04,494
How do you decide which ones to
wear? I'd go crazy if I had to decide.

681
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,331
You're crazy anyway.

682
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,664
Why did you eat the top
off the muffins?

683
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:12,174
- So what?
- I can't eat it now.

684
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:14,242
- George.
- George.

685
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:17,614
What kind of stupid show is this?

686
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:22,221
Hey, that's that idiot that took
all my records.

687
00:37:23,956 --> 00:37:26,982
John, what are you doing?
Come back to bed.

688
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,594
This show looks interesting.

689
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:32,196
Isn't he that Seinfeld fella you
went out with?

690
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:34,728
Oh, he's horrible. Horrible.

691
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:36,299
Nevertheless.

692
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,567
That Jerry's a funny guy, huh?

693
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:40,467
Got to love the "Sein."

694
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,369
I hate the "Sein."

695
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:53,977
This is a piece of crap.

696
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:56,280
Oh, Donald, you used to like him.

697
00:37:56,455 --> 00:37:57,717
What a sellout.

698
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,721
Give me that remote. Give me that.

699
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:01,889
- Give me the remote.
- Donald.

700
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:04,825
- Jerry, the commercial's almost over.
- All right.

701
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:07,397
You know, I really like this guy
playing the butler.

702
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:09,432
Yeah, he's good.
He's John Ritter's cousin.

703
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:12,261
- Really?
- Yeah.

704
00:38:14,774 --> 00:38:16,674
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello.

705
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:19,107
So where do you want me
to start today?

706
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:22,941
- Why don't you start in the bedroom.
- I'll start in your bedroom.

707
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,544
- Hey.
- Hey. The butler's here.

708
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,550
He is? Listen.

709
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:30,746
When he's finished,
send him over to my house.

710
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:33,084
- I'm not sending him to your house.
- Why not?

711
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:36,228
The judge decreed he'd become
my butler, not my friend's butler.

712
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:39,193
Jerry, he is your butler. You can give
him any order you want.

713
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:42,027
- That's what butlers do.
- But I don't want to.

714
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,897
Jerry, my house is
a pigsty. Come on.

715
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:48,434
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

716
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:50,166
Come on up.

717
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:54,302
- I need more Pledge.
- More Pledge?

718
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,506
I just bought two cans last week,
and I don't have any wood here.

719
00:38:57,683 --> 00:38:59,776
Well, it goes fast.

720
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:04,814
Hello.

721
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:06,247
Hello.

722
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:14,063
What's all this about?

723
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:16,997
- We had a date last week.
- You had a date?

724
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,536
You went out with my butler? Who
said you could go out with my butler?

725
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:24,836
- Why do I need your permission?
- Because he's my butler.

726
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:27,909
That's terrific.

727
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,581
How could anyone not like him?

728
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,116
I like his style.

729
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:36,187
He has a sort of casual elegance.

730
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:37,913
But he picks his nose.

731
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,081
Nevertheless.

732
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:42,853
He's a member of our
health club, isn't he?

733
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:45,125
Yeah.

734
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:50,258
You know, that Kim Novak
had some big breasts.

735
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,309
You ever notice a lot of butlers
are named Jeeves?

736
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:04,306
You know, I think when you...
When you name a baby Jeeves...

737
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:08,484
...you've pretty much mapped out
his future, wouldn't you say?

738
00:40:08,654 --> 00:40:12,112
Not much chance he's gonna be
a hit man, I think, after that.

739
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,351
"I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but I'm going to have to whack you."

740
00:40:17,964 --> 00:40:19,192
Yeah.

741
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,800
Oh, wow, that was great.

742
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:24,527
That show was so funny.

743
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:27,867
It was really funny. I'm not just
saying that because I know you.

744
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,668
All right. Well, let's go out
and celebrate.

745
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:33,208
- That was so good.
- Come on, let's eat something.

746
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:36,212
I think this will get picked up, George.
You're gonna be rich!

747
00:40:36,382 --> 00:40:38,179
- You really think so?
- Oh, yeah.

748
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:39,875
And God didn't kill me.

749
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:41,709
- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry.

750
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:44,856
- This is Rita Kirson.
- Oh, hi, Rita.

751
00:40:45,024 --> 00:40:46,389
I'm calling to let you know...

752
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,891
...Russell Dalrymple is
no longer with this network.

753
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:50,929
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?

754
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,327
To be honest with you,
nobody really knows.

755
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:55,194
He seems to have disappeared.

756
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:56,892
Russell's disappeared?

757
00:40:57,269 --> 00:41:00,363
In any event, I've been made
the new president of NBC.

758
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:02,063
As you may or may not know...

759
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:06,007
...Russell and I did not see eye to eye
on many, many projects.

760
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:10,740
And as my first order of business,
I'm passing on your show.

761
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,545
You're passing already?
The show just ended two minutes ago.

762
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,950
Well, I just got the job.

763
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:18,920
Goodbye, Jerry.

764
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:22,354
Yeah. See you.

765
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:28,926
What are you...?
What are you looking at me for?

766
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:31,729
- It was you.
- What...? What did I do?

767
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,532
Do you realize his obsession with you
cost us a TV series?!

768
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,039
I didn't know that he'd fall for me,
and I'd drive him insane, I mean...

769
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,474
- You know, that's not my fault.
- Yes, it is!

770
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:42,375
You're very charming!

771
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:45,047
I can't believe this.

772
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:46,809
What happened to him?
Where is he?

773
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:49,048
No one knows.

774
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:53,582
She works for Pendant Publishing.

775
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:57,160
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

776
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,762
You know...

777
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:03,391
...I used to work for NBC,
but when I go back to her this time...

778
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:05,764
...she'll respect me.

779
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:10,937
You'd better get down.
They might start firing soon.

780
00:42:23,923 --> 00:42:25,356
Hey, look at this.

781
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:26,752
What is going on here?

782
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:28,291
Well, well.

783
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:30,290
Nothing has changed.

784
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:31,862
How did this happen?

785
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:36,459
I talked to these guys at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.

786
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:39,160
Hey. What are you two guys
doing here?

787
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:42,364
I thought you were gonna do
something. Now you're eating here?

788
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:45,938
No, that's... That's... That's why
we're here. We're checking things out.

789
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:48,080
- We're checking it out.
- Checking it out?

790
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:50,238
See you back at the office, guys.

791
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,010
Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner?

792
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:56,518
Boy, you guys ought to move in.

793
00:42:56,689 --> 00:42:58,520
How about a piece of pie, on me, huh?

794
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:00,852
Sophia, take care of these fellows.

795
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,051
Hey, come here.
I want you to know something.

796
00:43:03,229 --> 00:43:05,663
You are not gonna get
away with this.

797
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:09,130
- Get away with what?
- "With what?" You know what.

798
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:12,202
With the waitresses,
how they're all alike.

799
00:43:14,473 --> 00:43:16,737
Of course they're alike.

800
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:18,536
They are my daughters.

801
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:24,277
Your daughters.

802
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:27,645
You must be very proud, Mr. Visaki.

803
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,256
And may I say, sir, they're lovely girls.
Absolutely lovely girls.

804
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:33,516
It's nice to see such fine,
upstanding women...

805
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:36,991
...in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
- Here's table for you.

806
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:38,653
- Oh, a table right here.
- Peggy.

807
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:40,560
Peggy. All right.

808
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:42,724
- Peggy?
- Peggy. His daughter Peggy.

809
00:43:42,902 --> 00:43:44,597
Peggy's coming over to serve.

810
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,260
One of the family.

811
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:48,963
- My daughter Peggy.
- Peggy.

812
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:50,369
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Peggy.

813
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:52,670
Thank you very much.

814
00:43:54,513 --> 00:43:56,913
- So guess what I gotta do tomorrow.
- What?

815
00:43:57,082 --> 00:43:59,346
Start looking for a job.

816
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:01,008
You know what you ought to do?

817
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:02,711
You should work for Greenpeace.

818
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:05,584
You know, they attack the whalers
out on the open sea.

819
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:07,123
Are you crazy?

820
00:44:07,293 --> 00:44:10,456
You take your life in your hands
with those nuts.

821
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:14,926
Keep fighting it, matey.
Get your head above the water.

822
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:17,500
I've got you, matey.

823
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,468
I got you. Matey.

824
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,371
I'll remember her name.

825
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,907
Elaine Benes.

826
00:44:25,077 --> 00:44:26,704
I'll write to her.

827
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:30,815
I'll tell her all about you
and what you did out here.

828
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:32,951
Goodbye, matey.

829
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:34,449
Goodbye.

830
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:45,893
Now, I know women often complain
about the number of things...

831
00:44:46,065 --> 00:44:48,226
...you have to do to get male attention.

832
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,300
The high heels, the pantyhose,
the makeup.

833
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:52,403
It's even worse if you're a man.

834
00:44:52,571 --> 00:44:54,801
If you're a man,
you don't know what to do.

835
00:44:54,974 --> 00:44:57,602
That's why we're building bridges,
climbing mountains...

836
00:44:57,776 --> 00:45:02,236
...exploring uncharted territories.
You think we wanna do these things?

837
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:04,075
Nobody wants to build a bridge.

838
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:07,850
It's really, really hard.

839
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:11,855
Designing rockets,
flying off into space.

840
00:45:12,024 --> 00:45:15,289
I guarantee you, every astronaut,
when he comes back from space...

841
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:19,056
...goes up to a girl and goes,
"So did you see me up there?"
