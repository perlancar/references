1
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,200
Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera.

2
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,100
Tonight we'll be talking about 

3
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,800
what most of you have probably 
been discussing in your homes, 

4
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,600
and around the water coolers 
in your offices.

5
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
I am speaking of course of the 
controversial Good Samaritan trial 

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,600
that gets underway Thursday 
in Latham, Massachusetts.

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,200
Now before we meet 
our distinguished panel, 

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,100
let's go to Latham live, 
where Jane Wells is standing by.

9
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,900
Jane.

10
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,400
Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.

11
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,100
What's the mood?

12
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,500
What's going on tonight?

13
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,400
Well, Latham is fairly quiet tonight, 

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
considering the media circus that has 
descended upon this quaint little town.

15
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,500
And what about the defendants - 
the so-called New York Four.

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,900
How are they holding up?

17
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,200
Well, I did speak with one of the deputies 
who had some contact with them, 

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,200
and he told me, quote: 
"There's no love lost with that group."

19
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,900
Anything else, Jane?

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,900
There also seems to be some friction 
between Mr. Seinfeld and Ms. Benes.

21
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,900
The rumor is that they once dated, 
and it's possible that ended badly.

22
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,800
Well, ladies and gentlemen, 
who knows, 

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
maybe this trial will bring them 
closer together.

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Maybe they'll even end up getting married.

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,600
I hope you packed enough. 
This trial could last for weeks.

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
What's all that?

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,900
Cereal.

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,400
You're packing cereal?

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm bringing it for Jerry.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
You got enough here for a life sentence.

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
He likes it.

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,100
He says he misses that 
more that anything.

33
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
So bring a snack-pack.

34
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,200
Poor Georgie, 
was it our fault this happened to him?

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Did we do something wrong?

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,100
Maybe it was our fault.

37
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,800
Maybe it was your fault.

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
It wasn't my fault.
I can tell you that.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,600
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,100
You were the one who smothered him.

41
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,800
I did not smother him.

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,700
You smothered!

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,500
He couldn't get any air!
He couldn't breathe!

44
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,200
He was suffocating!

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Sure, and you were always in Korea 
with your religious tchatchkes.

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
I had to make a living!

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is excellent huh?

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, 
cause I know we gotta make it last.

49
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,500
You know I've had to reduce my milk level.

50
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,300
My whole life I've always filled 
to at least three quarters. 

51
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,700
Sometimes, to the top of the cereal.

52
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,600
Now, to conserve, 
I can't even see the milk anymore.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
It's a big adjustment.

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,300
I bet.

55
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,300
It's one of the hardest things 
I've ever had to do.

56
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
Good morning.

57
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Good morning, Jackie.

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,900
Good morning.

59
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,400
Is everybody ready?

60
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,100
Didn't I tell you 
I wanted you to wear the cardigan?

61
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,200
It makes me look older.

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,300
Look older?

63
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
Do you think this is a game?

64
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,800
Is that what you think this is?

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,900
I'm trying to give you a moral compass.

66
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,400
You have no moral compass.

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
You're going to walk into that courtroom, 

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,500
and the jury's going to see 
a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,100
I want them to see Perry Como.

70
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,800
No one's going to convict Perry Como.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Perry Como helps out 
a fat tub who's getting robbed.

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you think it's funny?

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,100
No.

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,400
You damn right it isn't.

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,900
You better not be carrying on laughing 
in that courtroom, funny man.

76
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, 
making wisecracks, acting a fool, 

77
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,000
you gonna find yourself in here 
for a long, long time.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't like that tie.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,900
Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.

80
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,200
How do I look, Jackie?

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Oh, you looking good.

82
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,800
You look strong.

83
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,300
You one fine-looking sexy lady.

84
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,600
Thank you, Jackie.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,700
How 'bout me, Jackie?

86
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Kramer, you always look good.

87
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,100
You got respect for yourself.

88
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,200
You're genuine.

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Jury's going to pick up on that.

90
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Here.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
This one?
- That's right.

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,500
Do I have to?

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Jackie says put it on, Jerry.

94
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,100
All rise.

95
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,400
Fourth District County Court,
Latham, Massachusetts is now in session.

96
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,100
The Honorable Judge 
Arthur Vandelay presiding.

97
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,300
Vandelay?

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,800
The judge's name is Vandelay?

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
Vanda who?

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Jerry, did you hear that?
- Yeah.

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
I think that's a good sign.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
Is the District Attorney 
ready to proceed?

103
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
We are, Your Honor.

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Mr. Hoyt.

105
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,400
Ladies and gentlemen, 

106
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
last year, our City Council, 
by a vote of 12:2, passed a Good Samaritan Law.

107
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Now, essentially, we made it a crime 
to ignore a fellow human being in trouble.

108
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Now this group from New York 
not only ignored, but, as we will prove, 

109
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
they actually mocked the victim 
as he was being robbed at gunpoint.

110
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,400
I can guarantee you one other thing, 
ladies and gentlemen, 

111
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
this is not the first time 
they have behaved in this manner.

112
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,400
On the contrary, 

113
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,900
they have quite a record 
of mocking and maligning.

114
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,900
This is a history of selfishness, 
self-absorption, immaturity, and greed.

115
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
And you will see 

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,300
how everyone who has come into contact 
with these four individuals 

117
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,300
has been abused, wronged, 
deceived and betrayed.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,800
This time, they have gone too far.

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
This time they are going to be 
held accountable.

120
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
This time, they are the ones who will pay.

121
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,600
Mr. Chiles.

122
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,500
I am shocked and chagrined, 

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,600
mortified and stupefied.

124
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
This trial is outrageous!

125
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,700
It is a waste of 
the taxpayers' time and money.

126
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,500
It is a travesty of justice that 
these four people have been incarcerated 

127
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,300
while the real perpetrator is 
walking around laughing - 

128
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,300
lying and laughing, 
laughing and lying.

129
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,200
You know what these four people were?

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
They were innocent bystanders.

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,000
Now, you just think about that term.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Innocent.

133
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,700
Bystanders.

134
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,300
Because that's exactly 
what they were.

135
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,600
We know they were bystanders, 
nobody's disputing that.

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,100
So how can a bystander be guilty?

137
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
No such thing.

138
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,800
Have you ever heard of 
a guilty bystander?

139
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,800
No, because you cannot 
be a bystander and be guilty.

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
Bystanders are 
by definition innocent.

141
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,500
That is the nature of bystanding.

142
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,500
But no, 
they want to change nature here.

143
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
They want to create a whole new animal - 
the guilty bystander.

144
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Don't you let them do it.

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Only you can stop them.

146
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,800
Is the prosecution ready 
to present its first witness?

147
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
We are, Your Honor.

148
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,400
Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.

149
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Call Matt Vogel.

150
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
So they were just standing there?

151
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,300
Yes.

152
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,800
Did one of them have a video camera?

153
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Yes.

154
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,100
Your Honor, with the court's permission, 
we would like to play back that video 

155
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,000
and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,900
Proceed.

157
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,400
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.

158
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,700
See, the great thing about 
robbing a fat guy is, it's an easy getaway.

159
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,500
They can't really chase ya!

160
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,300
He's actually doing him a favor.

161
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,300
It's less money for him to buy food.

162
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
So they just stood there and did nothing?

163
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,400
Yeah, nothing.

164
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Nothing!

165
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,700
No further questions.

166
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,800
Hey!

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
Great plane!

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Thanks a lot.

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,700
Piece of junk.

170
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,700
You know you almost got us killed!

171
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,400
Call Mabel Choate to the stand.

172
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Call Mabel Choate.

173
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,700
Your Honor.

174
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,100
I most strenuously and vigorously 
object to this witness.

175
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,000
She was not present 
at the time of the incident.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,700
Her testimony is irrelevant, 
irrational, and inconsequential.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Your Honor, the prosecution has 
gone to great lengths and considerable cost 

178
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,900
to find these character witnesses.

179
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,800
It is imperative that we establish 
this is not merely an isolated incident.

180
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior 
that's been going on for years.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,600
Objection overruled.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll hear the witness.

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,300
Now, Mrs. Choate, 

184
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
would you please tell the court 
what happened the evening of January 4th.

185
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery 
when I got accosted by that man.

186
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Let the record show that she 
is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.

187
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,300
What did he want?

188
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
My marble rye.

189
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
Your marble rye?

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
I got the last one.

191
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
He kept persisting, and I said no.

192
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,700
And then you left the bakery.

193
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,600
That's right.

194
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,900
But it didn't end there, 
did it, Mrs. Choate?

195
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,600
Oh no.

196
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,500
Gimme that rye.

197
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,300
Stop it.

198
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
I want that rye lady.

199
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
Help - someone help.

200
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Shut up, you old bag!

201
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,700
No further questions.

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,800
I call Marla Penny to the stand.

203
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Call Marla Penny.

204
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,500
The virgin!

205
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,800
And what was your connection 
to the defendants?

206
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I dated Mr. Seinfeld 
for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.

207
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,800
Then on the evening of October 28, 
there was an abrupt end to that relationship.

208
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,100
Tell us what happened.

209
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,200
It's rather difficult to talk about.

210
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,900
It's alright.

211
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Take your time.

212
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,400
Well, I became aware of a -

213
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
A what?

214
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,900
A, uh -

215
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,700
Yes?

216
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
A contest.

217
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Contest?

218
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,600
Yes.

219
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,900
What was the nature of the contest?

220
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,400
Oh please, I can't.

221
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,800
It's okay.

222
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,400
The four of them made a wager 
to see if they could -

223
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes?

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
To see who could go the longest 
without gratifying themselves.

225
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,600
For the love of God!

226
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
It was horrible, horrible!

227
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,100
Call Donald Sanger to the stand.

228
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
Who the hell is that?

229
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,400
Come on Donald, you're doing fine.

230
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,900
The Bubble Boy!

231
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,800
Bubble Boy?

232
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,900
That's right, the Bubble Boy.

233
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,200
What's a Bubble Boy?

234
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,300
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.

235
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,500
What the hell are all you looking at?

236
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,100
So Donald, 
would you please tell the court 

237
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,100
about the incident that occurred 
in your house, October 7th, 1992.

238
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,700
Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to 
come to my house, 

239
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,400
but his friend Costanza 
showed up instead, 

240
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,200
so I challenged him 
to a game of Trivial Pursuit.

241
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,500
Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,700
That's a joke - the Moors.

243
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops.

244
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,700
The correct answer is the Moops.

245
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,900
Moops?

246
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,800
Let me see that.

247
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,200
That's not Moops, you jerk.

248
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,400
It's Moors.

249
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
It's a misprint.

250
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Sorry, the card says Moops.

251
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,800
It doesn't matter.

252
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,400
It's Moors - there's no Moops.

253
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,500
It's Moops.

254
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,200
Moors!

255
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,900
Moops!

256
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,600
Help! Someone!

257
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
There's no Moops, you idiot.

258
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,700
Stop it! Let go of him!

259
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,200
Donald, stop it.

260
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,200
No. Donald, stop it.

261
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,400
It was Moops.

262
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
Moors.

263
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,300
So Mr. Costanza 
parked in a handicapped spot, 

264
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,300
and as a result you got in an accident, 
and your wheelchair was destroyed?

265
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
That's right.

266
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,000
And then Mr. Kramer 
gave you a used wheelchair?

267
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's right.

268
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,000
So you were the doctor on duty 
the night Susan Ross died?

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,700
Yes, that's right.

270
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,700
It was May 16th, 1996.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
I'll never forget it.

272
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,100
So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza?

273
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,300
Could you tell the court, please, 
what his reaction was?

274
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,300
I would describe it as 
restrained jubilation.

275
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Murderer!

276
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,300
He killed our daughter!

277
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,200
He knew those envelopes were toxic!

278
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Order in this court!

279
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Call Sidra Holland to the stand.

280
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Look at this one, she fine.

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You dated her?

282
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,400
So you met Jerry Seinfeld 
in a health club sometime in 1993?

283
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes.

284
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,100
And you also met Miss Benes 
in that same health club?

285
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Yes, that's true.

286
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,600
Would you describe 
the circumstances of that meeting.

287
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.

288
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,300
You know, I've seen you around the club.

289
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,200
My name's Sidra.

290
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,400
This is Marcie.

291
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.

292
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
So, she pretended to trip, 
and she fell into your breasts?

293
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Yes.

294
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Why would she do something like that?

295
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Because he sent her in there 
to find out if they were real.

296
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,200
State your name.

297
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,700
Bookman, Joe Bookman.

298
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,100
And what's your occupation?

299
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
I'm a library cop.

300
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,400
What does a library cop do?

301
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
We chase down library delinquents.

302
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Anyone in this room ever delinquent?

303
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Yeah, he was. 
Right over there - Seinfeld.

304
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,400
How long was his book overdue?

305
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,300
25 years.

306
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
We don't call them 
delinquent after that long.

307
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,000
What do you call them?

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Criminals.

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,100
So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.

310
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,400
Yes.

311
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,300
And then what happened?

312
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Well, I invited him 
to attend my son's birthday party and -

313
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,200
Fire!

314
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Get out of the way!

315
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,200
At the time, 
I was employed as a security guard 

316
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,200
in the parking garage 
at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.

317
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,800
Why would I do it 
unless I was in mortal danger?

318
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,300
I know it's against the law.

319
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,500
I don't know.

320
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning 
and die - that's why.

321
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,700
Uromycitisis!

322
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
I wonder if they're 
having any trouble 

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,900
controlling themselves 
during this trial?

324
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,100
Perhaps these two hooligans 

325
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,200
would like to have a pee party 
right here in the courtroom!

326
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,300
Objection, Your Honor!

327
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,700
This is completely inappropriate!

328
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,100
My clients' medical condition 
is not on trial here!

329
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
May I refer you to the 
Disability Act of 1990?

330
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,500
Sit down, Mr. Chiles.

331
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,400
Alright, Detective, 
then what happened?

332
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
We got a tip that 

333
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,500
a lot of prostitutes had been 
turning tricks in the parking lot.

334
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,900
You just cost me some money.

335
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,200
Cool it, lady. 

336
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
Cool it.

337
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Cool it, lady.

338
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Cool it.

339
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,900
Police officers - freeze right there!

340
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,900
So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.

341
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,700
So you asked Mr. Seinfeld 

342
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,700
if he would wear your puffy shirt 
on the Today Show?

343
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
Excuse me?

344
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, 
but what is the point of this testimony?

345
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,500
This woman's a low-talker.

346
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
I can't hear a word she's saying.

347
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,500
So either get 
some other kind of microphone up there, 

348
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,900
or let's move on.

349
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,600
Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.

350
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,800
Call George Steinbrenner.

351
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,100
So George Costanza came to work for you 
in May of 1994?

352
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,200
Yes, that's right, he was good kid - 
a lovely boy.

353
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,900
Shared his calzone with me - 

354
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,100
that was a heck of a sandwich, 
wasn't it, Georgie?

355
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,900
Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.

356
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,200
He had one little problem though.

357
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
What was that?

358
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,500
He was a communist.

359
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,700
Thick as they come.

360
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Like a big juicy steak.

361
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,500
How could you give twelve million dollars 
to Hideki Irabu?

362
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Order!

363
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,300
Cock fighting?

364
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,400
Cock fighting.

365
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,300
Sponges.

366
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500
I don't mean 
the kind you clean your tub with.

367
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,300
They're for sex.

368
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,300
She said she needed 
a whole case of them.

369
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,400
She exposed her nipple.

370
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
How did she try to kill you?

371
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,400
She tried to smother me with a pillow.

372
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,800
Call Yev Kassem to the stand.

373
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,900
Call Yev Kassem.

374
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,200
Who?

375
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,900
The Soup Nazi!

376
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,000
Soup Nazi?

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,300
You people have a little pet name 
for everybody.

378
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
State your name.

379
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,400
Yev Kassem.

380
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
Could you spell that, please?

381
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
No! Next question.

382
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
How do you know the defendants?

383
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,600
They used to come to my restaurant.

384
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Medium turkey chili.

385
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Medium crab bisque.

386
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,100
I didn't get any bread.

387
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,000
Just forget it. Let it go.

388
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,200
Um, excuse me, 
I think you forgot my bread.

389
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
You want bread?

390
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Yes, please.

391
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Three dollars!

392
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,800
What?

393
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,800
No soup for you!

394
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,700
But the idiot clowns 
did not know how to order.

395
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,100
I banned that one - the woman - 
for a year.

396
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,500
Then one day, she came back.

397
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,300
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms.

398
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,400
Half a cup of olive oil.

399
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,500
Three pounds celery.

400
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,700
That's my recipe for wild mushroom.

401
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,400
You're through, Soup Nazi.

402
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,600
Pack it up.

403
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
No more soup for you.

404
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,200
Next!

405
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,700
She published my recipes.

406
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,200
I had to close the store, 
move to Argentina.

407
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
She ruined my business!

408
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Soup's not all that good anyway.

409
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,700
What did you say?

410
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,400
The state calls 
Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.

411
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,600
How did they find Babu?

412
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I thought he was deported.

413
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,400
You came a long way to be here today, 
haven't you?

414
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Yes, all the way from Pakistan.

415
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,300
And what's your connection 
to the defendant?

416
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,600
I owned a restaurant.

417
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Seinfeld told me to 
change the menu to Pakistani.

418
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,300
But nobody came!

419
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
There were no people.

420
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,600
And then what happened?

421
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,000
Then, he got me an apartment in his building.

422
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But they mixed up the mail.

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,600
And I never got my immigration renewal papers.

424
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,900
So they deported me.

425
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,100
It's all his fault.

426
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,400
Him.

427
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,900
And the woman.

428
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,000
But they did not care.

429
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,100
They're totally indifferent.

430
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,900
All they do is mock me, 
just like they did the fat fellow.

431
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,700
All the time.

432
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,900
Mocking, mocking, 
mocking, mocking, mocking.

433
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,500
All the time!

434
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,100
Now it is Babu's turn to mock.

435
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,900
Finally I will have some justice.

436
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Send them away!

437
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,800
Send them all away!

438
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
Lock them up forever!

439
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,100
They are not human.

440
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,400
They are very bad!

441
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Very, very, very bad!

442
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,600
Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera 

443
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,700
and welcome to this 
special edition of Rivera Live.

444
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,600
Well, arguments in the 
Good Samaritan trial ended today.

445
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
The jury has been in deliberation 
for four and a half hours now.

446
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,400
Let's go live to Jane Wells 

447
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,200
who is in Latham, Massachusetts
covering this trial for us.

448
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,100
Jane -

449
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, 
the jury asked to see the video tape.

450
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,800
That's the one where they are overheard 

451
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,100
making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.

452
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,600
Yes, it's a very incriminating 
piece of evidence.

453
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,000
But I must tell you, Geraldo, 

454
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,300
this courtroom and 
everyone who has attended this trial 

455
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,100
is still reeling 
from the endless parade of witnesses 

456
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,900
who have come forth so enthusiastically 
to testify 

457
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,400
against these four 
seemingly ordinary people.

458
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,600
One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay 
didn't finally put a stop to it, 

459
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,500
it could've gone on for months.

460
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Jane, whose testimony do you think 
resonated most strongly with this jury?

461
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,900
That is so hard to say.

462
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,600
Certainly there's the doctor 
with the poisoned invitations.

463
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,300
The Bubble Boy was an extremely 
sympathetic and tragic figure.

464
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,900
And that bizarre contest 

465
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,300
certainly didn't sit well 
with this small town jury.

466
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,600
There's the woman 
they sold the defective wheelchair to, 

467
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,700
the deported Pakistani restaurateur.

468
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Geraldo, it just went on, 
and on, and on, into the night.

469
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,300
And so we wait.

470
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,100
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?

471
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,300
I think so.

472
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,600
It's not that bright orange one, is it?

473
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I hope it's not that one, 
because I cannot wear orange.

474
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,700
Will you stop worrying?

475
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,900
Jackie's going to get us off.

476
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,300
He never loses.

477
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,300
How about when he asked that cop 
if a black man had ever been to his house.

478
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Did you see the look on his face?

479
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Sorry to bother you, Judge.

480
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,900
How did you get in here?

481
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Please, if he's found guilty, 
please be kind to him.

482
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,900
He's a good boy.

483
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,100
This is highly irregular.

484
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,600
Well, maybe there's something 
I can do for you.

485
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,100
What do you mean?

486
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,100
You know...

487
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.

488
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
We have plenty of time, too.

489
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,100
This jury could be out for days.

490
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,100
Hello?

491
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,100
Damn.

492
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
They're ready.

493
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,500
Hey Elaine--

494
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,700
what was it 
you were about to say to me 

495
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,600
on the plane when it was going down?

496
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,400
I've always loved U...

497
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,400
...nited Airlines.

498
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,100
I think it's going to be okay - 
that girl just smiled at me.

499
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Maybe because she knows 
you're going to jail.

500
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
All rise.

501
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, 
have you reached a verdict?

502
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,600
We have, Your Honor.

503
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Will the defendants please rise.

504
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,200
And how do you find with respect to 
the charge of criminal indifference?

505
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,700
We find the defendants - 

506
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,700
guilty.

507
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Order!

508
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Order in this court, 
I will clear this room!

509
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,900
I do not know how or 
under what circumstances 

510
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,800
the four of you found each other, 

511
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,200
but your callous indifference 

512
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,200
and utter disregard for 
everything that is good and decent 

513
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,800
has rocked the very foundation 
upon which our society is built.

514
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,600
I can think of nothing more fitting 

515
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,600
than for the four of you 
to spend a year removed from society 

516
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,200
so that you can contemplate 

517
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
the manner in which you 
have conducted yourselves.

518
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,000
I know I will.

519
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This court is adjourned.

520
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,300
You had to hop!

521
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,000
You had to hop on the plane.

522
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,800
Puddy--

523
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
don't wait for me.

524
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,400
Alright.

525
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,900
We gotta get out of here.

526
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,400
We want to beat the traffic.

527
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Come on, Jackie.
Let's go.

528
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,200
What?

529
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Oh, and by the way, they're real, 
and they're spectacular.

530
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,900
Well, it's only a year.

531
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,500
That's not so bad.

532
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,800
We'll be out in a year, 
and then we'll be back.

533
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,000
Could be fun.

534
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,400
Don't have to worry about your meals, 
or what you're going to do Saturday night.

535
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,500
And they do shows.

536
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,100
Yeah, we could put on a show - 

537
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,500
maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady".

538
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,900
Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.

539
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Why don't you just blow it out your...

540
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,400
If I call Jill from prison, 
do you think that would make up for the other ones?

541
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,300
Sure.

542
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,700
Cause you only get one call.

543
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,300
The prison call is like the king of calls.

544
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,300
I think that would be a very nice gesture.

545
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,100
I got it - it's out!

546
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,000
How about that, huh?

547
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh, boy, what a relief.

548
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
See now, to me, 
that button is in the worst possible spot.

549
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,000
Really?

550
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh yeah.

551
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,300
The second button is the key button.

552
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,400
It literally makes or breaks the shirt.

553
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Look at it, it's too high. 
It's in no-man's land.

554
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,800
Haven't we had this conversation before?

555
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,900
You think?

556
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,800
I think we have.

557
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Yeah, maybe we have.

558
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,500
So what is the deal with the yard?

559
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,800
I mean when I was a kid, 
my mother wanted me to play in the yard.

560
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,600
But of course she 
didn't have to worry about 

561
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,600
my next door neighbor Tommy 
sticking a shiv in my thigh.

562
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
And what's with the lockdown?

563
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Why do we have to be locked in our cells?

564
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,000
Are we that bad that we have to 
be sent to prison, in prison?

565
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You would think the weightlifting 
and the sodomy is enough.

566
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,300
So, anyone from Cellblock D?

567
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,200
I am.

568
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,600
I'll talk slower.

569
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D.

570
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
My friend George is in Cellblock D.

571
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,200
What are you in for, sir?

572
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,100
Murder one.

573
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,700
Murder one?

574
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,800
Oooooo, watch out everybody.

575
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,600
Better be nice to you.

576
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,500
I'm only kidding sir - lighten up.

577
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
How about you, what are you in for?

578
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Grand theft auto.

579
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,800
Grand theft auto - 
don't steal any of my jokes.

580
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,400
You suck - I'm gonna cut you.

581
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,300
Hey, I don't come down 
to where you work 

582
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,200
and knock the license plate 
out of your hand.

583
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,900
Alright, Seinfeld, that's it.
Let's go.

584
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,300
Come on.

585
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,900
Alright, hey, you've been great!

586
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,900
See you in the cafeteria.
