1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,800
I just think, if you borrow my blender, 
you should return it.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,400
Why, what's the difference?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,100
Come on. We're like Cain and Abel.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,400
You know, Cain slew Abel.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
He didn't. They were in business together. 
Drywalling or something.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,200
All right, then what was it?

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Well, I think Abel worked hard all summer, 
harvesting his crops,

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,900
while Cain just played in the field.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,800
Then when winter came, Abel had all the nuts. 

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,600
Cain had no nuts. So he killed him.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,000
The way I remember it, 
Cain was a successful doctor,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but when he took this special formula, 
he became Mr Abel.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,200
You broke my blender, didn't you?

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Yeah. When I was trying to make gravel. 
It just didn't work out.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Why were you making gravel?

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Well ... I like the sound it makes 
when you walk on it.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,500
This looks familiar.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,100
Of course. It's garbage.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,900
No, no, no, no. These brown things. 
The chairs. 

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,700
Jerry, this is the set 
from the old Merv Griffin Show! 

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,500
They must be throwing it out. 

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Yeah, at least in the dumpster 
behind the Smithsonian.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,700
Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on you 

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,100
and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,500
Come on, Kramer, get out of there.

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,300
No, no, no. You go on ahead. 
I'm not finished taking this in.

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,400
Oh, Jerry, look!

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Merv Griffin's cigar!

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,000
You know, I spilled a yohgurt smoothie 
in here two days ago. 

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
Can't smell anything, can y'a?

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Banana?

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,900
Right.

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
George watch out for those pigeons.

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Oh they'll get out of the way. 
You really smell banana?

36
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh my God. Oh.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,800
So, uh--

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
where are we eating?

39
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,400
And it was his idea to put 
a sprig of parsley on the plate.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,400
You're making this up. 
There was never a Joseph Garnish.

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,700
Wow!

42
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,600
Oh yeah the toys.

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,200
Where did you get all these?

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,800
My dad was a collector. 

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,300
I inherited them after he died 
from a long and painful bout ...

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,200
Super bowl! 

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Hey, an original G. I. Joe. 

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,400
With the full frogman suit.

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,700
Jerry, what are you doing?

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm putting this on him 
and we're going to the sink.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
No, Jerry! 

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,600
They're priceless. 
They've never been played with.

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,400
I just want to touch them a little.

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,400
I said no. Now come here.

55
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,600
Hi!

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, Walter, 
what is the deal with that guy?

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,900
Oh, he's Lou Filerman. 
He's new here. 

59
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey, your coffee stain 
looks like Fidel Castro.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,800
You've been an enormous help.

61
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
You ran over some pigeons? 
How many?

62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Whatever they had. 

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
Miranda thinks I'm a butcher. 
But it's not my fault is it? 

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,800
Of course we have a deal. 

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
They get out of the way of our cars, 

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
we look the other way 
on the statue defecation.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
Right! 
And these pigeons broke the deal. 

69
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,100
I will not accept the blame for this.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,500
So Miranda's cooled on ya?

71
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,700
I'm getting nothing.

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,100
Yeah, me neither.

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,600
Really? 
I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,500
Oh, the sex is wild,

75
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
but she's got this incredible toy collection 
and she won't let me near it!

76
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,700
I don't understand women.

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,600
Here comes one.

78
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey. What's going on?

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Hey.

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Art Garfunkle?

81
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
No, Castro.

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,700
Right.

83
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,400
All because of 
this creepy new guy at work.

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,600
He just comes out of nowhere 
and he's right next to you!

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
So he just sidles up?

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,200
That's right! He's a real sidler.

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,500
Maybe you didn't see him.

88
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,100
You never see him. 

89
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,000
He sidled me again in my office. 

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I was sitting there making a cup of soup, 
singing that song from "The Lion King".

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,100
Hakuna Matata?

92
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,200
I thought I was alone.

93
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
That doesn't make it right.

94
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,500
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata 
is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...

95
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,200
Would you just let it go?

96
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! 

97
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
Hey!

98
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,300
Oh my God!

99
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,300
It's the Merv Griffin set.

100
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,200
How did you get this in here?

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it.

102
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,900
So where are you gonna sleep?

103
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,600
Yeah ... backstage.

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,400
Phew! This chair smells like garbage.

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,300
Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - 

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,300
they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV.

107
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,500
Take Mannix for example.

108
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,100
I'm gonna get that.

109
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,100
All right. Well, Jerry, 
we'd love to have you back anytime.

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Well, Elaine Benes!

111
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,700
Well, it's great to have you! 

112
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Why, is it possible that you are even more beautiful 
than the last time I saw you?

113
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,600
We had a deal!

114
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,500
Mr. Peterman, 
here are these pages that you wanted.

115
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
One moment!

116
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm reading the most fascinating article 
on the most fascinating people of the year. 

117
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,800
And - done. 

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly. 

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
It must have been an awful lot of work. 

120
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
Thank you very much, you two.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,200
What?

122
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,700
So, three dates, and she still won't 
let me play with her toys.

123
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,100
That's interesting. 

124
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,900
You know, someone mentioned to me 

125
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,300
you were not very happy with your toys growing up?

126
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,200
Yeah, that was me.

127
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Oh, that's right, right, right. 

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
And you mentioned that you didn't get a G.I. Joe. 

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,900
You had -

130
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,600
An Army Pete.

131
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Right.

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,100
He was made of wood,

133
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,500
and in the rain 
he would swell up and then split.

134
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
And we all know how painful that can be.

135
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,700
Jerry?

136
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, Elaine Benes!

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. 

138
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Come on sit down. Yes.

139
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,500
Well, I'll tell you, 
this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,700
Excuse me.

141
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,800
We're talking this way.

142
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,500
Well, he's getting credit for work I did! 

143
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,800
He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.

144
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Now, for those of us who don't know, 

145
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,500
uh, sidling is what?

146
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,800
Kramer, what is wrong with you?

147
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,100
What do you mean?

148
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, for starters, 
you're looking at note cards.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,400
I'm gonna have to give that guy 
a taste of his own medicine. 

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,700
So I am going to sidle the sidler.

151
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,800
You, sidle? 

152
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
You stomp around like a Clydesdale!

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,100
Not with these honeys. 

154
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,200
Wrestling shoes!

155
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Only in New York!

156
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,300
Jerry?

157
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,200
Oh! 

158
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Well, ladies and gentlemen! 

159
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
It's our good friend, George Costanza! 

160
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
What a surprise!

161
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,700


162
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Yeah, sit, sit, sit.. Weeell!

163
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,700
Well, it happened again.

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,300
What happened?

165
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,200
Tut tut, I'll ask the questions. 

166
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,800
What happened?

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,100
Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. 

168
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
They - they didn't move.

169
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,000
All right, let's change the subject. 

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,300
Now, you and Jerry dated for a while. 

171
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Tell us... what was that like? 

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,500
That was the wrong card.

173
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
I don't get these birds! 

174
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
They're breaking the deal. 

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
It's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!

176
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
So they're like everyone else.

177
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,300
 All right, let's take a short break. 

178
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Okay! We're back!

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,100
Boy, that bank clock is eight minutes off.

180
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Then why don't you just run IT over too?

181
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Zing.

182
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,700
George, what are you doing?

183
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,400
Did you see that? 

184
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,600
That-that pigeon didn't move! 

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
I had to swerve to get out of the way! 

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
I saved that pigeon's life!

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,600
What pigeon? 
You drove right onto that squirrel! 

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Squirrel? 

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, we have no deal with !

190
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,700
Jerry! 

191
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,200
Those hands! They never stop!

192
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm sorry. 

193
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
You got any booze?
Let's say you and I get ripped!

194
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,500
No, thanks. 

195
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I have a headache. 
Can you just get me an aspirin?

196
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
All right.

197
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Ah. "Will not cause drowsiness."

198
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,300
"May cause drowsiness."

199
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
Here's the new copy you wanted.

200
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,500
Ah, yes. 

201
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,900
Well, this certainly looks like a lot of words. 

202
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,500
In record time. I'm very impressed ...

203
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,500
with both of you.

204
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,200
 Thank you.

205
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,100
Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. 

206
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,400
This is incoherent dribble! 

207
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,400
This is a total redo,
and I'm assuming I need it right away.

208
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Well, I guess we'll just have...  

209
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,900
All right, just gimme that.

210
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe.

211
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,900
Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?

212
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,400
There's been massive trauma. 

213
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400
We could of course try to save him,
but it would be costly, difficult,

214
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
and we'd have to send away 
for some special, really tiny instruments.

215
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,100
Well, uh, are there any other options?

216
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,200
We could put him to sleep.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,100
What might that cost?

218
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,800
Well, it's by the pound, so - 
about 80 cents.

219
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,600
Well?  

220
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,300
I was just - I'm curious, that's all. 

221
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,100
We - we'd like you to do everything possible.

222
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,600
He... he's not going to be the same, you know?

223
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

224
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,300
So they're flying the tiny instruments in 
from El Paso.

225
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,300
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.

226
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,800
El Paso!

227
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
What's he here for?

228
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,900
To take some of the pressure off of me. 

229
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,900
So, Jerry, what's going on with you? 
I understand there's a young lady in your life?

230
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,600
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story,
because she has this amazing toy collection 

231
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
and last night I finally got to play with them.

232
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,300
Well. 
It sounds like things are progressing. 

233
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,600
Do I hear wedding bells?

234
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Are you married right now?
- Newman!

235
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,900
Actually she doesn't even know 
about the toys. 

236
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,900
I gave her the wrong kind of medicine, 
and I guess she passed out!

237
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,300
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?

238
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,500
She's even got 
that old Mattel football game that we love!

239
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,300
Wait a minute, wait a minute! 

241
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,300
You mean to say that you drugged a woman
so you could take advantage of her toys? 

242
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Let's pause a moment. 

243
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,100
Jerry, now, what you do 
with your personal life is your business, 

244
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
but when you're on my set -
you clean it up, mister!

245
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,500
I told you he was a risk.

246
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh, like he's not just carrying you!
And has been for years!

247
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,300
Yeah? Well, you bombed! 
That story stunk worse than these chairs!

248
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Smile, everyone! 
We're back!

249
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,800
You wanted to see me, Elaine?

250
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
Yes, Lou. 

251
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,100
You've got a lot going for you. 
You're, ... um ... you're spontaneous. 

252
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You're symmetrical. 
You're...

253
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
You're very quick, aren't ya?

254
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,900
It's just that your...

255
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,500
My dead tooth?

256
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,500
No. Your - 

257
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,300
My breath?

258
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Ugh.

259
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,400
What can I do?

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Well, you should never ever go anywhere -

261
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
without these. 

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thanks, Elaine. 
You're such a super lady! 

263
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,800
More wine and turkey? 

264
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
So when I saw George on the street 
with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, 

265
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,500
I thought, what a coincidence. 
We're just about to eat.

266
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
What is that stuff in turkey 
that makes you sleepy?

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Triptophan.

268
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,900
... I think.

269
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,100
Have some more wine.

270
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
What video did you get?

271
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Oh, George brought 
home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.

272
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,000
Four hours.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
More heavy gravy?

274
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900
 Yes! Touch down! 

275
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Your turn, Jerry.

276
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Lately though, I've been buying 
the generic brand of waxed beans.

277
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I rip of the label. 
I can hardly tell the difference.

278
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Well, we've officially bottomed out. 
Who's our next guest?

279
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,300
We've got no one!

280
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,300
We need a new format. 
We should shut down and re-tool.

281
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,000
What about a guest-host?

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

283
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,000
Doctor, how's the squirrel?

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,300
Is he dead?

285
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,800
No. 

286
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,600
Fortunately, the special tiny instruments 
arrived just in time. 

287
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,700
Would you like to visit him?

288
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Yes he would.

289
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,900
You have 30 minutes. 

290
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
So, uh...

291
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,000
squirrel...

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
One more thing, Mister Costanza.

293
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
We just need to know 
what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.

294
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
What's that?

295
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. 
We think he'll be better off at home.

296
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,700
He has no home. 
He's a squirrel.

297
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,900
Your home, Mister Costanza. 

298
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Just make sure he gets his medicine 6x a day 
and keep his tail elevated. 

299
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,900
Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.

300
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,600
It's not a pet! 
It's a wild invalid! 

301
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,700
And it knows that I tried to kill it. 

302
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,700
As soon as it gets better, 
it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Jerry, what are you doing tomorrow? 
I want you to come by the set.

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,900
What about my "questionable material"?

305
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,200
Nope, we got a whole new format. 

306
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,600
Edgy, youthful, 
plus we got Jim Fowler!

307
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Jim Fowler? 

308
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,100
The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" 
is coming to your apartment?

309
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,900
Well, I practically raised his kids.

310
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,800
That's perfect! 
He's a zoo guy! 

311
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
He take's care of animals. 
Can I bring the squirrel by?

312
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
What? 
Two animal acts on the same show? 

313
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,500
What is this, amateur hour? 

314
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,300
Look, George, I'm sorry, but 
maybe another time, all right? 

315
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,500
I gotta get to Fowler. 

316
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,000
I know he would take this squirrel off my hands. 
It's practically bionic!

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,500
Hey! 

318
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,100
Nice sidle, huh? 

319
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,500
Speaking of which, 
I think I've got that problem solved.

320
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,700
Tic-tacs worked?

321
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,200
He's a human maraca.

322
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,700
Boy, my knuckles are still cramped 
from that football game.

323
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,900
You took him over to Celia's?

324
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,300
What? 
It's a victimless crime.

325
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,200
What about the woman 
who's been drugged and taken advantage of?

326
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,600
Okay, one victim.

327
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
I think it's unconscionable.

328
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,900
Last night I found a whole Weeble Village 
right behind the EZ Bake oven.

329
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,700
EZ Bake oven?

330
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,900
Who wants cupcake?

331
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,500
Oh, me, me, me, me, me!

332
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,900
You know, that batter is 
like 30 years old.

333
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900


334
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,600
Why is your father giving 
a tour of a rest stop?

335
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800


336
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh, don't look. 
This is the part where they change me.

337
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,700
You're like eight years old.

338
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,400


339
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I was seven and a half.

340
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,100
That noise. 

341
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,600
That's the noise!

342
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,100
What?

343
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,700
That infernal rattling sound 
that has plagued me these past two days.

344
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,800
And I could not find the source. 

345
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,800
In my office, in the hallway. 
Even in the men's room! 

346
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,600
Shame on you, Elaine!

347
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
No, no, Mr Peterman, 
that wasn't me!

348
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,600
That reminds me of 
the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! 

349
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,000
You haven't gone over to their side have you?

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,500
No, Mr Peterman.

351
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,800
Because, if I hear one more rattle - 
just one - 

352
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,600
you're out on your can. 

353
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,900
And if you are undead -

354
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,900
I'll find out about that too. 

355
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,800
Lou! In here! 

356
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,900
We have to talk.

357
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
Oh, right.

358
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,300
 No, stop it! 
Bad voodoo. 

359
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,700
You gotta stop using these.

360
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,900
Why?

361
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,200
Because they're turning your teeth green?

362
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,500
I only buy the white ones.

363
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Okay ... 

364
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,200
Well, then your teeth are green 
for a different reason. 

365
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,400
Just stop carrying these, okay?

366
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,800
Just use mouth wash.

367
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,300
I can't. It burns my cankers.

368
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,400
Binacca?

369
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,100
Again.

370
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,700
Right, right, cankers. 

371
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,500
Um, I got it! Chew gum!

372
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,600
I hate gum. 

373
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,400
The only gum I ever liked 
came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. 

374
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,300
They stopped making that 20 years ago.

375
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.

376
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Okay. A little later, 
we're gonna be talking with animal expert Jim Fowler.

377
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,300
Where are the cameras?

378
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
But first, we're talking with...

379
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,900
Jerry. 

380
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Okay, Jerry, uh, you drugged a woman 
in order to play with her toy collection. 

381
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,700
How do you feel about that?

382
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,900
It was great! 
I've done it a few more time since then.

383
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,300
And she doesn't know anything about this?

384
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,800
No, not a thing.

385
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:41,900
laughs

386
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Well, Jerry, 
we have a little surprise for you! 

387
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,400
Come on out, Celia!

388
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?

389
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,100
Wow!

390
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
What is this? 
What is she doing here?

391
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,100
It's the new format. 
Scandals and Animals.

392
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,700
If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, 
you got another thing coming, buddy!

393
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,200
Go girl!

394
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,900
Well, what kind of woman 
drinks an entire box of wine?

395
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
Ohhh!

396
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,600
Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here 
that is a miracle of modern science!

397
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
George, I told you we're booked!

398
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Careful. 
Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.

399
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,700
Ohhh. 
Another interesting confrontation. 

400
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,100
This could be spicy. 
Yeah, George, bring him over.

401
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,100
No, you idiot! 
Hawks eat squirrels!

402
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Are we getting this?

403
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,700
So the whole set was destroyed?

404
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,500
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying 
and the hawk kept clawing.

405
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,400
Well, at least we know 
the prosthetic squirrel hips work.

406
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Sorry about the set.

407
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,700
I tell you, it was a grind
having to fill 10 hours a day. 

408
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm not sure I was ready 
to have my own talk show set.

409
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,500
I got the nut bread, George. 
Let's go. 

410
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,000
So the squirrel's gonna make it?

411
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, he's in my bed. 
I'm sleeping on the couch.

412
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,100
On the couch? 
So you're...

413
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Still getting nothing!

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Go ahead, pigeons. 
Laugh it up. 

415
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,500
I'm getting in my car now, 
and the last I heard... 

416
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
we have no deal!

417
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm glad you called, Elaine. 
I really needed to talk to someone.

418
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Hey, I dated Jerry too. 
I know what a monster he can be. 

419
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,000
More wine and turkey?

420
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Who's he? 

421
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,900
Oh, he's nobody. 

422
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Hey, listen, 
let me top that off for you.
