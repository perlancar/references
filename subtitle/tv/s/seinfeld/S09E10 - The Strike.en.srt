1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
So, Whatley's still Jewish, huh?

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,400
Oh, sure. 
Without the parents, it's a breeze.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,100
Hey! 
Happy Chanukah!

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,100
Hey, Tim. 
Great party.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,800
Hey, George, thanks again for 
getting me those Yankee tickets.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,200
Oh, yeah. 
Still in good with the ground crew. 

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,300
That's good. 
Look, I'd better circulate.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,600
Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! 

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,100
This place is like 
Studio 54 with a menorah.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,300
I'm gonna get some more 
of these kosher cocktail franks.. 

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Oh,  I got denim vest checking me out. 

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,600
Fake phone number's coming out tonight.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
You have a standard fake?

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,300
M-hm.

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,100
Spells out N-O-E-L-A-I-N-E.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,700
Isn't that eight letters?

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,700
The extra E is for 'Echhh'.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,600
That's neat.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
No, please! Denim vest! 

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,800
He's smoothing it! 

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,700
Jerry! God! 

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,600
Hi!

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,100
Hi, I'm Jerry.
- Hi.

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,100
You might not know it to look at me, 
but I can run really, really fast.

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,900
Nice vest. 
I like the... big metal buttons.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
They're snaps. 

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,800
Listen, maybe we should, uh, 
go out some time?

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Why don't I give you my phone number?

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,800
How'd it go with that girl?`

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Great. I'm going out with her tomorrow night.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,900
How'd it go with the cocktail franks?

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,500
Great! I ate the entire platter! 
Had to call in sick today.

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
Didn't you call in sick yesterday?

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing.
"We don't care, and it shows."

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,400
You're gonna open your mail here?

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,600
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. 

37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,700
"Have you seen me?" Nope. 

38
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,300
Woah, something from Whatley.

39
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,300
See? You give, and you get.
This is what I'm trying to teach you.

40
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,700
"This holiday season, a donation 
has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."

41
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Oh, that's nice.

42
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,700
I got him Yankees tickets! He got me a piece of paper 
saying "I've given your gift to someone else"!

43
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,300
To a children's charity!

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,800
Don't you see how wrong that is?
Where's your Christmas spirit? 

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,300
And eye for an eye!

46
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,900
Don't give me anything this year.

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,600
Hey!

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,700
Hey.

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,300
Oh, nothing for me. 

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
"Atomic Sub"? 
Why are you eating there?

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,300
I got a card, 
and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,000
24 stamps, and I become a submarine...

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
captain.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,700
What does that mean?

56
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Free sub.

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,900
What?

58
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,000
Nothing. 
It's a card from my dad.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,500
What is it? 

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,500
"Dear son, Happy Festivus." 
What is Festivus?

61
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,200
It's nothing, stop it..

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
When George was growing up..

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,800
Jerry, No!

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,100
His father..
- No!

65
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,100
... hated all the commercial and religious aspects 
of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh... and another piece of the puzzle 
falls into place.

67
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,700
Alright..

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,400
And instead of a tree, 
didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
Jerry! Stop it!

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,200
And weren't there a feats of strength 
that always ended up with you crying?

71
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,200
I can't take it anymore! 
I'm going to work! Are you happy now?! 

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,300
Hey, neighbor. 

73
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,400
Are you reading my VCR manual?

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Well, we can't all be 
reading the classics, Professor Highbrow.

75
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Oh, I can't believe it! 
I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!

76
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number 
on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!

77
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,600
So?

78
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,500
I've eaten 23 bad subs, 
I just need 1 more! 

79
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,300
It's like a long, bad movie, 
but you want to see the end of it!

80
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
No, you walk out.

81
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,800
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, 
but you gotta finish it.

82
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,000
No, you wait for the movie!

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,300
I want that free sub.

84
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,700
You don't need the card. 

85
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,100
High-end hoagie outfit like that, 
it's all computerized!  

86
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,800
Technology! They're cloning sheep now.

87
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,000
No, they're not cloning sheep. 
It's the same sheep! 

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,700
I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick 

89
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,700
with two goats and a handkerchief 
on the old Dean Martin show!

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I gotta get ahold of Denim Vest!

91
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number 
and see if he's called it?

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
That's a good idea.

93
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,500
Yeah, Go! 

94
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. 

95
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. 
I'm going back to work.

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,200
What strike?

97
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,100
Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.

98
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,700
You?

99
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,400
Worked?

100
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,700
Bagels?

101
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. 

102
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,700
Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.

103
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,400
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, 
but I haven't seen them in a long time.

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us 
use their bath room while we were picketing. 

105
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,300
It put a cramp on our solidarity.

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
What were your... demands?

107
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,700
Yeah, $5.35 an hour. 
And that's what they're paying now.

108
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
I believe that's the new minimum wage.

109
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,500
Now you know who to thank for that!

110
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,800
Alright, I've got to go. 

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Why didn't you ever mention this?

112
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Jerry, I didn't want you to know 
I was out of work. It's embarrassing!  

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
All right, everybody! I'm back!

114
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
Who are you?

115
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,900
Cosmo Kramer? Strike's over.

116
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Oh yeah! Kramer.

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,000
Huh.. wha- 
Didn't any of the other guys come back?

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, I'm sure they all got other jobs 
like ten years ago.

119
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Man. 
Makes you wonder what it was all for.

120
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,900
I could use someone for the holidays...

121
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,900
Alright! 
Toss me an apron, let's bagel! 

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,200
What are those?

123
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,700
Those are raisin bagels.

124
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,000
I never thought I'd live to see that..

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So, anyway, I've been giving out 
your phone number as my standard fake.

126
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,400
So. You're Elaine Benes. 
We've been getting calls for you for 5 years.

127
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,300
So, listen, when this guy calls, 
if you could just give him my real number..

128
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,200
Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. 
Elaine Benes.

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Elaine Benes?!

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
You make a lot of man friends. 

131
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,200
You know who's a man? 
Charlie here, he's a man. 

132
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,400
You know who else? 
Me. I'm a man.

133
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm a man.

134
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Ohh.. my..

135
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,500
I'll have this best guy call your real number. 

136
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,500
You just, uh, give it to me. 
And that way, I'll have it. 

137
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,400
My number? Ohh.. 

138
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. 

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,700
And, uh, tell you what...

140
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo 
in the third at Belmont.

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,900
Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Tim.

142
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,100
What's up?

143
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,700
Actually, I'm having dinner 
with a girl I met at your party.

144
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,200
Mazel Tov.

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Jerry.. hi.

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,500
Gwen?

147
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,200
Yeah.

148
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Really?
- Yeah!

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on, our table is ready.

150
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,300
So, attractive one day - 
not attractive the next?

151
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,700
Have you come across this?

152
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,500
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome. 
She's a two-face.

153
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,600
Like the Batman villain?

154
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,000
If that helps you..

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
So, if I ask her out again, 
I don't know who's showing up.

156
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,700
The good, the bad, or the ugly.

157
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Clint Eastwood!

158
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,900
Yeah.

159
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,200
Hey, check this out. 

160
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,000
I gotta give out Christmas presents 
to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. 

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,700
"A donation has been made in your name 
to the Human Fund." - What is that?

162
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,200
Made it up.

163
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,200
"The Human Fund. 
Money for people."

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
What do you think?

165
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
It has a certain understated stupidity.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,300
The Outlaw of Josey Whales!

167
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Yeah.

168
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!

169
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
How was your first day?

170
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,800
Oh, fantastic! 

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
It felt so good 
to get my hands back in that dough.

172
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
Your hands were in the dough?

173
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,600
No, I didn't make these bagels. 

174
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah, they're day-olds. 
The homeless won't even touch them. 

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Oh, we try to fool them 
by putting a few fresh ones on top, 

176
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
but they dig.. they, they test.

177
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,200
Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. 

178
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
Happy Festivus!

179
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,500
What's Festivus?

180
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
When George was growing up...
- No!

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,900
His father..
- Stop it! It's nothing. 

182
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,900
It's a stupid holiday my father invented. 
It doesn't exist!

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,400
Happy Festivus, Georgie.

184
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Frank invented a holiday? 
He's so prolific!

185
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,900
Kramer, listen, 
I got a little phone relay going.

186
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,900
So, if a guy calls H&H 
and he's looking for me, you take a message.

187
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,800
You're still trying to get that free sub?

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, 
and I have eaten a lot of crap 

189
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,900
to get to where I am today. 
And I am not throwing it all away now.

190
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,700
Is there a captain's hat involved in this?

191
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,900
Maybe.

192
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,700
Kramer, I got your message. 

193
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,300
I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! 
What is your interest?

194
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,200
Well, just tell me everything, huh?

195
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Many Christmases ago, 
I went to buy a doll for my son. 

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
I reach for the last one they had - 
but so did another man. 

197
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,700
As I rained blows opon him, 
I realized there had to be another way!

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,100
What happened to the doll?

199
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
It was destroyed. 

200
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,300
But out of that, a new holiday was born. 

201
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,400
"A Festivus for the rest of us!"

202
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,000
That musta been some kind of doll.

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
She was.

204
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,800
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! 

205
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.

206
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,700
Oh... thanks. 

207
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Phil, I loved those cigars! 
Incoming! 

208
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,400
Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir.
Merry Christmas! 

209
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Not if you could see our books.

210
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
What is this?

211
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
The Human Fund.

212
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,300
Whatever. 

213
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,900
Exactly. 

214
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
Erica!

215
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,300
And at the Festivus dinner, 
you gather your family around, 

216
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,300
and you tell them all the ways 
they have disappointed you over the past year.

217
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
And is there a tree?

218
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,300
No. Instead, there's a pole. 

219
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Requires no decoration. 
I find tinsel distracting.

220
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,600
Frank, this new holiday of yours 
is scratching me right where I itch.

221
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Let's do it then! 
Festivus is back! 

222
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,600
I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. 

223
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,400
Hello, Frank.

224
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,300
Hello, woman. 

225
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,800
Kramer! Kramer - 
any word from the vest?

226
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
No.  

227
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.

228
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. 
This is the holidays.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,400
But it's Festivus.
- What?

230
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,900
You know you're infringing 
on my right to celebrate new holidays..

231
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,300
That's not a right.

232
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,500
Well, it's going to be! 
Because I'm going back on strike. 

233
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,300
Come on Elaine.  

234
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,600
It's a walk out!

235
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
No, I got to stay here 
and wait for the call.

236
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
What? You're siding with management?!

237
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
No, I'm just..

238
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Scab! Scab! Scab!

239
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,600
Hey.

240
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Boy, am I glad to see you.

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
You were expecting someone else?

242
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
You never know.

243
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,900
You know, 
you might want to take the tunnel.

244
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,900
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? 
Chinese or Italian?

245
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,400
I could go either way.

246
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,400
You're telling me.

247
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,300
So, she was switching? 
Back and forth?

248
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,000
The whole time. 

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She was like a 3-D baseball card 
that changes depending on the angle.

250
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,200
So one minute she's pretty and at the plate,

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,300
and the next she's ugly 
and advancing the runners?

252
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,500
So what happened next?

253
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,400
Well, we stopped by here, and -

254
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Actually, the only place she always looked good 
was in that back booth over there.

255
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,900
So, just bring her here. 
This is all you really need.

256
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,200
I can't just keep bringing her 
to the coffee shop. 

257
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,400
I mean, what if things, you know, progress?

258
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,100
Lights out.

259
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,700
Alright, I'll give it a shot! 

260
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,000
I do really like this coffee shop. 

261
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,900
Nice cuff links, by the way.

262
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,300
Office Christmas gift. 
I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!

263
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.

264
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,700
I know. I cut the button off 
and poked a hole with a letter opener.

265
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Oh, that's classy.

266
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,600
Well, Happy Festivus.

267
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
What is that? Is that the pole?!

268
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,700
George, Festivus is your heritage - 
it's part of who you are.

269
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
That's why I hate it.

270
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,800
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house. 
Everyone's invited.

271
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,600
George, you're forgetting 
how much Festivus has meant to us all. 

272
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,300
I brought one of the casette tapes. 

273
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,100
Read that poem.

274
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,200
I can't read it. 
I need my glasses!

275
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,300
You don't need glasses, 
you're just weak! You're weak!

276
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,000
Leave him alone!

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Alright, George. 
It's time for the Festivus feats of strength.

278
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
No! No! Turn it off! 
No feats of strength! 

279
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,100
I hate Festivus!

280
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,200
We had some good times.

281
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,100
Hey.

282
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,400
Hi there. 
This is Kramer, and Frank.

283
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,100
Hi.

284
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,800
Hello.

285
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,700
So, you ready to go?

286
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Uh, why don't we stay here? 
The back booth just opened up. 

287
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Now this is a good looking booth.

288
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Protect Festivus! 
Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, 

289
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Lady, if you want a sandwich, 
I'll make you a sandwich.

290
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,500
I want the one that I earned. 

291
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,100
I'll get it. I'll get it! 

292
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,800
H&H, and Elaine.

293
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,700
Elaine, you should get out of there. 

294
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,800
I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. 
It's going down.

295
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,100
What did you do?

296
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,300
You've been warned.

297
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,100
Oh, hi! 

298
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,800
Hey, the steam valve's broke.

299
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,200
Can we still make bagels?

300
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,100
Sure. It's just a little steamy.

301
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Hey! 
How do you like your bagels now?

302
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,700
George, I got something for you. 

303
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm suppose to find a charity 
and throw some of the company's money at it. 

304
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
They all seem the same to me, 
so what's the difference? 

305
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,300
20 thousand dollars?

306
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Made out to the Human Fund. 

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, damn. 
I've locked myself out of my office again. 

308
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Alright. 
I'm going home.

309
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,300
Jerry, how many times 
do we have to come to this - place?

310
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Why? It's our place.

311
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,400
I just found a rubber band in my soup.

312
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Oh.. I know who's cooking today!

313
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
Hey! Surprise, surprise!

314
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,600
Hey, Georgie!

315
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
I think I'm just gonna go.

316
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll be here.

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,900
Hey, soup.

318
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
She didn't touch it.

319
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Ohh.. Paco!  

320
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Hey, take a look at this. 

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,700
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? 
You're not keeping this.

322
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,800
I don't know.

323
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,000
Excuse me?

324
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,500
I've been doing a lot of thinking. 
This might be my chance to start giving something back.

325
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,700
You want to give something back? 
Start with the 20 thousand dollars.

326
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm serious.

327
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,700
You're going to start your own charity?

328
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,900
I think I could be a philanthropist. 
A kick ass philanthropist! 

329
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
I would have all this money, 
and people would love me. 

330
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,100
Then they would come to me and beg! 

331
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
And if I felt like it, 
I would help them out. 

332
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,600
And then they would owe me big time!  

333
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
First thing I'm gonna need is a driver.

334
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
No bagels, no bagels...

335
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Kramer, the vest just called.

336
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,300
Yamahama! It's fright night!

337
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. 

338
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Listen, in 10 minutes, 
I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.

339
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,400
And?

340
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Free sub.

341
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I'll see ya.
- Yeah.

342
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,300
Kramer, Hi!

343
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,500
Oh, hello.

344
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,600
It's Gwen.. 
We met... at the coffee shop.

345
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,900
Ah-huh.

346
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm dating your friend Jerry.

347
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,600
I don't know who you really are, 
but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. 

348
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,400
You're much better looking - 
and like a foot taller.

349
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,400
That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! 
He's afraid of getting caught.

350
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,700
Oh, he's a tomcat.

351
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,400
Steve.

352
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,200
Hmm?

353
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
It's Elaine.

354
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,300
From Tim Whatley's party?

355
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,400
Yeah.

356
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,000
You look... different.

357
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,400
I see you're still sticking with the denim.  

358
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
Do you have that card that I gave you?

359
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Well, I had it back at my place, 
but I can't go there now.

360
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,800
I'll give it to you later
or something.

361
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,600
No, no, no. 
You give me your number.

362
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,100
Okay. Sure.  

363
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Do you have the mumps?

364
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
No.

365
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,100
Typhoid?

366
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,200
No.

367
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Yamahama!

368
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
A fake number! Blimey!

369
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,300
George, we've got a problem. 

370
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,300
There's a memo, here, from accounting, 
telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.

371
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,500
Well, there could be.

372
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,200
But there isn't.

373
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Well, I... 
I could give the money back. Here. 

374
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,400
George, I don't get it. 

375
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
If there's no Human Fund, 
those donation cards were fake. 

376
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,700
You better have a damn good reason 
why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.

377
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Well, sir, I - 
I gave out the fake card, because, um -

378
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't really celebrate Christmas. 

379
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I, um, I celebrate Festivus.

380
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,300
Vemonous?

381
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
Festivus, Sir. 

382
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,100
And, uh, I was afraid 
that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. 

383
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,600
They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!

384
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Are you making all this up, too?

385
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,400
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. 

386
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,100
And I could prove it - if I had to.

387
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Yeah, you probably should.

388
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,600
Happy Festivus!

389
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,100
George? This is a surprise.  

390
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,000
Who's the suit?

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.

392
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Have you seen the pole, Kruger?

393
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,500
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.

394
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,500
He's gonna see it.

395
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Happy Festivus! 

396
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,400
Yamahama!

397
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
I didn't have time to go home. 
What are you doing here?

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,300
Embracing my roots.

399
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,500
They nailed you on the 20 G's?

400
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,900
Busted cold.

401
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,700
It's made from aluminum. 
Very high strength-to-weight ratio.

402
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,700
I find your belief system fascinating.

403
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! 

404
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,200
Hello again, Miss Benes.

405
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600
What are you doing here?

406
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Damnedest thing... 
me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, 

407
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
and, uh, we got this bagel place..

408
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,800
I told them I was just about to see you... 
It's a Festivus miracle!

409
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Dinner's ready!

410
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Let's begin.

411
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,000
Dr.. Van Nostrand?
- Uh?

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
That's right.

413
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,700
Welcome, newcomers. 

414
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,700
The tradition of Festivus 
begins with the airing of grievances. 

415
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,100
I got a lot of problems with you people! 

416
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,500
Now you're gonna hear about it! 

417
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You, Kruger. 
My son tells me your company stinks!

418
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,800
Oh, God.

419
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,400
Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. 

420
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet 
if you had a hot date with a babe.. 

421
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I lost my train of thought.

422
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Jerry!

423
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,400
Gwen! How'd you know I was here?

424
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
Kramer told me.

425
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Another Festivus miracle!

426
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,500
I guess this is the ugly girl 
I've been hearing about.

427
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. 
Give me a break.

428
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Gwen. Gwen, wait! 

429
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,100
Bad lighting on the porch.

430
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,700
Hey, how'd my horse do?

431
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,700
He had to be shot.

432
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,300
And now as Festivus rolls on, 
we come to the feats of strength.

433
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,000
Not the feats of strength..

434
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,300
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.

435
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,200
Uh-oh. 
Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. 

436
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,300
I have to work a double shift at H&H.

437
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,700
I thought you were on strike?

438
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,100
Well, I caved. 
I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. 

439
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Frank, no offence, 
but this holiday is a little - out there.

440
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Kramer! You can't go! 
Who's gonna do the feats of strength?

441
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,400
How about George?

442
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,300
Good thinking, Kruger. 

443
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Until you pin me, 
George, Festivus is not over!

444
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,300
Oh, please, somebody, stop this!

445
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's rumble!

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,900
I think you can take him, Georgie!

447
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,800
Oh, come on! Be sensible.

448
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Stop crying and fight your father!

449
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Ow! Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
- This is the best Festivus ever!

450
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,900
Alright. That's enough. 
You're fired.

451
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Thank you.
