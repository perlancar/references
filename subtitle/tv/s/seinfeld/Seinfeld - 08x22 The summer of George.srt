1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,333
I can't believe the Yankees fired me.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,441
Well, you had a good run.
You took them to the World Series.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,410
I gotta give the players
most of the credit for that.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,577
Don't sell yourself short. You made
flight arrangements, hotels, buses.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,945
No, I don't know
who was doing that.

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,186
So when you actually did work,
what is it that you did?

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,417
I'll tell you, they had a pastry cart
you wouldn't believe.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,625
Here we go.

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,592
Your latte.

10
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,527
Your cappuccino.

11
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,233
Maybe I should ask her out.

12
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,262
-She is a good waitress.
-It's true.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,534
-Maybe I'll take her to the Tonys.
-You're going to the Tonys?

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,804
Yeah, I wrote some jokes for the show
and they gave me two tickets.

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,143
Why didn't you ask me?
I know a million theater jokes.

16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:54,912
What's the deal with those guys
down in the pit?

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,256
They're musicians.
That's not a joke.

18
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,155
It's a funny observation.

19
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,688
Severance package?

20
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,833
The Yankees are giving me three
months' full pay for doing nothing.

21
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,492
They did it for three years.
What's another few months?

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,900
I'm gonna do something
with these three months.

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,268
-Like what?
-I'm gonna read a book...

24
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,603
...from beginning to end,
in that order.

25
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,438
I've always wanted to do that.

26
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,978
-I'm going to play Frolf.
-You mean golf?

27
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:26,608
Frolf. Frisbee golf, Jerry.
Golf with a Frisbee.

28
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,918
This is gonna be my time.

29
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,889
Time to taste the fruits
and let the juices drip down my chin.

30
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,553
I proclaim this
"The Summer of George."

31
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,003
And then Peterman ate it.

32
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,009
I never told him.

33
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,777
-Who is that?
-That's Sam...

34
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,285
...the new girl in Accounting.

35
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,891
What's with her arms?
They just hang like salamis.

36
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,458
She walks like an orangutan.

37
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,527
Better call the zoo.

38
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,794
What?

39
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,265
Catty.

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,002
It's like she's carrying
invisible suitcases.

41
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,076
-Like this?
-Yes, exactly.

42
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,042
-That is so strange.
-Right.

43
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,114
So why am I the one who gets:

44
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,513
I mean, they were being
just as catty as I was.

45
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,516
It's a double standard.

46
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,646
Oh, and what about ladies' night?
Women admitted free before 1 0?

47
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,053
That is so stupid.

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,264
Hey, The White Shadow is on.

49
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,892
Boy, you're really packing it all in.

50
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,495
Jerry, my vacation has just started.
I need a day or two to decompress.

51
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,766
-Besides, I did plenty today.
-Like what?

52
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,604
I bought a new recliner
with a fridge built right into it.

53
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,438
Hey, Jerry, you got any TUMS?

54
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,947
-Stomachache?
-I drank too much water in the shower.

55
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,276
Top of the fridge.

56
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,345
Hey, George, I'm taking
that waitress to the Tonys.

57
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,321
-Shadow.
-Oh, the Tonys?

58
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,120
I'll see you there, buddy.

59
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,388
-You're going to the Tonys too?
-Roger that.

60
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,896
-Where are you sitting?
-Well, all over the place.

61
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,830
I'm a seat-filler. They don't like
to see empty seats on TV.

62
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,130
Somebody gets up, I park my caboose
in their spot until they get back.

63
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,672
-How did you get that job?
-Mickey, he hooked me up.

64
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,105
-Yeah, he's a member of the academy.
-What academy?

65
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,336
Well, he didn't say.

66
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,743
-Hi.
-Hi.

67
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,888
-Nice tuxedo.
-Thanks. It's a breakaway.

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,921
-Should we go?
-Absolutely.

69
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,288
-Lyle, we're going.
-All right.

70
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,826
Jerry, this is Lyle.

71
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,561
-Hey, how you doing?
-Okay.

72
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,098
Bye.

73
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,295
-Have a good time.
-Thanks...

74
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,765
...Lyle.

75
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,009
Are you leaving?
Because I got you covered.

76
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,011
I'll just go ahead and get in there.

77
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,248
Just a minute. What are you doing?

78
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,825
My job. What are you doing?

79
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:29,928
They catch the two of us on TV, you
might have a little explaining to do.

80
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,506
-So you and Lyle are roommates?
-No.

81
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,142
-Gay?
-What?

82
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,613
-ls he gay?
-No.

83
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,444
Are you sure?

84
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,121
I think I would know.

85
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,157
This is a new one.

86
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,595
Turkey jerky? Go ahead, take a pull.

87
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,293
More for me.

88
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:10,799
And the Tony for best musical
is awarded to Scarsdale Surprise.

89
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,877
Lewis Maxtone-Graham,
Douglas Ewing...

90
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,709
...Benjamin London,
Polly Kennedy, producers.

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,893
-Kramer?
-Thank you and bless you all.

92
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,062
This truly has been
a Scarsdale Surprise.

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,079
Elaine, am I crazy?

94
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,273
I just get the feeling that...

95
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,182
...Dugan and the others are
making fun of me all the time.

96
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:00,585
Well, you might wanna think
about maybe...

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,252
...moving your arms a little
when you walk.

98
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,761
My arms?

99
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,230
You know, sort of swing them...

100
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:14,271
...so you're not lurching around,
you know, like a caveman.

101
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,470
I'm a caveman?

102
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,104
No, no, no, it's just that--

103
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,874
Everyone told me
what a catty shrew you were.

104
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,415
You're horrible.

105
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,718
She had a dude?

106
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,121
When I went to pick her up,
there was this dude.

107
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,285
-How do you know it was her dude?
-lt could've been just some dude?

108
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,260
Dudes in this town
are a dime a dozen.

109
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,366
-I reckon.
-Or maybe...

110
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,502
...she just wanted to go
to the Tonys.

111
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,229
I tell you what. Ask her out again.
No Tony, just Jerry.

112
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,897
That way you know if the dude
is her dude or some dude.

113
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,509
-Dude.
-Yeah.

114
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,612
All right, that's enough.
I gotta go home and take a nap.

115
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,078
It's 1 0:30 in the morning.

116
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,308
What can I tell you, I'm wiped.

117
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,942
So has the Summer of George begun,
or are you still decomposing?

118
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,320
Decompressing.

119
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:11,194
Well, good morning, gentlemen,
and Tony says hello to you.

120
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,060
-You didn't give that thing back?
-Jerry, it was a whirlwind.

121
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,760
They whisk us backstage.
The media is swarming.

122
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,337
Champagne is flowing.

123
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,940
I can't describe
how great it is to win.

124
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,804
That's because you didn't win.

125
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,444
Scarsdale Surprise.

126
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,775
That's the musical about
the Scarsdale diet doctor murder.

127
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,943
Featuring the mind-blowing
performance of Miss Raquel Welch.

128
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,520
You haven't even seen it.

129
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,250
Oh, Jerry, I'm not gonna let you
bring me down off this high.

130
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,916
I've been partying all night.

131
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,153
I saw the sun rise at Liza's.

132
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,758
-Minnelli's?
-No.

133
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,795
Sam, listen. I am so sorry
about the other day.

134
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,305
No, don't apologize, Elaine.

135
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,344
I was thinking that maybe I should
swing my arms a little bit more.

136
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,813
See, yeah, I mean,
that's all I was saying.

137
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,780
How's this?

138
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,554
Or this? Or this?

139
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,557
-Or this? Or this?
-Well...

140
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,888
...you seem to be
getting the hang of it.

141
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,625
-Hi.
-Sorry, I'm running late.

142
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,635
-I just lost track of time.
-No rush.

143
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,902
Hey, Jerr, what's up?

144
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,872
I have absolutely no idea.

145
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,642
Can you believe she expected me
to squire her around town...

146
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,414
...while the dude sits at home
in swaddling clothes?

147
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,283
Do they make swaddling clothes
for adults?

148
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,927
It's like she's put the role
of boyfriend into two jobs.

149
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,892
Except the dude's playing
the showroom...

150
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,224
...and I'm stuck doing
food and beverage.

151
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,264
-Hey.
-Who's that?

152
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,868
-It's Kramer.
-Hey, Kramer.

153
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,904
-George says hi.
-Hi, George.

154
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,631
How's that Tony?

155
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,571
Why don't you just come over here?

156
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,473
Why can't I do this on the phone?

157
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,308
-What's Kramer doing now?
-He's looking in the refrigerator.

158
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,043
Kramer. Anything good in there?
Any Popsicles?

159
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,550
I cannot do this.

160
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,086
-So, what's George doing?
-He's not doing anything.

161
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,147
Goodbye.

162
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,924
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat at Sardi's.
You wanna go?

163
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,892
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?

164
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,033
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.

165
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,136
Oh, hello.

166
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,002
-Well, I'm going.
-Congratulations.

167
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,975
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

168
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,240
I have so many people I want to thank.
I don't want to forget anyone.

169
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,850
All right. All right.

170
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,148
I said no.

171
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,152
Jerry, I just want to let you know
Lyle and I are completely over.

172
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,795
I'd rather be with you.

173
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:01,764
Just me? No dudes or fellers?

174
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,630
-What do you think?
-I can start right away.

175
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,596
-But not here.
-I'm not here. Leave a message.

176
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,263
Jerry, what's happening?

177
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,434
Jerry, come on, pick up the phone.

178
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:18,181
So, I said to him,
"Arthur, Artie, bubele...

179
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,810
...why does the salesman have to die?
Change the title.

180
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,448
The Life of a Salesman.
That's what people want to see."

181
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,218
Excuse me, Mr. Kramer.

182
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,386
My name is Lewis Maxtone-Graham.

183
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,761
I'm one of the producers
of Scarsdale Surprise.

184
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,062
Oh, hey. Yeah. Lew!

185
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,966
We need to talk.

186
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,004
Elaine, what did you want
to talk to me about?

187
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,703
This. My office.

188
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,349
Sam trashed my office.

189
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,452
Well, I see what's going on here.

190
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,556
I am smack-dab in the middle
of a good old-fashioned catfight.

191
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,921
Mr. Peterman, this is not a catfight.

192
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:06,656
This is violent, psychotic behavior,
directed at me...

193
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,562
...all because I told her
to swing her arms.

194
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,571
Do you mean:

195
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,038
Yes, that's the one.
Good day, Elaine.

196
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,043
Oh, no, please, Mr. Peterman.
She's crazy.

197
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,074
Crazy for feeling

198
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:30,712
So lonely

199
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,684
I can't believe how much
we did this afternoon.

200
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,056
I have a friend,
today would be his whole life.

201
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,028
Now, what time are you
picking me up tonight?

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,259
You got reservations at Sfuzzi,
didn't you?

203
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,427
Oh, yeah, Sfuzzi. I gotta do that.

204
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,936
-Should I wear the outfit I bought?
-Sure.

205
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,975
-Which one?
-The one with the:

206
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,975
If I'm gonna get my hair cut,
I better go.

207
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,137
Call me when you get home.
I won't be there...

208
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,782
...but leave a message
so I know.

209
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,211
Okay. Okay.

210
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,017
-Do you mind?
-No, I'll grab them, yeah.

211
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,986
Hey. I've done that today.

212
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,358
-What? Did you lose your remote?
-No, cable's out.

213
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,022
-What's with you? You look dead.
-It's Lanette.

214
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,964
I need, like, an assistant
or an intern or something.

215
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,267
Relationship intern, huh?

216
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:27,845
Hey, what if the two of us
teamed up?

217
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,675
-Not...?
-No, no.

218
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,408
-No, because that's--
-No.

219
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,746
Listen, we're always sitting here.

220
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,478
I help you with your girl problems.

221
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,919
You help with my girl problems.
Where do we end up?

222
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,184
-Here.
-Exactly, because neither one of us...

223
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,952
...can handle a woman
by ourselves.

224
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,222
-I'm trying.
-I've tried.

225
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,694
We don't have it.

226
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:51,132
But maybe the two of us,
working together at full capacity...

227
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,272
...could do the job
of one normal man.

228
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,170
And each of us would only
have to be, like, a half-man.

229
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,845
That sounds about right.

230
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,879
We understand
how excited you are....

231
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,142
..to have this very,
very prestigious award.

232
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,344
But you didn't have anything to do
with the actual production.

233
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,955
No.

234
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,889
I'm afraid there is no way
we can allow you to keep this Tony.

235
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,391
-What?
-Unless--

236
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,793
-Anything.
-Are you familiar with our star...

237
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,025
-...Raquel Welch?
-She's fantastic.

238
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,669
She's a train wreck.

239
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,665
There's a big tap-dance number...

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,070
...before Jean Harris leaves
The Madeira School...

241
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,641
...to confront Dr. Tarnower.

242
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,041
-lt is a gut-wrenching scene.
-Yes.

243
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,008
But Raquel Welch doesn't move
her arms when she tap dances.

244
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,708
It's very distracting.

245
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,582
There is a lot of this...in tap dancing.

246
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,725
So you'd like me to teach her
how to dance?

247
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,554
No, we want you to fire her.

248
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,428
Why do they want you
to fire Raquel Welch?

249
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,300
Because they're terrified of her.

250
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,270
I heard they cut one of her lines.

251
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,569
She climbed up a rope
on the side of the stage...

252
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,508
...and started dropping lights
on people's heads.

253
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,740
A story like that's gotta be true.

254
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,843
She seems very nice.

255
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,577
Jerry, you're not in show business.

256
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,517
You don't know
what these people are like.

257
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,750
-I'm in show business.
-Oh, come on.

258
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,521
What am I going to do?
She's gonna eat me alive.

259
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,561
I got a tape of Fantastic Voyage,
if you think that'll help.

260
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,722
I'll take it.

261
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:34,568
Jerry, that crazy straight-arm woman
down at Peterman's trashed my office.

262
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,540
And then listen to this.
This is the message she left me.

263
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,442
Elaine, I am going to find you.

264
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,016
If not in your office,
then in the Xerox room...

265
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,710
...or the small conference room
next to the kitchen, or the kitchen.

266
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,790
I mean, she must have a blueprint
of the building or something.

267
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,392
-Did you tell Peterman about this?
-Well, I tried.

268
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,722
But he thought it was
some sort of a catfight.

269
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,387
Catfight?

270
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,530
Okay. Why? Why do guys do this?

271
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,670
What is so appealing to men
about a catfight?

272
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,396
Catfight.

273
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,974
Because men think if women are
grabbing and clawing at each other...

274
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,843
...there's a chance
they might somehow kiss.

275
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,719
-You got the tickets?
-Yeah.

276
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,084
Two for the 7:1 5
of Lenore's Promise.

277
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,919
What, are you wearing
a green sweater?

278
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,321
-I like it.
-Lanette doesn't.

279
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,224
Here's your blue one.
It's her favorite.

280
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,194
-What?
-Just put it on.

281
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,732
All right. Now, remember
she got her nails done today...

282
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,063
...so remark on
how you like the color.

283
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,263
And if you need me, you beep me.
All right?

284
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,135
Here, here. There you go.
There you go.

285
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,970
All right.

286
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,578
-Go get them. You're a tiger!
-Hey, George, one second.

287
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,613
She's having a party Friday.
She wants me to do the invitations.

288
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,183
A little notice would have helped.
How many people?

289
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,515
Thirty-five. And George,
on the invitations--

290
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,316
Yeah, I know. Don't skimp. Go, go.

291
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,621
Right on time. I like that.

292
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,354
I like your nails.
That is a great color.

293
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,727
-Love the sweater.
-This old thing?

294
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,235
Hi, I need some party invitations.

295
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,803
Okay. Have you been
in here before?

296
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,774
About a year ago.
Wedding invitations.

297
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,639
Right. How did that all work out?

298
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,344
No complaints.

299
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:29,986
Well, they're arranged according
to price, and as I recall....

300
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:35,252
Actually, I'll take these nice,
glossy ones.

301
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,592
You are a fraud, Dr. Tarnower.

302
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,989
You haven't even been
to Scarsdale.

303
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,398
-Miss Welch. Hi.
-Who are you?

304
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,105
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer.

305
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,332
I'm one of the producers.

306
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,209
Hello. Sidney.

307
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:59,648
No. No, I told you
I don't want to do that.

308
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,948
If you bring it up again,
I'll feed your genitals to a wolf.

309
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,982
Kids.

310
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,020
-You're still here?
-Well, Miss Welch...

311
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:14,257
...I do need to talk to you about a little
problem regarding your performance.

312
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,460
-What kind of problem?
-Well, it seems that...

313
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:21,299
...due to the vagaries
of the production parameters...

314
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,773
...vis-à-vis the fragmenting of
the audience, due to cable television...

315
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,538
-...carnivals, water parks--
-Out with it.

316
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,239
You're fired. You don't use your arms
when you tap dance.

317
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,112
You're like a gorilla. I gotta go.

318
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,022
A little help?

319
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,559
-Hey, Frolf?
-Yeah.

320
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,789
You know, we need a fourth
for the back nine. You want in?

321
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,732
What's the deal
with airplane peanuts?

322
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,173
-Yeah, sure.
-Come on.

323
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,400
Well, I'm ready.

324
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,603
Let's towel it up.

325
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,743
Jerry, where are those invitations
you were supposed to get?

326
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,317
If they don't go out today,
they're useless.

327
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,078
But we're in towels.

328
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,984
-Jerry.
-All right, one second.

329
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,920
He Frolfs...he scores!

330
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,369
-Hello.
-George, where are those invitations?

331
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,869
You were supposed to leave them
with her doorman.

332
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,838
-Did you shave your chest hair?
-No.

333
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,645
Did you at least pick them up?

334
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,282
Yeah, yeah, super glossy,
the best they had.

335
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,940
Well, get them over here pronto.

336
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,450
We're at towels here, George.

337
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,986
All right. All right.
Keep your towel on.

338
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,153
-What?
-It's a joke.

339
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,159
All right. That's not bad.
Now get over here.

340
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,064
--if not in your apartment,
then in the laundry room...

341
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,540
...or the ATM in the building
across the street...

342
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,872
...or the watch shop!

343
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,413
Can't you do anything about this?
I mean, this woman is a psycho.

344
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,845
Look, just because I'm a woman
doesn't mean--

345
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,026
I don't move my arms when I dance?

346
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,821
That's my signature.

347
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,656
Would you just keep an eye out
for this woman?

348
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,800
She's about, I don't know,
yay high...

349
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:33,165
...and she doesn't swing her arms
when she walks.

350
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,239
-What do you mean?
-Like this:

351
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,672
What the hell is that?
Are you making fun of my dancing?

352
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,207
Aren't you Raquel Welch?

353
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,547
You know who I am.
Now, what are you doing?

354
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,247
Nothing. I just wasn't
moving my arms.

355
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,553
That's it. You're going down.

356
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,454
Catfight.

357
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,527
So how's George?

358
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,863
I don't know.
They won't tell me anything.

359
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,369
What's that?

360
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,208
Tony.

361
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,868
-What happened to you?
-Raquel Welch.

362
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,119
-What happened to you?
-Raquel Welch.

363
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,546
-The woman is a menace.
-Yeah.

364
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,284
I bumped into her on the street.
It got pretty ugly.

365
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,692
A catfight with Raquel Welch.

366
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,801
My God, George.

367
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,602
I slipped on the invitations.

368
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,441
-How's the towels?
-They're back on the rack.

369
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,808
-Even with the two of us?
-I think we're still a man short.

370
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,579
Mr. Costanza...

371
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,481
...your legs have sustained
extensive trauma.

372
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,494
Apparently, your body was in
a state of advanced atrophy...

373
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,757
...due to a period
of extreme inactivity.

374
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,001
But with a lot of hard work
and a little bit of luck...

375
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,540
...I think there's a good chance
you may, one day, walk again.

376
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,044
Well, that's good news.

377
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,650
Wow, invitations again.

378
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,517
Yeah, that's weird.

379
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,117
All right. Well....

380
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,397
-You want to grab some coffee?
-Yeah, coffee.

381
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,624
-I'd like to get some coffee.
-Okay.

382
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,473
This was supposed to be
the Summer of George.

383
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,412
The Summer of George.

384
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,192
Summer of George.

385
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,797
-Swing them.
-Swing them.

386
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,593
-Right? Okay?
-Sort of swing.

387
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,872
Swing them.

388
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,705
Just swing them.

389
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:30,871
I can't do it. Okay? It's hard.

390
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,677
-Come on. Okay?
-Here we go.

391
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--

392
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,258
There's still a little summer left.
