1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,836
You know that manslaughter
is the least serious murder charge?

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,504
-You don't say.
-Manslaughter.

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,509
Literally, the slaughter of a man.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,341
-Sounds brutal, doesn't it?
-Heinous.

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,007
Yet it's the most socially acceptable
form of murder.

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,411
So you think we should
change the name.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:26,116
Yes, I do. How about
"inadvertent life-ending"?

8
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,426
"Unintentional snuff-out."

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,529
How about
"l can't believe it's not murder"?

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,063
Oh, boy, I was up till 4 in the morning
watching that Omen trilogy.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,765
-That's good stuff.
-The devil? Forget about it.

12
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,637
Well, he was the devil's son, right?

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,804
-I thought he was the devil's helper.
-He's pretty scary for a helper.

14
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,777
I can't keep doing this to myself.
I'm exhausted.

15
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,647
Can't you grab a nap at work?

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,619
Not with that big glass window
looking out onto the hall.

17
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,281
And I love a good nap.

18
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,019
Sometimes it's the only thing
getting me out of bed.

19
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,890
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,124
-So, what are you doing now?
-Gonna take a stroll through the park.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,733
With a gentleman caller?

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,234
Yes, his name is Hal.

23
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,168
The walking date's good.
You don't have to look at the person.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,399
Hey, it's the next best thing
to being alone.

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,838
-Hey, hi.
-Hi.

26
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,242
-Shower?
-Oh, pool.

27
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,275
I just swam 200 laps.

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,940
You are kidding.

29
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,810
Yeah, look at those babies, huh?
They're prunes.

30
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,979
You know, I saw Conrad
going up to your place.

31
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,320
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new
kitchen cabinets. How's that coming?

32
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,928
Slow. I gotta hold this guy's hand
on every decision.

33
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,258
Hey, Kramer, listen.
You've seen The Omen, right?

34
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,627
What exactly was that kid?

35
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,325
Oh, Damien?

36
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:47,940
Nothing, just a mischievous,
rambunctious kid.

37
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:54,142
George, have you seen
that American League directory?

38
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,441
It's a big green book.

39
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,915
-Right here.
-Thanks, kiddo.

40
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,394
You know Twinkies aren't cooked?

41
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,561
It looks cooked.
It's dark on the bottom.

42
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,866
That's just the way it is.
It's a substance.

43
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,009
Well, I don't care. They're delicious.

44
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,941
-You wanna sit down?
-Oh, I don't sit on park benches.

45
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,138
-They're very bad for the back.
-Really?

46
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,307
I threw my back out 1 5 years ago.
Ever since, I've been careful.

47
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,350
I buy my furniture
at an ergonomic store.

48
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,922
Oh, those places
have the stupidest names.

49
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,252
Like-- Like Back in Business...

50
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,986
...or Good Vertebrations.

51
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,859
Not this one.
It's called the Lumbar Yard.

52
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,600
Hey, Jerry.
Jerry, are you okay with this hinge?

53
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,638
-Yeah.
-I can get you any kind you want.

54
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,242
Four holes, two holes,
bronze, no hinge at all.

55
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,936
You know, why don't we just go
with the one in your hand?

56
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,573
-Well, these are different.
-Drop one.

57
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,508
Left.

58
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:13,021
Jerry, look at my eyes.

59
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,457
A little less beady today.

60
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,562
Because I'm refreshed.

61
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,597
I finally found a way
to sleep in my office.

62
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,291
Under the desk, huh?

63
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,232
I lie on my back, I tuck in the chair,
I'm invisible.

64
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,736
Sounds like a cool fort.

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,108
Hey, Jerry, do you want
a flat edge on this molding...

66
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,800
...or do you want me to bevel it?

67
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,209
-I'll tell you what I'd like to do with it.
-Hey, Conrad, is it?

68
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,941
Conrad, Connie or Con.
Whatever you prefer.

69
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,712
Let me ask you a question.

70
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,878
Could you expand
the space underneath a desk...

71
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,149
...you know, give it
a little more headroom?

72
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,293
George, he's kind of tied up here.

73
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,257
What? It would have to be
a night job.

74
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,761
-You normally work after dinner?
-There is no normal.

75
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,263
Whatever Jerry wants.
He wants me here late, I'm late.

76
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,423
He wants me early, I'm early.

77
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,730
You know, why don't you just work
on George's project for a while.

78
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,497
Whatever you want.

79
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,300
So how was Wednesday
in the park with Hal?

80
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,141
It was okay. He's coming over later
to watch a movie.

81
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,805
Hey, listen,
what's better for your back:

82
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,442
The couch cushions
or a folding chair?

83
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,282
I don't know.

84
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,349
Maybe we'll just stand
and watch the TV.

85
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,756
I gotta go. Somebody's at my door.

86
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,124
-Yeah?
-Delivery.

87
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,534
-Elaine Benes?
-Yeah.

88
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,695
We're from the Lumbar Yard.
Got your mattress.

89
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,967
Mattress?
I didn't order a mattress.

90
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,974
Who sent this?

91
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,347
"Hal Kitzmiller"?

92
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:51,614
You think it might be possible to add
a little shelf, like, for an alarm clock?

93
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,349
What, about maybe that big?

94
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,289
-I don't know, like this?
-Like that?

95
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,655
-Like that.
-I can do that.

96
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,296
Great.

97
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,826
You know, this could sound crazy...

98
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,732
...but what do you think about adding
a drawer for, like, a blanket?

99
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,870
-Blanket or a quilt?
-Blanket.

100
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,702
-About that thick?
-Maybe like this.

101
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,968
-Like that?
-Like that.

102
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,612
-lf that's what you want.
-That's what I want.

103
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,773
Hey, George, do you want
this cup holder--?

104
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,315
Want it mounted on the left,
the right, the middle?

105
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,248
Whatever.

106
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,159
This is unbelievable.

107
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,196
This is better than my bed at home.

108
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,357
All right. It's been a long night.

109
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,002
You go home and get some sleep.

110
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,832
-lf that's what you want.
-That's what I want.

111
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,475
-Morning, George.
-Morning, Mr. Wilhelm.

112
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,588
-I got pool problems, Jerry.
-What happened?

113
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,818
Well, I had been swimming
for three hours...

114
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,452
...and I was in a real groove,
so I decided to keep going.

115
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,826
But at 1 0, they start the aquacise.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,935
Thirty-five geriatrics
throwing elbows.

117
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,541
It was like I was swimming through
a flabby-armed spanking machine.

118
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,269
-Well, how long did that last?
-Half-hour. Then diving class started.

119
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,709
Well, that got a little messy.

120
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,941
I gotta find a new place to swim...

121
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,211
...because that pool
can't hold me, Jerry.

122
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,149
-How was the movie?
-I cancelled.

123
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,554
Hal sent a mattress
to my apartment.

124
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,921
-The nerve of that guy.
-Why?

125
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,892
He's got a back problem.

126
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,726
So you think he was expecting
a roll in the supportive hay?

127
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,895
After one date.

128
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,004
-What's that guy's last name again?
-Kitzmiller.

129
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,101
Oh, that's right.

130
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,138
What are you gonna do
with the mattress?

131
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,572
I don't know, chuck it?

132
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,440
Oh, wait, no, no, no. I'll take it.

133
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,809
Yeah, come over.
See if it'll fit in my bedroom.

134
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,417
-Oh, all right.
-Yeah, my old one sprung a leak.

135
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,348
-You have a waterbed?
-Sand.

136
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,148
It's like sleeping on a beach.

137
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,752
-Hey.
-Hi, Con.

138
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,449
Jerry, I'm sorry I'm late.

139
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,822
George and l,
we've been up all night long.

140
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,328
I can make up the time to you
any number of ways.

141
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,592
How about this?
Finish this thing up today.

142
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,862
-Couple questions for you.
-No, no more questions.

143
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,098
Just figure it out for yourself
and get it done.

144
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,109
All right, Jerry, but I can figure it out
by myself any way you want.

145
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,544
Just do it.

146
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,053
Costanza. Where's Costanza?

147
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,482
Have you seen Costanza?

148
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,886
I've seen him around.

149
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,551
He was humming this song yesterday.
I can't seem to get it out of my head.

150
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,287
I gotta know the name of that.

151
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,093
She's a heartbreaker
A love-taker

152
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,997
Brubaker run this prison like a man

153
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,695
Something like that.
Very catchy tune. Very, very catchy.

154
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,637
Well, you know what? I'm gonna
sit here and wait for that guy.

155
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,606
What is this, People?

156
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,646
"The Most Beautiful People"
People.

157
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,181
Connie Sellecca.
Nothing wrong that, huh?

158
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,557
Elaine, you're taking this
the wrong way.

159
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,986
That's not what I intended.

160
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,389
Well, what did you intend, Hal?

161
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,359
I just wanted you to have the comfort
and support you deserve.

162
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,159
That's why I had the mattress
custom designed for you.

163
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,824
Custom designed?

164
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,301
They adjust the foam density and
the spring tension to your body type.

165
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,270
I estimated your height and weight:
5'8", about 1 1 0 pounds?

166
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:36,173
Oh, that is the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

167
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,011
-So you do like the mattress?
-I love it.

168
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,383
I'm glad I kept it.

169
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,725
Over there, that's Brooklyn.

170
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,293
That's where Spike Lee lives.

171
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,658
Hey, there's a man
swimming in the water.

172
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,268
No, that's probably
just a dead body, son.

173
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,534
You see, when the mob kills someone,
they throw the body in the river.

174
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,110
Hey, Jerr.

175
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,978
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

176
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,119
Well, my swimming pool
problems are solved.

177
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,120
I just found myself
miles and miles of open lanes.

178
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,384
-What is that smell?
-That's East River.

179
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,227
-You're swimming in the East River?
-Yeah.

180
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,727
The most heavily-trafficked...

181
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,491
...overly-contaminated waterway
on the Eastern Seaboard?

182
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,500
Technically, Norfolk
has more gross tonnage.

183
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,402
How could you swim in that water?

184
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,473
I saw a couple of other guys
out there.

185
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,541
-Swimming?
-Well, floating.

186
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,679
They weren't moving much,
but they were out there.

187
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,765
Hey, Kramer. It's Elaine.

188
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,631
Thanks for bringing
my mattress back...

189
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,070
...and I guess I'll just get
my spare key from you whenever.

190
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,106
All right. Bye.

191
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,112
Oh, this is a good mattress.

192
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,393
Where is this guy? I've been waiting
for three and a half hours.

193
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,189
Should I go? No way, Jack.

194
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,824
I'm not humming it
at the record store again.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,366
-Mr. Steinbrenner?
-That's what they call me.

196
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,663
-Your grandchildren are here.
-Oh, well, send them in.

197
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,137
-Send the tykes in.
-Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa.

198
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,900
Hey, you little kids.

199
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,544
Who are you people?
Come here. Come here.

200
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,306
How about a ride on
the Stein-pony express? Get up here.

201
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,882
What's your name, shorty?
Mel? Are you Mel?

202
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,054
-Hello.
-Jerry, Jerry.

203
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,623
I'm trapped under my desk.
Steinbrenner's in the room.

204
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,317
-You gotta help me.
-Who is this?

205
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,895
-Jerry.
-Hi.

206
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,999
Go away. Bye-bye. Get away.

207
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,763
-Hi, I'm Brian.
-Beat it, Brian. Beat it. Beat it.

208
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,000
Why don't you
just have him paged?

209
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,438
They'll see the extension's
coming from my--

210
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,602
Back off. Come on.

211
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,676
Would you do something?

212
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,248
Call in a bomb threat.

213
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,784
A bomb threat? Why would l
call in a bomb threat?

214
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,750
Just call.

215
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,585
-I think I should have some reason.
-Jerry!

216
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,864
You kids are up on all the new tunes.
Tell me if this rings a bell:

217
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,499
Heartbreaker
Love-taker

218
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,295
Shoemaker
Won't you fix my shoes for free?

219
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,267
Anything? Shorty? Girl?

220
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,704
Mr. Steinbrenner, we received a call.
There's a bomb in the building.

221
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,433
-Thank God.
-A bomb in the building?

222
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,704
Oh, my God. Quick,
everybody under the desk.

223
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,385
Can you imagine
what went through my mind...

224
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,748
...when I saw there wasn't room
under that desk...

225
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,389
...for me and my babies?

226
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,719
-I'm sorry, sir.
-You know what I think?

227
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,820
-I think you knew about that bomb.
-What?

228
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,587
You had a premonition
about the bomb.

229
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,891
You climbed under that desk
because you have ESP.

230
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,193
Quick, George,
put a thought in my mind.

231
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,061
Meatballs, huh? Unbelievable.
You're a wonder, George.

232
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,139
Anyway, this terrorist
had a very specific demand.

233
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,473
No more cheap adjustable hats
for Hat Day.

234
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,138
He wants fitted hats
just like the players wear.

235
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,181
-Jerry. Jerry.
-Yeah.

236
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,086
What the hell is this?

237
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,592
-Where are you?
-Over here.

238
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,321
You can see right through here.

239
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,797
What is this? It's like you're selling
movie tickets back here.

240
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,800
I think it's kind of cozy.

241
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:56,372
All right. You are not gonna believe
what Kramer did to my mattress.

242
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,306
I can't-- I can't talk to you like this.

243
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,613
So Kramer completely
funked up my mattress.

244
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,646
Does it smell like the East River?

245
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,789
Yes, it does. How did you know?

246
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,618
Kramer's been swimming laps
between the Queensboro Bridge...

247
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,024
-...and the Brooklyn Bridge.
-Oh, great!

248
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,299
Oh, man,
I'm on the wrong floor again.

249
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,571
Hey.

250
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,504
Thanks for ruining my mattress.
It reeks.

251
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,645
Hey, you know what I think it is?
I think it's that East River.

252
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,009
I think it might be polluted.

253
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,154
Well, you really did it to me
this time, Seinfeld.

254
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,887
What the hell happened here?

255
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,529
-Hey.
-Hey.

256
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,333
-Look how obtrusive it is.
-lt is obtrusive, isn't it?

257
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,026
-It's very obtrusive.
-I don't think it's that bad.

258
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,571
-Well, can I get a stool in here?
-No, the stools go over there.

259
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,834
No, no, no, that's no good.
I'm leaving.

260
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,571
Yeah, I'm with stinky.
I'm going back to my place.

261
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:17,519
Fitted Hat Day? That's what
you asked Steinbrenner for?

262
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,682
Hey, they're actually
doing the fitted hats? Cool.

263
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,688
Guess who he put in charge
of Fitted Hat Day. Me.

264
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,527
-Hey, look at you.
-Yeah, look at me.

265
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:33,161
Now, I gotta figure out the different
head sizes of 59,000 different people.

266
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,864
What if a pinhead shows up?
I gotta be on top of that.

267
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,635
No knockoffs. I want the ones
like the real players wear.

268
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,845
Forget the fitted hats!
I'm not doing it!

269
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,347
And you're gonna call Steinbrenner
back and cancel the whole thing!

270
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:49,009
-Could you at least get a hat for me?
-Fine. What size?

271
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,315
-Seven and five-eighths.
-Seven and five-eighths!

272
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,890
-Why are you shouting?
-I don't know! It's this place.

273
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,527
I'm very uncomfortable here.

274
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,995
So you're liking the mattress?

275
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,723
Oh, I'm loving it.

276
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,732
You know, we should...

277
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,432
...get going.

278
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,140
-What is that smell?
-What smell?

279
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,909
-I think it's the mattress.
-Did something happen to it?

280
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,642
No, no. Oh, you know what that is?

281
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,854
I went clamming the other day
and I forgot to hose off my boots.

282
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,586
-Clamming?
-Yeah, I clam and scallop.

283
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,354
I clam and scallop.

284
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,566
Yes, yes, come in. Come in.

285
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,227
Sir, I just got a call
from the terrorist.

286
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,397
I told him to call here,
if you have a moment.

287
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,509
Costanza, let me ask you something.
Is it "Fe-bru-ary" or "Feb-uary"?

288
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,307
Because I prefer "uary,"
and what is this rule?

289
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,743
Let me put that
on speaker phone for you, sir.

290
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,150
-Hello, bomber?
-Yeah, this is the terrorist bomber.

291
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,654
You know, Costanza
is busting his hump on those hats.

292
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,816
Yeah, you know, about those hats,
I think maybe I changed my mind.

293
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,928
You don't want them?
They're gone. Goodbye.

294
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,462
-Good thinking, sir.
-Now, what do you want instead?

295
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,395
-What?
-Well, you're the terrorist.

296
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,966
You gotta want something.

297
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,529
It would be nice
if you called ticket-holders...

298
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,297
...if a game is
gonna be rained out.

299
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,600
All right, George,
you can handle that.

300
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,137
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,074
We have to stand tough. That's why
I had to hang up the phone.

302
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,214
When someone's unstable,
don't stir the pot.

303
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,146
Know what I'm gonna do? Run around
the stadium, closing windows.

304
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,546
That's what I'm doing, pal.

305
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,917
And I'll tell you something else:
I am very nervous!

306
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,790
I liked that stuffed-crust pizza,
cheese-in-crust pizza.

307
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,225
-It's just more cheese.
-Let me tell you something.

308
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,594
It'll be years before they find another
place to hide cheese on a pizza.

309
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,995
-Kramer.
-Oh, hey.

310
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,159
Hi. Oh, this is Hal.

311
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,565
Hal, Kramer. Kramer, Hal.

312
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,468
Hal...

313
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,664
...Langerhans.

314
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,101
-Kitzmiller.
-Yeah, Kitzmiller.

315
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,074
-That's right.
-You taking a dip?

316
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,682
-Oh, I'm dipping.
-That smell?

317
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,511
Well, listen I gotta get to the pier.

318
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,119
Ferry traffic gets really bad
around 4:30, but....

319
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,346
Look, I still got your key
to your apartment...

320
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,185
...and I'll give it back to you
as soon as I can.

321
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,059
Baby.

322
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,693
Lunch.

323
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,005
-Kramer.
-Hey.

324
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,736
-Can I talk to you a minute?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

325
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,403
-Oh, boy.
-Kitzmiller.

326
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,846
That's it.

327
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,914
-You and Elaine are pretty close.
-Oh, we go back a ways.

328
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,987
And you've....

329
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,020
How do I put this?

330
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,516
-You've been in her bed.
-That's right.

331
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,759
But this isn't still going on?

332
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,421
No, no, no, she put a stop to that.

333
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,299
That's all I needed to know.

334
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,535
So you actually swim in this thing?

335
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,300
Oh, yeah. Exercises
every muscle in the body.

336
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,966
It's great for the back.

337
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,305
Great for the back. Right.

338
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,280
Four hours in this chop,
and I'm a full inch taller.

339
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,387
Giddyup.

340
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,323
Heartbreaker
Brubaker

341
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,527
Hey, hey, George,
I remember that tune. George?

342
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,562
George?

343
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,324
What's that ticking?

344
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,766
Fire in the hole!

345
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:09,075
I can't believe the Lumbar Yard
wouldn't pick this up.

346
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,917
Okay.

347
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,564
-You want it back the way it was?
-Yeah, that's right.

348
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,701
You know, I don't get you, Seinfeld.

349
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,466
You want something one day.
The next day you don't like it.

350
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,701
I mean, come on, man.
Make a decision.

351
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,375
One second.

352
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,041
-Hello.
-Jerry, you gotta help me.

353
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,844
I threw my back out.

354
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,281
So just lie down.

355
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,149
I am lying down.

356
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:56,056
I am trapped
under a funky mattress.

357
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,363
You gotta go get a doctor...

358
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,365
...or at least come over
and roll this thing off of me.

359
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,061
All right. I'll be right there.

360
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,039
Conrad, I gotta go.

361
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,608
Stay, go. Whatever.

362
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,973
-Hey, Kramer.
-What's going on?

363
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,243
I told my chiropractor how swimming
in the river made my back feel.

364
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,250
He recommended it
to all his patients.

365
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,590
Step aside.

366
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,223
He just sunk like a stone, didn't he?

367
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,197
-Sir, I'm sure it's not a bomb.
-Don't be so brave, George.

368
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
You mess with them.
They're messing with you.

369
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,408
All right, boys, send it in.

370
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,979
Wait. What's that thing
straight ahead?

371
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,311
Is that's anything? Is that Mothra?

372
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,288
Let's check the desk.
That's where I heard the ticking.

373
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,948
Search each of those drawers,
starting with the top one.

374
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:13,004
It's just empty calories
and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?

375
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,298
Looks like there's more
compartments underneath.

376
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,465
Compartments underneath?
Probably where it is.

377
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,702
Okay, boys, let it rip.

378
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,048
I'll tell you what,
starting tomorrow, no more desks.

379
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,653
Just a Lucite table and four legs.

380
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,627
Hey! Hey, watch where you're kicking!

381
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,655
You people find your own river!

382
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,697
-Jeez!
-I'm so sor--

383
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,699
-Kramer.
-Elaine.

384
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,566
Hi. I am loving this.

385
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,536
Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.

386
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,642
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

387
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,313
Hey, Connie. Jerry around?

388
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,754
No, and I prefer Conrad.

389
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,989
So I heard what happened
to the desk.

390
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,326
There was something so reassuring
about that cozy little space.

391
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,866
Yeah, well, whatever. See you.

392
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,297
Back to normal.

393
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,034
Not bad for 4000 bucks.

394
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,554
Can't believe I got the low-fat.
