1
00:00:01,188 --> 00:00:03,908
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,576
Chinese food!

3
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:12,340
Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run.
All you.

4
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:14,074
Who was it?

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:16,476
I did a show for a car dealership
and they're getting me a new SAAB.

6
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:19,601
What about your old car?
They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,369
No, the engine clotted. You know
who set this whole thing up for me?

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,962
Frank Merman.

9
00:00:22,963 --> 00:00:26,683
Fragile Frankie Merman?
I never liked that guy.

10
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:27,441
Why? He's harmless.

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,194
Every summer you guys
went to camp together.

12
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,348
I was jealous. Felt like
he was the summer me.

13
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:36,458
He was not the summer you.
Besides, you had a summer me.

14
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:40,516
Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck
you into Last Tango in Paris.

15
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:45,036
I made him up.
So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?

16
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,376
No.
Too bad. It was erotic.

17
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:55,093
Well... I've had it with these
jackbooted thugs!

18
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:57,280
"Pottery Barn"?

19
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:00,487
I got three "Pottery Barn" 
catalogs in one day.

20
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:02,360
That makes eight this month.

21
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,419
Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,084
Why don't you just throw 'em out?

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,408
Oh, no. I've been saving them up
here in your apartment. And now,

24
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,006
it's payback time. "Pottery
Barn" is in for a world of hurt.

25
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:20,410
Can I have one? I need
one of those old-looking

26
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:22,781
phones. So you wanna grab a bite?

27
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,676
I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.

28
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:27,720
So call now.

29
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,763
I gotta prep. I need a
couple of anecdotes, a few

30
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:32,704
you-were-right-abouts.
It's a whole procedure

31
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,363
Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one

32
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:36,793
that used to run into the
woods every time he got upset?

33
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:38,895
That's him.
Is he still nuts?

34
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,473
What do you think?
They gave me a new car

35
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,812
for thirty minutes of "So,
who's from out of town?"

36
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:50,253
Seriously, is this the best
okra you've ever had, or what?

37
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,323
Mmm. De-lish.

38
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,499
Delish?
Delish. You know, short for delicious.

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,682
Oh, like scrump.
Yeah.

40
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:04,328
I'm gonna be late. See ya later.

41
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,736
Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?
Oh, sure.

42
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,987
Hello?
Hey, it's Georgie.

43
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:24,139
Let me put your father on the phone.
Ma!

44
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:28,219
Who is this?
Dad, it's me.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,466
Hey, listen, I was at
Fortunoff's the other day, and,

46
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,307
you know what, you were right.

47
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,526
Chinese food.

48
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:39,467
Sorry, George, our Chinese food
just came. Talk to you later.

49
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,737
Chinese food?

50
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:51,302
Hey, you like sending out catalogs!?
How do you like gettin' 'em back!?

51
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,820
So, maybe they had Chinese food?
After dark?

52
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:08,949
Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun
grenades.

53
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,503
Well, there's one way to check.

54
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:14,797
Where there's Chinese
food, there's leftovers.

55
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:22,255
Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.

56
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:26,558
That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look
for the Chinese food leftovers.

57
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,611
I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal,
fairy tale moment.

58
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,090
It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?

59
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:38,963
Oh, George's friend.
Whatever happened to him?

60
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:41,838
Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.

61
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,268
So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy,

62
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,450
and this new guy, in a
big pot of love stew.

63
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,655
Oh, yeah... Puddy.

64
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:56,549
Well, I won't fire him
until I see if this new

65
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,655
guy can... handle the workload.

66
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,266
Will you look at this?

67
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:06,627
More catalogs! "Omaha Steaks",
"Mac Warehouse", "Newsweek"?!

68
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:09,786
I can't stop all these
companies, so, I'm gonna attack

69
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:11,605
this problem at the choke point.

70
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:15,000
Stop the mail?
That's... even better!

71
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:24,254
So, where's the car?
This is it.

72
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,165
Inside the van?
It is the van!

73
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:31,141
Don't you remember, we
always talked about how cool

74
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:33,471
it would be to have
a van and just drive?

75
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:38,276
We were ten.
Come on. Let's take it for a spin.

76
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:41,508
I don't want a van.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.

77
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:42,205
You don't understand.

78
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:45,232
This is Fragile Frankie Merman.
When we were incamp, if you

79
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:48,560
upset him, he'd run out to the
woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.

80
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,370
Well, I have an idea.

81
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,869
Keep the van, and get
a bumper sticker that

82
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,081
says, "If this vans a-rockin',
don't come a-knockin'."

83
00:04:58,128 --> 00:04:59,497
Always helpful.

84
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:06,039
Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?
Just dropped in for a visit.

85
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:11,208
You, uh, you never called me back.
Uh... the phone broke.

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,275
Well, we got to get moving.

87
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,308
What? Where are you going?
We have a catered affair.

88
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:22,455
It's creative black tie. Move, woman.

89
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:33,275
No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin'
suspicious.

90
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,022
Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.

91
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:46,656
I'm gonna be in the can.
Okay, Jack.

92
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:50,086
Can I use your phone?
Sure.

93
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:57,527
Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through.
Yeah, that's right. Again.

94
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:06,055
Nice captain's chairs, huh?
Aye, aye.

95
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:09,427
Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.

96
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,481
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
No, that's us.

97
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,617
Great. You know, Frankie,

98
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,821
I was wondering.  What if
I decided that it's silly

99
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:21,968
to drive a van, because, you know,

100
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,770
I live in New York City.

101
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:29,379
Is there maybe some way
I could exchange it?

102
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,240
You don't like the van?

103
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,066
No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
I gotta go to the park.

104
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,501
No! No, you don't! No woods.
I love the van. I'm a van guy.

105
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,978
Check it out.

106
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:44,931
Rain and sleet may not stop

107
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:47,979
them, but let's see them
get by... these bricks.

108
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,769
Where'd you get the bricks?
Jerry, the whole building is brick.

109
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,142
So you want to take a
ride with me out to Jersey?

110
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,955
I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.

111
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:02,274
A dealer? Are you insane?
No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.

112
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:04,311
I don't think I want to meet the people

113
00:07:04,312 --> 00:07:06,397
that are in the market for a used van.

114
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,460
Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
OK.
All right! OK!

115
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:14,495
Right, here we go.
Yeah. OK, so... "For sale.

116
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:21,430
For Sale A big,
juicy van."

117
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,466
And, ooh, you gotta put down,
"interesting trades considered."

118
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,591
I don't want to trade.

119
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:33,165
No, you don't have to.
It's all about tickling their buying bone.

120
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:37,849
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail.
They're puttin' it in my box now.

121
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:43,372
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far.

122
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,393
They keep pushing me, and pushing me.

123
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:51,346
Now I got no choice but to go
down there... and talk to them.

124
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:56,387
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone.
This is Jack.

125
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,497
May I help you?
Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.

126
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,473
Certainly. How long would
you like us to hold it?

127
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:12,592
Oh, no, no. I don't think you
get me. I want out, permanently.

128
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,917
I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take
your three hour break?

129
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:20,676
Oh, calm down, everyone.
No one's cancelling any mail.

130
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:23,264
Oh, yes, I am.
What about your bills?

131
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,379
The bank can pay 'em.
The bank.

132
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,806
What about your cards and letters?
E-mail, telephones,

133
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:33,279
fax machines. Fedex, telex,
telegrams, holograms.

134
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,975
All right, it's true! Of
course nobody needs mail.

135
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:38,821
What do you think, you're so
clever for figuring that out?

136
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:42,816
But you don't know the
half ofwhat goes on here.

137
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:46,229
So just walk away,
Kramer. I beg of you.

138
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:50,410
Is everything all right here,
Postal Employee Newman?

139
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:55,348
Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away.
Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?

140
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,824
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!

141
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,016
Welcome back.
Oh!

142
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:11,491
Quick for a... catered affair.
I don't know what you mean.

143
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:16,334
You ditched me. That's twice.
Now I demand to know what's going on!

144
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,059
George, we've had it with you.

145
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,269
Understand? We love you like a son,
but even parents have limits.

146
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:29,618
The breakups, the firings.
And every Sunday with the calls.

147
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:33,947
What my wife is trying to say
is that this is supposed to be our time.

148
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:37,480
I'm not following.
We're cuttin' you lose.

149
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,138
You're cuttin' me loose?

150
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:43,334
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
going to make love to your mother.

151
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:49,535
They don't want to see me anymore!

152
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:52,309
But this is what you've always wanted.

153
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,021
It is. I'm just not ready yet.
Aw, that's kind of sweet.

154
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:59,538
Ah, shut up, Jerry.

155
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,163
My parents think they can ignore me.

156
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:05,145
Heh heh.  Well, they
better think again.

157
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,844
Oh, no. George, please.
What are you going to do?

158
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,604
You remember my cousin
Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.

159
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:12,792
Mother of God.

160
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,324
One little wink. She'll
freak out, tell my parents.

161
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,969
They'll be all over
me. Who is this guy?

162
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:22,259
That guy Elaine's dating
seems really familiar to me.

163
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,669
I think he may have been a
comedian I worked with one time.

164
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,493
Wait a minute, what is this?

165
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:39,038
Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz!
I'm the Wiz!

166
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,838
That is the guy!
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?

167
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,870
No, she thinks she's in
love with him. But she's

168
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,400
just remembering this old commercial.

169
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,996
That's pretty pathetic.
I know. They're not even related.

170
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,015
I'm gonna get going.
Hey, have fun at the... family reunion.

171
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:05,088
So, what do you know
about this Jack fellow?

172
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,816
Isn't he the best?

173
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,755
Yeah, nobody beats him.

174
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:12,193
What kind of work does he do?

175
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:15,870
Oh, right now he's a fact
checker for New York Magazine.

176
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:21,048
It's not much, but it has
a certain type of quiet dignity.

177
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:29,034
Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say,
this?

178
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,973
Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
Oh no!

179
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:40,816
Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure,
come on buy.

180
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:43,950
Yeah, I called about the van.

181
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,569
Some more merlot?
Yeah, thanks.

182
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:55,517
Sure. You know, Rhisa.

183
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,065
I've always found you... very attractive.
What?

184
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:04,401
I know it may sound shocking.

185
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:09,493
But, I just can't stop myself from...
wanting you.

186
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:12,070
You want to borrow money, right?

187
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:16,396
No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.

188
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:20,285
All right.
All right?

189
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:26,211
Let's go for it.
Well... we could dance around it a little first.

190
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:30,600
Nah. Let's be bad, George.
Let's be really... bad.

191
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,903
So, how come you're selling it?

192
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:38,448
You know why I'm
selling it. I hate it.

193
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:41,107
How many miles?
Two.

194
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:42,155
City or highway?

195
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:45,414
Look, do you really want
to buy this thing, or what?

196
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:47,739
Hey, hey. Take it
easy. I'm not gonna be

197
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,787
pressured. I'll walk away right now.

198
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:53,314
Is this thing bent?

199
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:55,492
I'm not paying for that.

200
00:12:55,493 --> 00:13:01,676
All right, just get out of here.
All right, look. I'm going to be honest.

201
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,985
I'm very interested in the
van.

202
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:07,625
OK, fine. "What do I have to do to put you
in this van today?"

203
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,867
Well, I don't really have any money.

204
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:13,441
But it says right here,
"interesting trades considered".

205
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:15,417
You put that in!
And I'm glad I did. Here.

206
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,450
You want to trade me an undershirt?

207
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:23,455
No, I want to trade you screen
legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt.

208
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:27,037
He took this off to do sit-ups
in the park and I nabbed it.

209
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:31,153
That's disgusting.
Well, it's my final offer.

210
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:36,198
You dumped me for some
idiotic TV pitchman.

211
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,282
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy.
It-it was a mistake.

212
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,544
So, let's just put it behind us,

213
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:44,935
and we can continue like
this never happened.

214
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:47,606
Gee, I don't know. What
if we're out somewhere

215
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:49,651
and you see the Maytag  repairman.

216
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,543
You're not taking me back?
That's right.

217
00:13:54,077 --> 00:14:00,375
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz.
And nobody beats him. Nobody...

218
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,036
Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it

219
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:09,424
on. Hey, mail blows.
Fax it to a friend.

220
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:11,939
Why does this dummy have
a bucket on its head?

221
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,924
Because we're blind to their tyranny.

222
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:16,551
Then shouldn't you
be wearing the bucket?

223
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:18,108
Yeah. Move along, Betty.

224
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,953
Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?

225
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:25,994
Well, not anymore. He traded it
to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.

226
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,030
I'm, uh, I'm so stupid.
What?

227
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:33,236
I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
Yeah, nice to meet you.

228
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:36,525
She's into it?

229
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:40,318
She's leaving me dirty messages
on my answering machine.

230
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,680
So have your parents
found out about it?

231
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,273
She wants to keep it quiet.

232
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,123
She wants to keep it
quiet. She... thinks we have

233
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,066
a real future  together.

234
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,083
Brave new world, alright.

235
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:54,255
Hey, you guys.
Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?

236
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,432
Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front
of the post office today,

237
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:00,761
and not one person went in.
It's Sunday.

238
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:05,353
Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
Huh?

239
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,592
Well, it symbolizes our persecution.

240
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:10,496
Then... shouldn't you
be wearing the bucket.

241
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:13,645
Hey, I want my van keys back.

242
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:16,498
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made
a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.

243
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:19,527
Are you insane? Give 'em to me.

244
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,428
No, I can't, I can't. See, I
told Frank he could borrow it.

245
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,328
Yeah, he wants to move some of
George's stuff into storage.

246
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,292
Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight?
This is perfect.

247
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:33,050
I'll drive Rhisa to someplace
romantic. Then when my father slides

248
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,583
the door open, I'm in the van
kissing his brother's daughter.

249
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:39,109
Oh, listen, Jerry. One
of your friends came by

250
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,301
and he was very upset
that I had your wheels.

251
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,574
Oh, no, not Frankie.

252
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,336
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then
he went running into the park.

253
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:47,437
Oh, no, the woods! The hole!

254
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,475
Kramer, what the hell are you doing?

255
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:58,097
I know, I'm gonna switch
the bucket to something else.

256
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:00,200
Not that!
What?

257
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:01,777
You're in trouble, Kramer.

258
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:04,305
I shouldn't even be talking to you, but
I'm telling you as a friend.

259
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:06,600
Here's how it's going
to happen: you may be

260
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:09,003
walking. Maybe on a crisp,
autumn day just like today.

261
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,823
When a mail truck will slow
beside you, and a door will open,

262
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:13,678
and a mailman you
know, maybe even trust,

263
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:15,921
will offer to give you a lift.
Are you through?

264
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:20,623
No! And no one will ever see you again!
Are you through?

265
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:24,059
Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.

266
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,083
Quick! Get in!

267
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:33,729
Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it
was going down.

268
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,933
There's another way it can go down,
and it's going down right now!

269
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:40,093
No. You said a mailman I know,
and you're a mailman I know!

270
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,451
I know you know, but
you don't know what I know.

271
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,227
Frankie, is that you?
My name is Edgar.

272
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:57,409
Have a nice night.
Thank you.

273
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:04,829
Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?

274
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:13,635
All right, George. I'm ready.

275
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,665
Yeah, hold on. I'm,
uh, I'm just trying to get

276
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,763
a reading on my dashboard compass.

277
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:23,125
Where are my parents?

278
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:29,313
Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?
Seinfeld's van?!

279
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,064
Wait. What's he saying?

280
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,492
I think he's saying "Son
of Sam"! Oh, my God!

281
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:36,552
No, they caught him.
I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!

282
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:45,516
So I told him, "Hit the road.
I'm going back with Jack."

283
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,956
Elaine, that's the second
piece of good news today.

284
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:50,616
Really, what was the first?

285
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:55,894
They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz
again.

286
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,874
I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!

287
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:04,892
Well what, what about
your fact-checking job?

288
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:10,483
Oh... here's a fact. Uh,
I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz

289
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:13,071
and noooobody beats me!

290
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:18,377
Frankie... come on out of
there.

291
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,949
You hate the van.
But I'm keeping it.

292
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:24,123
As much as I hate the idea
of being a van guy,it's much

293
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:27,519
better than hanging out here
with the nocturnal dirt people.

294
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:32,167
So, can we go for a ride?
Yeah, let's just get out of here.

295
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:38,357
Are you done
with that?

296
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:45,473
Good. He left the door unlocked.

297
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:49,066
Why did Kramer have to
park the van in the woods?

298
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,401
Isn't it obvious?
There are no parking meters out here.

299
00:18:54,644 --> 00:19:02,278
Hey, look at this. Hoochie
mama!

300
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,461
Oh, my goodness.
What have they done to you here?

301
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,607
Huh? Who are you?

302
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:19,409
Well, you can just call me Henry.
Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?

303
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:21,808
Last time I checked.

304
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:26,234
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit.

305
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:31,713
I mean, after all, I drove
all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.

306
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:34,935
I even had to cancel a round
of golf with the secretary

307
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:37,242
of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?

308
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,530
Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some
of your material  here.

309
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:48,126
I gotta be honest with you: you make
a pretty strong case.

310
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:52,307
I mean, just imagine. An army
of men in wool pants running

311
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:57,218
through the neighborhood handing
out pottery catalogs, door to door.

312
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:04,406
Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious
about it.

313
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:09,506
In addition to being a postmaster,
I'm a general.

314
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:17,602
And we both know, it's the
job of a general to, by God, get things done.

315
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:20,143
So maybe you can understand why I get

316
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:24,093
a little irritated when someone
calls me away from my golf.

317
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,351
I'm sorry.
I'm very very sorry.

318
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:31,070
I think we got a stack of mail out
at the desk that belongs to you.

319
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:34,001
Now, you want that mail,
don't you Mr. Kramer?

320
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:37,060
Sure do!
Now, that's better.

321
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:43,836
Geez. Newman?

322
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,027
Tell the world my story.

323
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:59,650
Hey, George!
Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!

324
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:02,256
What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.

325
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,615
Oh. The summer me.
The winter me.

326
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:10,108
You must be George's cousin.
Girlfriend.

327
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:18,500
What is that? That van's a-rockin'.

328
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:21,038
Don't go a-knockin'.

329
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:25,176
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

330
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:30,028
Now you gotta sell this van.
Oh, yeah.

331
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,059
What you saw in that van
was a natural expression

332
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,669
of a man's love for his lady.

333
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,795
Your father's right. It's beautiful.
And it was safe.

334
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:55,030
Oh, God...
Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...

335
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:56,605
Oh... make it stop.
