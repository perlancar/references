1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,203
All right, how about this?
You're abducted by aliens.

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,365
-Fine.
-Haul you aboard the mothership...

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,908
...take you back to their planet
as a curiosity.

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:15,514
Now, would you rather be
in their zoo or their circus?

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,540
I gotta go zoo.

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,242
I feel like I could set
more of my own schedule.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,389
In the circus, you get to ride
on the train, see the whole planet.

8
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm wearing a little hat.
I'm jumping through fire.

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,053
Putting their little alien heads
in my mouth.

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,954
-At least it's show business.
-Yeah.

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:35,192
But in the zoo, you know, they might
put a woman in there with me...

12
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,960
...to, you know, get me to mate.

13
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,196
What if she's got no interest in you?

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,203
Then I'm pretty much
where I am right now.

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,365
Just got to take a ride
on a spaceship.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,120
George, why couldn't I use
the bathroom in that store?

17
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,883
Kramer, trust me, this is
the best bathroom in Midtown.

18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,754
He knows.

19
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,554
It's right in there, on the left.

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,098
Exquisite marble, high ceilings
and a flush like a jet engine:

21
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,429
Now, listen, you better not wait.
I'll catch you later.

22
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,869
-You sure?
-He knows.

23
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:23,942
Nice.

24
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,143
Why don't you try
your engagement story?

25
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,154
-Won't work.
-Are you sure?

26
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,260
He knows.

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,665
Look, Kevin, I really like you...

28
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:48,434
...but maybe we'd be better off
just being friends.

29
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,776
-Friends?
-Yeah. I mean--

30
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,341
Oh, God...

31
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,483
...this tuna tastes like an old sponge.

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,280
Friends. Yeah. Why not friends?

33
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,446
I might like to try that.

34
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,114
Like you and Jerry.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,559
This damn thing is jammed again.

36
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,202
You know what happens with these?

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,168
The rollers,
they get flat spots on them.

38
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,069
Hey, Leland wants everyone
in the conference room now.

39
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:29,306
-Come on, let's go.
-Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,879
Okay.

41
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,149
I was telling you about Gillian...

42
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,518
...my friend who writes
for the L.L. Bean catalog.

43
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,717
I really think
you should give her a call.

44
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,022
I don't know, do you have it--?

45
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,392
-Not bad. What does she--?
-I put her stats on the back.

46
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,004
Pretty impressive.
Serious boyfriend, '92 to '95.

47
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,904
-Owns her own car.
-Yup.

48
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,806
Favorite president, James Polk.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,238
Let me see that.

50
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,680
So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you
steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?

51
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,653
You are not gonna believe this. I told
him that I just wanted to be friends.

52
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:13,223
He's fine with it.
He really wants to be friends.

53
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:18,092
-Why would anybody want a friend?
-It's really not that bad, actually.

54
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,357
He said he'd go
to the Museum of Miniatures.

55
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,524
This is something
you would never, ever do.

56
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,637
I mean, all that stuff is so small.

57
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,203
Stupid.

58
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,376
You know, if I told my engagement
story to that receptionist...

59
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,412
...but told her this was my fiancée....

60
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,413
-What?
-Don't you see?

61
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:42,886
Women like that are like members of a
secret tribe living in a forbidden city.

62
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,389
People like me have not been
inside in thousands of years.

63
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,286
But with this, it's like I've already
been with one of her own.

64
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:55,195
My hand's been stamped.
I come and go as I please.

65
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,393
Well, you've cracked it.

66
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,664
I warned the queen
you were getting close and...

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,606
...now it looks like we're gonna have to
move the whole damn forbidden city.

68
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,305
-Can I keep this?
-No, I need it.

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,072
Thanks.

70
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,417
Hi. I'm-- I'm here to see
a Mr. Art Vandalay.

71
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,252
I'm sorry, sir,
there is no Mr. Vandalay here.

72
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,825
Well, let me--

73
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:26,364
Let me just check and make sure
I have the right name.

74
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,432
I seem to-- Oh, l--

75
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,461
Oh, she's beautiful. Who is she?

76
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:36,464
Well, if you must know,
she was my fiancée, Susan.

77
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,304
May she rest in peace.

78
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,845
I am so sorry. She was lovely.

79
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,047
-I'm Amanda.
-I'm George.

80
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,483
-Good work today, K-Man.
-You know what they say:

81
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,317
You don't sell the steak,
you sell the sizzle.

82
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,619
-Who's up for drinks? I'm buying.
-ln that case, make mine a double.

83
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,355
-Jerry?
-Gillian.

84
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,501
-Hi.
-It's very nice to meet you.

85
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,899
It's nice to meet you.

86
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,407
She had man-hands.

87
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,646
-Man-hands?
-The hands of a man.

88
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,187
It's like a creature
out of Greek mythology.

89
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:28,589
I mean, she was like part woman,
part horrible beast.

90
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,031
Would you prefer it
if she had no hands at all?

91
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,224
Would she have hooks?

92
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,601
Do.... Do hooks make it
more attractive, Jerry?

93
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,003
Kind of cool-looking.

94
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,641
Okay, listen. You're picking me up
from White Plains tomorrow, right?

95
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,804
Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,109
Okay, I got five
huge boxes of buttons.

97
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,277
If you need an extra set of hands,
I know who you can call.

98
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,025
-Kramer?
-Hey, buddy. Hey.

99
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,561
It's 8 in the morning.
What the hell is going on?

100
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,696
Breakfast. I gotta be in
at Brandt-Leland by 9.

101
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,607
Why?

102
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,135
Because I'm working there,
that's why.

103
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,976
How long have I been asleep?
What year is it?

104
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,209
Look, Jerry, I don't know
if you've noticed...

105
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,877
...but lately I've been
drifting aimlessly.

106
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,056
Now that you mention it....

107
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,284
But I finally realized
what's missing in my life.

108
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,223
Structure.

109
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,728
And at Brandt-Leland,
I'm getting things done.

110
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,661
And I love the people
I'm working with.

111
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,430
-How much are they paying you?
-No, no, no. I don't want any pay.

112
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,731
I'm doing this just for me.

113
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,134
Clearly.

114
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,434
So, what do you do
down there all day?

115
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,043
TCB.

116
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,769
You know, taking care of business.

117
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,909
I gotta go. All right, then.

118
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,212
I'll see you tonight.

119
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,287
Forget my briefcase.

120
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,016
-Well, what do you got in there?
-Crackers.

121
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,217
So the picture worked. Amazing!

122
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,793
Hey, she wants me
to dress smart casual.

123
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,293
What--? What is that?

124
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,796
-I don't know, but you don't have it.
-Right. Bye.

125
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,068
-Where were you today?
-What?

126
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,573
Pick up.

127
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,002
-Damn.
-So? Where were you?

128
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,912
Here, I guess.
And I went out and picked up a paper.

129
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:11,148
I had to ask Kevin to leave his office
and come and pick me up.

130
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,189
-Well, what are friends for?
-Yes.

131
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,826
And he is a friend, Jerry.

132
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:20,728
He's reliable, he's considerate,
he's like your exact opposite.

133
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,266
So he's Bizarro Jerry.

134
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,164
Bizarro Jerry?

135
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,771
Yeah, like Bizarro Superman.

136
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,999
Superman's exact opposite...

137
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,542
...who lives in the backwards
Bizarro World.

138
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,710
Up is down, down is up.

139
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,180
He says hello when he leaves,
goodbye when he arrives.

140
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,342
Shouldn't he say "badbye"?

141
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,682
Isn't that the opposite of goodbye?

142
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,015
No, it's still goodbye.

143
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,222
-Does he live underwater?
-No.

144
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,195
-ls he black?
-Just forget the whole thing, all right?

145
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,764
Wow, man.

146
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,269
What a day.

147
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,104
-Could I use a drink!
-Tough day at the office?

148
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,873
People kept coming in,
and that phone just wouldn't stop.

149
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,042
We better get going if we're gonna
go to that 7:00 Hall of Fusion.

150
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,687
Yeah, well, count me out.
I'm swimming in it.

151
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,791
Old man Leland is busting
my hump over these reports.

152
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,950
If I don't get them done
by 9, I'm toast.

153
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,528
All right, I have to go.

154
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh, and listen, could you
keep it down to a low roar?

155
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,741
Some of us have to work
in the morning. Thanks.

156
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,742
This is a fantastic place.

157
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,484
I always thought
it was a meat-packing plant.

158
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,244
Hey, Amanda.

159
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,115
These are my friends,
Annabell, Justina and Mickey.

160
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,783
-We used to model together.
-Oh, modeling.

161
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,520
What's that like, fun?

162
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,255
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

163
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,766
So, Mickey,
how was Paris this time?

164
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,164
A bore.

165
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:10,708
You know who used to love Paris?
My dead fiancée, Susan.

166
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:15,472
In fact, I think I may have
a picture of her.

167
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,613
She was beautiful.

168
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,615
Do you wanna dance?

169
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,789
-Would you like some bread, Jerry?
-No. No, thanks, I'm just not hungry.

170
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,525
Well, then, at least drink your beer.

171
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,133
It's not a twist-off.

172
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,805
You have a little something
on your face.

173
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,810
I can get it.

174
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,469
No, no, no.
You're missing it. It's higher.

175
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,810
It's an eyelash. Make a wish.

176
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,817
-I don't want to.
-Make a wish.

177
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,649
Okay.

178
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,820
Didn't come true.

179
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,329
Don't you just love lobster?

180
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,870
That Museum of Miniatures
was amazing.

181
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,873
-I know, it was so tiny.
-Yeah.

182
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,239
Hey, guys. Elaine, sit down.

183
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,711
These are a couple of my friends.
This is Gene...

184
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,343
...and this guy we just call Feldman.

185
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,349
Bizarro World.

186
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,690
Jerry, it was incredible.

187
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,697
Models as far as the eye could see.

188
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,394
-Then it does exist.
-Yes, the legends are true.

189
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,232
When are you
going out with her again?

190
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,634
I'm not.

191
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,742
I'm inside the walls.

192
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,273
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

193
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,208
-Flame on!
-So when are we going?

194
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:02,049
Well, it's a pretty fast-paced crowd.

195
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,787
What would you wear? That?

196
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,950
You know, I'm the one who's actually
dating the woman in the picture.

197
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,356
Yeah.

198
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,793
But I was engaged to her.

199
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,796
-I got it.
-You got it last time.

200
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,732
Don't worry about it.

201
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,168
This is unbelievable.

202
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,571
Say, Elaine, what do you think
of an alarm clock...

203
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,440
...that automatically tells you
the weather when you wake up?

204
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:33,277
Well, I gotta say, I think that
that is a fantastic idea, Feldman.

205
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,747
I don't know. It's not practical.

206
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,651
Well, see you later, Elaine.

207
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,951
Feldman and I gotta get down
to the library.

208
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,255
-What are you gonna do down there?
-Read.

209
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,502
Hello.

210
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,739
So Gillian's coming over later.
I'm gonna end it.

211
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:06,117
Those meaty paws. I feel like I'm
dating George "The Animal" Steele.

212
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,775
Yeah.

213
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,721
Maybe I'll chain her
to the refrigerator and sell tickets.

214
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,986
That's nice.

215
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,993
Kramer, put the paper down.
You never listen to me anymore.

216
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,496
-We hardly even talk.
-Well, we're talking now, aren't we?

217
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,134
-I see you 20 minutes in the morning...
-Oh, here we go.

218
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,293
...and when you come home
you're exhausted.

219
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,406
-We never do anything anymore.
-What are you starting with me for?

220
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,872
You know this
is my crazy time of year.

221
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,306
It's your third day.

222
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,412
I gotta go to work.
We'll talk about this later.

223
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,149
Well...

224
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,882
...call if you're gonna be late.

225
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:53,430
-What is going on with you two?
-Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.

226
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,168
All right, listen.
Have you seen my addre--?

227
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,237
There it is. Okay. I got it.
I'll see you later.

228
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,842
Hey, wait a second. Where you going?
I hardly ever see you anymore.

229
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,141
Well, l--

230
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,571
I guess I've been at Reggies.

231
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,544
The Bizarro coffee shop?

232
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,082
Kevin and his friends
are nice people.

233
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,913
They do good things.

234
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,419
-They read.
-I read.

235
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,353
Books, Jerry.

236
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,058
Big deal.

237
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,398
I can't spend the rest of my life...

238
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,232
...coming into this stinking apartment
every 1 0 minutes...

239
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:39,036
...to pore over
the excruciating minutiae...

240
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,477
...of every single daily event.

241
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,743
Why not? Like, yesterday, I went
to the bank to make a deposit...

242
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,753
-...and the teller gives me this look--
-I'll see you later, man. I gotta go.

243
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,517
The whole system is breaking down.

244
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,905
Hey. Amanda, hi, yeah.

245
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,567
Listen, you know, I'm thinking we
might just be better off being friends.

246
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,011
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?
I can't really talk about it right now.

247
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,013
Bye-bye.

248
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,323
No. No!

249
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,927
-Friends? Just friends.
-Yeah.

250
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,756
All right. Well, do you still
wanna see a movie later?

251
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,793
I wish I could, but we're friends.

252
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,836
-I'm just gonna go wash my hands.
-Good idea.

253
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,299
There's a beach towel on the rack.

254
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,973
-Yeah.
-Jerry!

255
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,774
My hair dryer ruined the picture.

256
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,474
I need one or I can't
get back into the forbidden city.

257
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,847
Who is this?

258
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,853
Jerry! I need you to get
another picture of man-hands.

259
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,854
I'm begging you.

260
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,488
If I get it, will you take me to that club
and show me a good time?

261
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,324
Yes, yes, all right. Anything.

262
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,432
Okay.

263
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,173
Got it.

264
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,980
Jerry.

265
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,587
-Hey, Jerry?
-I'm right here.

266
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,960
-You're late.
-Yeah, well, I got held up, you know.

267
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,929
-What happened to your hand?
-Like you care.

268
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,500
-Work piled up, I lost track of the time.
-Sure. Sure.

269
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,194
You and your work.
Elaine's off in the Bizarro World...

270
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,431
...George only calls
when he wants something...

271
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,700
...and I'm left sitting here
like this chicken.

272
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,903
Which, by the way, was for two.

273
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,208
-What? You cooked?
-I ordered in. It's still effort.

274
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,146
-Jeez.
-What's wrong?

275
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,118
-It's my stomach.
-You're probably getting an ulcer.

276
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,189
This job is killing you.

277
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,553
It's killing us.

278
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,161
You know what? You're right.

279
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,797
These reports, they can wait.

280
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,899
Say we go out tonight.
Any place you want.

281
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,891
-The coffee shop?
-You got it.

282
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,627
I'll call George.

283
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,507
Hey, isn't that Elaine?

284
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,199
Maybe she can get another picture.

285
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,605
-Elaine?
-Elaine?

286
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,145
-Elaine?
-Hey, Elaine.

287
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,874
Hi. Over here.

288
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,587
Jerry, George, Kramer...

289
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:52,101
...this is Kevin, Gene and Feldman.

290
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,504
-Yeah.
-Nice to meet you.

291
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,073
This is really weird.

292
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,577
Could you guys excuse us
just for a moment?

293
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,409
-Sure.
-Thanks.

294
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,445
What? What do you guys want?

295
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,780
I've got to have
another picture of Gillian.

296
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,049
I tried to get him one, but man-hands
almost ripped my arm out.

297
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,852
-You could have.
-I could not.

298
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,507
Guys, I gotta go. Take it easy.

299
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,012
Elaine?

300
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,014
-Can I come?
-I'm sorry.

301
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,981
We've already got a George.

302
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,328
What did you wanna see
me about, Mr. Leland?

303
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:55,900
Kramer, I've been reviewing your work.
Quite frankly, it stinks.

304
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,098
Well, l....

305
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,206
I've been having trouble at home.

306
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:06,367
I mean, you know, I'll work harder,
nights, weekends, whatever it takes.

307
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:10,106
No. No.
I don't think that's going to do it.

308
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,648
These reports you handed in...

309
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,015
...it's almost as if you have
no business training at all.

310
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,152
I don't know
what this is supposed to be.

311
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,323
Well, I'm just trying to get ahead.

312
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,863
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way
that we could keep you on.

313
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,094
But I don't even really work here.

314
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,406
That's what makes this so difficult.

315
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,047
Hi, I'm George.

316
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,207
Are you sure
you're supposed to be here?

317
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,613
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

318
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,447
I used to come here
with my fiancée...

319
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,953
...back when it was
a meat-packing plant.

320
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,422
Here's her picture.

321
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,687
What'd you do? Cut this out
of a magazine or something?

322
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,797
-What?
-That's me.

323
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,694
It's from a Clinique ad I did.

324
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,232
Look at that.

325
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,366
Let's go. Private party.

326
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,900
It's Laney.

327
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,572
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hi, Kevin.

328
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,538
-Come on in.
-Okay.

329
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,740
Hi, Gene.

330
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,006
-What's up?
-Just reading.

331
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,744
Hey, what are you doing?

332
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,819
-Eating olives.
-Ever hear of asking?

333
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,088
-Who is it?
-Feldman.

334
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,252
-From across the hall.
-Hold on.

335
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,663
-Hey.
-Hey, Kevin.

336
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,772
-Hi.
-Look who I ran into.

337
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,074
-Hello, Kevin.
-Hello, Vargas.

338
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,307
-Wanna catch a game this weekend?
-Great.

339
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,314
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

340
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,481
Vargas.

341
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,646
-Well, I got them.
-All right.

342
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,759
Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able
to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi.

343
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,091
-Fourth row, center.
-Get out!

344
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,167
-What's the matter with you?
-Oh, Kevin.

345
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,032
I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

346
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,900
Haven't you done enough already?

347
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,342
I'll just....

348
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,311
It's--

349
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,009
It's locked.

350
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,860
So this is it, huh?

351
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,261
But it was here.

352
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,666
It was here, I'm telling you.
It was really here.

353
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,070
There was a bar and a dance floor.

354
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,904
I guess the DJ booth was over there
behind the bone saw?

355
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,004
Let's get out of here, George.

356
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:48,897
At work, I discovered a pay phone in
the lobby that has free long distance.

357
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,193
Oh, so, what did you do?

358
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,236
I called the phone company
and immediately reported the error.

359
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,305
Nice.

360
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,432
-Who is it?
-Feldman.

361
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,841
-From across the hall.
-Hold on.

362
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,283
-Kevin. Brought you some groceries.
-Again?

363
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:13,220
-Feldman, you didn't have to do that.
-Hey, what are friends for?

364
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,087
You know,
I may not say this enough...

365
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,663
...but you two are about
the best friends a guy could have.

366
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,698
Me so happy.

367
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,269
Me want to cry.
