1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,330
Professional tennis--

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,333
l don't understand the shushing.
Why are they always shushing?

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,135
Don't the players know
that we're there?

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,845
Should we duck behind the seats
so they don't see us watching them?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,040
To me, tennis is basically
just Ping-Pong...

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,015
...and the players
are standing on the table.

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,120
That's all it is.

8
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,755
And that goofy scoring.

9
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:27,051
You win one point, all of a sudden
you're up by 1 5.

10
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:32,030
Two points, 30-love. 30-love.

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,190
Sounds like an English call girl.
''That'll be 30, love.

12
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,761
And could you be a little quieter
next time, please?''

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,046
Are these seats unbelievable,
or what?

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,378
-Hey, where's the sunblock?
-Here.

15
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,485
Twenty-five? You don't have
anything higher?

16
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:59,648
-What, are you on Mercury?
-l need higher.

17
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,488
This has PABA in it.
l need PABA-free.

18
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,264
-You got a problem with PABA?
-l have a problem with PABA.

19
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,096
-You don't even know what PABA is.
-l know enough to stay away from it.

20
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,163
<i>Thirty-love.</i>

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,901
-So you going to Todd's party?
-lf somebody else drives. You going?

22
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,013
-Gwen really wants to go.
-You're bringing a date to a party?

23
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,609
No good?

24
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,842
A party's a bad date situation.
lt doesn't matter who you're with.

25
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,646
You could be with J. Edgar Hoover.

26
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,518
You don't wanna sit and talk with
Hoover all night. You want to circulate.

27
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,057
Why'd you pick Hoover?
ls he that interesting to talk to?

28
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,062
Well, with the law enforcement
and the cross-dressing...

29
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,359
...seems like an interesting guy.

30
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,796
Yeah, l guess.

31
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,960
What can l do?
l gotta take her with me.

32
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,470
Todd introduced us. l'm obligated.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,473
That woman is absolutely stunning.

34
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,779
-Who, the Croat?
-No, not the Croat. The lineswoman.

35
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,780
That is the most beautiful lineswoman
l've ever seen.

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,850
Yeah, she's a BL.

37
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,784
-BL?
-Beautiful lineswoman.

38
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,493
l'm gonna go to the concession stand
to get some real sunblock.

39
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,128
You want anything? Jerry?

40
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,994
Jerry?

41
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,762
You know, l just heard
the Lexington line is out.

42
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,804
You are kidding me. How am l
supposed to get to this meeting?

43
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,839
Take a car service.
We have an account.

44
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,840
No, forget it. l hate those.

45
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,469
Every time l've taken one,
the driver will not stop talking to me.

46
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,947
No matter how disinterested l seem,
he just keeps yakking away.

47
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,854
Why does everything have
to have a social component?

48
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,254
See, the stagecoach. Now, that
would've been a good situation for me.

49
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,156
l'm in the coach, and the driver's
way up there on the stage.

50
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,856
You're not gonna get a cab now,
4:30 on a Friday afternoon.

51
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,864
Bring a magazine.
Keep your head down.

52
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,525
Yeah, l guess that could work.

53
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,916
<i>And that is it.</i>
<i>Match to Ms. Natalia Baudone.</i>

54
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,783
<i>Coming up next, men's singles.</i>

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,226
<i>But for now, let's stop and look at</i>
<i>our beautiful tennis-center backdrop.</i>

56
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,292
Hey!

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,233
There's George.

58
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,235
<i>Holy cow. It's a scorcher.</i>

59
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,005
<i>Boy, I bet you that guy</i>
<i>could cover a lot of court.</i>

60
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,975
<i>Hey, buddy, they got a new</i>
<i>invention. It's called a napkin.</i>

61
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,445
<i>Well, we'll take a station break</i>
<i>and continue with more action.</i>

62
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,618
Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, huh?

63
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,014
Pendant Publishing,
that's books, right?

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,187
Miss?

65
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,728
-Pardon me?
-Books. That's what you do?

66
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,593
Yeah.

67
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,532
Yeah, l don't read much myself.
Well, you know, besides the paper.

68
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,674
Yeah, a lot of people read to relax.
Not me.

69
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,638
You know what l do?

70
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,406
You know, l'm having a lot of trouble
hearing you back here, so<i>....</i>

71
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,641
l said, you know what l do
when l want to relax?

72
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,916
The jumble.

73
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,148
Hey, do you make a book
of jumbles?

74
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,815
l'm gonna have to be
honest with you.

75
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,962
l'm going deaf.

76
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,256
-Going deaf?
-What?

77
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,429
Oh, l<i>....</i> l'm sorry.

78
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,695
lt can be very frustrating.

79
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,362
Hey, what about a hearing aid?

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,670
Am l fearing AlDS? Oh, yeah, sure.
Who isn't?

81
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,177
But, you know,
you gotta live your life.

82
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,145
No, no, no. l said--

83
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,682
Forget it.

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,260
l can't take my eyes
off this lineswoman.

85
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,454
The woman is absolutely
mesmerizing.

86
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,998
-Boy, you are really smitten.
-l gotta talk to her.

87
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,931
-What do you think?
-Cold?

88
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,571
How you gonna do that?
You're not one of those guys.

89
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:11,073
l'll psych myself into it like those
people that walk across the hot coals.

90
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,907
But they're not mocked and humiliated
when they get to the other side.

91
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,140
l have to. l won't be able
to live with myself.

92
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,285
Wait. Jerry, there's
a bigger issue here.

93
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,046
lf you go through that wall
and become one of those guys...

94
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,416
...l'll be left here on this side.

95
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,057
-Take me with you.
-l can't.

96
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,022
What are you gonna say?

97
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,666
l don't know. ''Hi.''

98
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,164
You think you're going
to the other side with ''hi''?

99
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,330
You're not gonna make it.

100
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,310
-<i>Base to 92, come in.</i>
-Yeah, this is 92.

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,347
<i>Yeah, after this, go back</i>
<i>to the city for a 6:00 pickup.</i>

102
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,608
Rightio.

103
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,844
<i>7 49 Bleeker.</i>
<i>The party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.</i>

104
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,687
Tom Hanks?

105
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,690
After me, you're picking up
Tom Hanks? l love him.

106
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,890
So l guess your hearing
goes in and out, huh?

107
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,767
-Yeah. Yes, it--
-Yeah, you know what l think?

108
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,903
l think you made
that whole thing up.

109
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,198
-No, no. l--
-Yeah, yeah. l know your type.

110
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,366
You're too good to make conversation
with someone like me.

111
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,001
Oh, God forbid you
could discuss the jumbles.

112
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,007
But to go so far as to pretend
you're almost deaf?

113
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,050
l mean, that is
truly disgusting, miss.

114
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,710
And Mr. Tom Hanks--

115
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:33,515
May l say he, too, would be
disgusted by your behavior.

116
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,664
Excuse me.

117
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,395
Excuse me.

118
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,057
Oh, that's nice.

119
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,296
That's right, ignore me.
That's real polite.

120
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,908
Yeah, nobody's even talking to you.
Oh, you're a big lineswoman.

121
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,739
Oh, like that's some kind
of a cool job. l know your type.

122
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,643
Think you're too good for everyone.
But it's women like you--

123
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,341
Oh, well-- What, are you deaf?

124
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,250
Bingo.

125
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,994
-And you're saying she's deaf?
-l'm not saying she's deaf. She's deaf.

126
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,097
-Can't hear a thing.
-Can't hear a thing.

127
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,665
-You're gonna go out with her?
-lsn't that something?

128
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,926
-Hey.
-Hi.

129
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,195
-Yeah, you know, l know how to sign.
-Really?

130
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,636
When l was 8, l had a deaf cousin
who lived with us for about a year.

131
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:26,006
Of course, you know, l haven't
been able to do it in a while.

132
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,203
What is this about?

133
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,844
l met this deaf lineswoman
at the tennis match.

134
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,281
You are kidding. That is amazing.

135
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,515
l just took a car service from work.

136
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,782
To get the driver not to talk to me,
l pretended l was going deaf.

137
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,161
-Good plan.
-lt didn't work. He caught me hearing.

138
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,829
All right. lt's terrible,
but l'm not terrible.

139
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,192
-No.
-No.

140
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,063
No. When l shoo squirrels away,
l always say, ''Get out of here.''

141
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,263
l never, ever throw things at them
and try to injure them...

142
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,135
-...like other people.
-That's nice.

143
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,540
Yeah. And when l see freaks in the
street, l never, ever stare at them.

144
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,373
And yet l'm careful
not to look away.

145
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,142
See, because l wanna make
the freaks feel comfortable.

146
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,449
-That's nice for the freaks.
-Yeah.

147
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,680
l don't pouf my hair when l go
to the movies...

148
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,222
...so people behind me can see.

149
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,724
l gotta make it up to this guy.
l won't be able to live with myself.

150
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,363
-What can l do?
-Why don't you get him some tickets.

151
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,829
-Your friend works at a ticket agency.
-Yeah. Pete.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,991
-He can get you tickets to something.
-Really?

153
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,898
Like a rock concert.
Whatever you like.

154
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,268
-Oh, great. Thanks, Kramer.
-Yeah. You got it.

155
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,535
Hey, Jerry, do me a favor.
Next time you see that lineswoman...

156
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,179
...ask her how those ball boys
get those jobs.

157
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,076
l would love to be able to do that.

158
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,015
l think perhaps you've overlooked
one of the key aspects of this activity.

159
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:45,590
lt's ball boys, not ball men.
There are no ball men.

160
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,921
l think he's right.
l've never seen a ball man.

161
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,531
-Well, there ought to be ball men.
-All right, l'll talk to her.

162
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:57,101
You wanna be a ball man, go ahead.
Break the ball barrier. Hey!

163
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,604
A friend of mine from work said
she saw George at the tennis match...

164
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,265
-...on TV yesterday.
-Yeah. Yeah, me too.

165
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,378
He was at the snack bar
eating a hot fudge sundae.

166
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,947
He had it all over his face.

167
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,482
He's wearing that chocolate
on his face like a beard.

168
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,917
And they got in there
really nice and tight, and he's:

169
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,085
-l'm sorry, George.
-But...

170
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,128
...l don't understand.
Things were going so great.

171
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,624
What happened?
Something must've happened.

172
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,262
lt's not you. lt's me.

173
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,301
You're giving me
the ''it's not you, it's me'' routine?

174
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:41,174
l invented ''it's not you, it's me.''
Nobody tells me it's them, not me.

175
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,009
-lf it's anybody, it's me.
-All right.

176
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,778
-George, it's you.
-You are damn right it's me.

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,748
-l was just trying to--
-l know what you were trying to do.

178
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,256
-Nobody does it better than me.
-l'm sure you do it very well.

179
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,091
Yes, well, unfortunately, you'll never
get the chance to find out.

180
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,869
-But l thought things were going great.
-Yeah, so did l.

181
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,136
-Did she say why?
-No.

182
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,536
She tried to give me
the ''it's not you, it's me'' routine.

183
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,072
-But that's your routine.
-Yeah.

184
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,877
Well, apparently word's out.

185
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,484
Hey. Hey, Georgie,
l saw you on TV yesterday.

186
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,222
Really? At the tennis match?

187
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,055
Yeah. You were at the snack bar
eating the hot fudge sundae.

188
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,720
Get out of here.
l didn't see any cameras there.

189
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,366
Oh, the camera was...there.

190
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,697
And the announcers, they made
a couple of cracks about you.

191
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,467
Cracks?

192
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,503
What were they saying?

193
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,577
That you had ice cream
all over your face.

194
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,976
They were talking about
how funny you looked.

195
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,879
Oh, my God. Maybe Gwen saw it.
Maybe that's what did it.

196
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,452
Well, l'll tell you,
it wasn't a pretty sight.

197
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,548
She must've seen me
eating it on TV.

198
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,057
She sees you with hot fudge
on your face and ends it?

199
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:06,358
-You think she'd be that superficial?
-Why not? l would be.

200
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,329
Hello? Oh, hi, Dad.

201
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,132
You saw him?

202
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,509
Really, with the ice cream?
All right, l'll talk to you later. Bye.

203
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,236
-Your parents saw me on TV?
-Yeah.

204
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,608
This is a nightmare.
Kramer, how long was l on?

205
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,716
lt felt like eight seconds.

206
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,648
One-1 000. Two-1 000.
Three-1 000--

207
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,688
l heard you really inhaled that thing.
Did anyone tape it?

208
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,350
Can we move on?

209
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,026
-What?
-He thinks Gwen broke up with him...

210
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,721
...because she saw him
eating the ice cream on TV.

211
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,527
Come on. lf she's that superficial,
you don't want her.

212
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,863
Yes, l do.

213
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,870
l guess you're not going
to Todd's party on Friday.

214
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,942
Well, l can't now.
Gwen's gonna be there.

215
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,976
She should be the one
that shouldn't go.

216
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,604
lf a couple breaks up with plans to go
to a neutral place, who withdraws?

217
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,183
-What's the etiquette?
-Excellent question.

218
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,013
l mean, l think she should withdraw.

219
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,522
She's the breaker. He's the breakee.
He needs to get on with his life.

220
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,125
-l beg to differ.
-Really?

221
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,325
He's the loser.

222
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:19,494
She's the victor. To the victor
belong the spoils.

223
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,072
Well, l don't care.
l don't want to go anyway.

224
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,232
l don't wanna fight that traffic
on Friday.

225
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,037
We can take my office's car service.

226
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,907
-Really?
-Yeah. They don't know.

227
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,741
-All right. l'll see you later.
-Okay.

228
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,645
-Hey, Georgie, you coming?
-Yeah.

229
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,953
''To the victor go the spoils.''

230
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,086
What are you doing tonight?

231
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,592
l got a date with Laura,
the lineswoman.

232
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,294
Why?

233
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,632
-What are you doing?
-l was just gonna wander the streets.

234
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:56,332
l don't want to tag along with you
or anything.

235
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,608
You wanted to come with us?

236
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,211
Jerry, please.

237
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,407
lt's very nice, but<i>....</i>

238
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,711
Where would we be going?

239
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,952
So l've got ice cream all over my face.
There were no napkins there.

240
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,154
Whoever is responsible for stocking
that concession stand...

241
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,855
...cost me a relationship.

242
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,194
-They never have napkins there.
-Let's get the check.

243
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,297
ls this considered signing? Do you
do this when you ask for the check?

244
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,809
Really? l know a sign.
That's my first sign.

245
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,684
That couple is breaking up.

246
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,050
They're breaking up?

247
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,486
-How do you know?
-She reads lips.

248
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,388
What are they saying now?

249
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,758
''lt's not you. lt's me.''

250
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,263
Oh, my God.

251
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,771
l just had a great idea.

252
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,202
She could come to the party tomorrow
and read Gwen's lips for me.

253
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,679
What?

254
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,677
We bring her to the party...

255
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,322
...and she tells me what Gwen
is saying about me.

256
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,825
She's not a novelty act, George...

257
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,588
...that you hire out for weddings
and bar mitzvahs.

258
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,426
Look, it's a skill, just like juggling.

259
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,434
She probably enjoys showing it off.

260
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:37,599
l don't know, George.
l'm not sure about this.

261
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,171
Would you ask her? Just ask her.

262
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,846
-lf she says no, case closed.
-All right.

263
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:53,554
-Laura, George was wondering if--
-Sure. l'll do it.

264
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,224
-So l really had a good time.
-Yeah, me too.

265
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,923
-Wanna go to the party on Friday?
-Yeah.

266
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,160
All right, we're taking a car service.

267
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,361
So we'll swing by and pick you up.

268
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,566
How about 6?

269
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,733
Six is good.

270
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,302
You got a problem with 6?

271
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,978
What? What?

272
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,025
Okay, listen up, people.

273
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,424
There are plenty of you here,
but we've only got two spots to fill.

274
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,087
So good luck.

275
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:37,361
Hey, pops, isn't there a better way
to spend your twilight years?

276
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,995
Well, l may be old, but l'm spry.

277
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,041
The tryout lasts three and a half
to four hours.

278
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,044
-Are you up for it?
-Oh, l'll be up for it, punk.

279
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,293
See, l was saying ''six,''
but she thought l was saying ''sex.''

280
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,197
We straightened
the whole thing out.

281
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,463
-She confused ''six'' with ''sex''?
-Yeah.

282
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,308
lf she can't tell ''six'' from ''sex,'' how's
she gonna lip read across a room?

283
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,207
-''Six'' and ''sex'' are close.
-lt's two completely different sounds:

284
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,870
And:

285
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,014
lt seems like a problem.

286
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,245
Well, l'm not dating
any other deaf women.

287
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,756
Hey, guess who's gonna be
the new ball man for the finals?

288
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,085
-You're kidding.
-Yeah.

289
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,160
They said they never saw anybody
go after balls with such gusto.

290
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,957
-When is that car service coming?
-Five minutes.

291
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,226
lt's gonna pick us up, then Elaine.
Laura's gonna meet us there.

292
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,838
lf this lip-reading thing works tonight,
you know how incredible it'll be?

293
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,237
-lt's like having Superman for a friend.
-l know. lt's like x-ray vision.

294
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,436
lf we could just harness this power
and use it for our own personal gain...

295
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,877
-...there'd be no stopping us.
-Hey, hey, hey.

296
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,576
l hear you got some lip reader
working for you. Let me use her once.

297
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,311
-Can't do it, Newman.
-But, Jerry...

298
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,615
...we got this new supervisor
at the post office.

299
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,190
He's working behind glass.
They're talking about me.

300
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,726
They're gonna transfer me. l know it!
Two hours. Give me two hours.

301
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,955
lt's not gonna happen!

302
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,901
All right. All right.
All right, you go ahead.

303
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,061
You go ahead. You keep it secret.
But you remember this:

304
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:25,871
When you control the mail,
you control information.

305
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,472
Just pull over right by
that stop sign.

306
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,311
-Pardon me, sir?
-l said, pull over by the stop sign.

307
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,081
Oh, sorry. You'll have to forgive me.
l can't hear a damn thing.

308
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,623
Went to a rock concert
last night at the Garden.

309
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,220
My seats were right up
against the speaker.

310
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,456
lt's a heavy metal group,
Metalli-something.

311
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,622
Ca.

312
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,462
-What?
-Ca.

313
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,070
My ears are still ringing.

314
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,902
Some woman's idea of a joke.

315
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,139
-Hey.
-Hi.

316
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,080
-Get out. Get out!
-We'll never get there.

317
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,239
-Go on!
-Okay.

318
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,216
Hey! Shut the door.

319
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:19,261
The whole idea of the car service
was so l wouldn't have to fight traffic.

320
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,726
l know, l'm late. Hey,
now l know two signs.

321
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,870
''Check'' and ''late.''

322
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,064
Hey, this is my friend you helped
become the first ball man.

323
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,538
Congratulations.

324
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,310
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

325
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,954
Guys, you made it.

326
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,920
-Hey.
-Hey, buddy.

327
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,119
-Hey, Todd.
-Sorry to hear about Gwen.

328
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,163
Why, did she say something
about why she broke up with me?

329
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,063
No. Tonight will be the first chance
l've had to talk to her.

330
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,733
Really?

331
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,963
Look, George,
l'm friends with both of you...

332
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,543
...but l can't betray her confidence
by telling you anything.

333
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:10,114
l wouldn't hear of it, Todd.
lt's none of my business.

334
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,376
But you should try and find out
everything you possibly can.

335
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,352
ln fact, l'll even stay all the way
over on the other side of the room...

336
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,152
...just so there's no chance
of me overhearing anything.

337
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,489
-You are so centered.
-Hey.

338
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,494
l've grown up.

339
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,793
Oh, my God. There she is.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

340
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,400
-Let's go, let's go. Get in position.
-What?

341
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,868
All right, all right.
What are they saying?

342
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,071
-''Hi, Gwen.'' ''Hi, Tide.''
-High tide?

343
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,373
''Hi, Todd.''

344
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,413
''You got something
between your teeth.''

345
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,519
-Where?
-No, that's what he said.

346
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,083
''That's interesting. l love carrots,
but l hate carrot soup.

347
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,618
And l hate peas,
but l love pea soup.''

348
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,355
-So do l.
-This is so wild.

349
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,362
Can l borrow her
for a few hours tomorrow?

350
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,398
No. Then l'd have to lend her
to everybody.

351
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,336
l don't envy you, Todd.
This place is gonna be a mess.

352
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,202
Maybe you can stick around,
and we can sweep together.

353
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,776
''Why don't you stick around,
and we can sleep together.''

354
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,141
-What?
-''You want me to sleep with you?''

355
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,284
-l don't wanna sweep alone.
-He says, ''l don't wanna sleep alone.''

356
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,784
And she says-- Oh, boy.
''Love to.''

357
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,786
All right, that's it.

358
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,888
You get rid of me, now the two
of you are gonna sleep together?

359
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,393
-What? You're crazy.
-''What? You're crazy.''

360
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,555
-l heard your whole conversation.
-How?

361
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,994
-''How?''
-l can read lips.

362
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,970
-You said, ''Let's sleep together.''
-No, l didn't. l said ''sweep.''

363
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,438
Let's sweep together,
like with a broom.

364
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,804
-Cleaning up.
-''Cleaning up.''

365
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,206
Sweep?

366
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,971
-Yes. Sweep.
-''Yes. Sweep.''

367
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,637
-Cut it.
-George says, ''Cut it.''

368
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,840
-Cut it.
-George says--

369
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,645
Cut it. Would you stop signing?!

370
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,015
-What?
-They said ''sweep together,'' idiots.

371
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,157
Not ''sleep together.''

372
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,917
Look, l know how to sign.

373
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,427
My eye! My eye!

374
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,426
This is really amazing, getting to see
Monica Seles play in the finals.

375
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,469
l know. And in the first tournament
of her comeback.

376
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,290
Thus ends the great
ball man experiment.

377
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,972
-You with the tennis center?
-Yeah.

378
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,304
Hey, how about that ball man
injuring Monica Seles?

379
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,639
-Wasn't that something?
-l'm deaf.

380
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,792
l've always been a big fan
of the little check move, you know?

381
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,461
''Can l get the check? The check.''

382
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,466
Unless the waiter's not too sharp.
Then you gotta total it up.

383
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,898
<i>''I want the check. ''</i>

384
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,600
They come over,
''Do you want the check?''

385
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,708
''No, l want to be pen pals.
Can't you see what l'm doing here?

386
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,243
l'm trying to be cool
and impress people.''
