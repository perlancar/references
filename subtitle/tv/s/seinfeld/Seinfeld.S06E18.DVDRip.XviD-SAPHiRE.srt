1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,926
Remember the doorman strike?

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,039
They have a union,
in the fancy buildings...

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,469
...and they went on strike.

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,735
You would think if any group of people
would not wanna demonstrate...

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,007
...what life would be like without them,
it would be doormen.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,480
"Let's see how they do without us."

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,353
There's no doorman,
people open the door, they walk in.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,354
Who's gonna walk out next?

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,621
The guys that clean your windshield
at the traffic light with the dirty rag?

10
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,732
"We demand shorter yellows
and longer reds."

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,572
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,578
I'm just going up
to see Elaine Benes.

13
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,718
Benes. There's no one here
by that name.

14
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,550
Oh, she's housesitting for Mr. Pitt.

15
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,451
- Oh, housesitting?
- Yeah.

16
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,455
What are you, the boyfriend?

17
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,992
Here for a quickie?

18
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,990
- Can I just go up?
- Oh, I get it.

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,397
Why waste time making small talk
with the doorman?

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,061
I should just shut up and do my job
opening the door for you.

21
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,757
How about those Knicks?

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,991
Oh, I see, on the sports page.

23
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,595
Why do you think I wasrt
reading the Wall Street page?

24
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,324
Oh, I know. Because I'm
the uneducated doorman.

25
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,968
So you think your parents
will get back together?

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,631
I hope so. I can't take him
living with me much longer.

27
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,403
He makes this kasha,
it stinks up the whole house.

28
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,979
- Hey, George, stick them up.
- What?

29
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,844
For these German tourists.
Pretend that I'm robbing you.

30
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,583
- Why?
- So these people can go back home...

31
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,347
...and tell their friends they saw
a real New York mugging.

32
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,047
It'll give them a thrill.

33
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,658
All right, hands up, porky.

34
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,223
That's it.
Now, give me your wallet.

35
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,228
You got it in here, huh, fat boy?

36
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,592
Is that all you got, huh?
Is that all you got?

37
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,363
- All right, that's enough.
- I'll tell you when it's enough.

38
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,836
All right, you better not say anything
or I'll stalk you.

39
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,707
Where have you been?
We're gonna miss the movie. Let's go.

40
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:34,013
I am not going back down there.
I can't face that guy again.

41
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,916
- What guy?
- The doorman.

42
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,080
I don't wanna play any more
of his mind games.

43
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,987
- What time does he get off?
- Six.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,220
But then the night doorman comes on.
He's much scarier.

45
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,465
Well, it's almost 6 now.
Can't we just wait till he goes home?

46
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,933
- We'll still make the movie.
- Okay, okay.

47
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,610
So, what did you do today, Dad?

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,840
Today I went record shopping
in Greenwich Village.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,918
I bought this record,
but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.

50
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,485
I don't have a hi-fi.

51
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,055
- I gave you my old record player.
- I gave it to Cosmo.

52
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,249
Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?

53
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,586
I'm Cosmo.

54
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,730
Well, I want it back.
I want to listen to that cha-cha record.

55
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,964
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,625
All right, all right.
Can we go out and eat?

57
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,431
Let me change my shirt.

58
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,541
Jerry, it's 6, let's go.

59
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,014
That doormars
still milling around outside.

60
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,585
He's very peculiar.

61
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,518
- No, don't...
- Hello.

62
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,026
- Oh, hi, Mr. Pitt.
- Give that to me.

63
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,460
Hello, Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?

64
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,395
Elaine, are you having a party?

65
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,333
A party? Oh, no, that was
just my stupid friend, Jerry.

66
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,766
He just left. We can go.

67
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,237
There's to be no entertaining
while I'm gone.

68
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,808
Believe me, we're not entertained.
We're just leaving.

69
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,141
- Grab those empty bottles for me.
- I need to know what's in the mail.

70
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,147
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really
nothing that can't wait.

71
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,184
- We're trying to catch a movie.
- Well, catch the later show.

72
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,185
I need to know what's in the mail.

73
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,748
All right.

74
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,992
I can't go.

75
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,930
The new TIME magazine.

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,775
- The new People.
- Oh, who's on the cover?

77
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,641
Hey, buddy.

78
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,838
You? What are you doing here?
You work at this building too?

79
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,008
Oh, sure.

80
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,914
Poor doorman has to work
two jobs...

81
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,817
...to put food on the table
for mother and baby.

82
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,753
No, I live here.

83
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,458
That's okay, isn't it?

84
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,425
So you work all day as a doorman
at one building...

85
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,531
...and then you stand outside
your building?

86
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,463
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

87
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,264
Look, I'm not going in your building.
I really don't have to talk to you.

88
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,701
Goodbye.

89
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,473
You really think
you're better than me, don't you?

90
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,078
So my father opened his shirt...

91
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,979
- Yeah, and?
- Tell him, Kramer.

92
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,544
He had breasts.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,495
- What do you mean, breasts?
- Big breasts.

94
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,831
So what?
A lot of older men have that.

95
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,968
No, not these.
These were real hooters.

96
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,141
I was throwing up all night.

97
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,703
It was like my own personal
Crying Game.

98
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,380
You know, maybe you're
gonna get them too, George.

99
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,389
Yeah, that's right.

100
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,924
What if it's a genetic thing?
Like father, like son.

101
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,459
But your father's not bald.

102
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,220
No, no. That skips a generation.

103
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,558
The baldness gene
comes from your grandfather.

104
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,066
Then I suppose the bosom gene
comes from your grandmother?

105
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,567
Frank can't be too comfortable
with those things clanging around.

106
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,609
He should wear something
for support.

107
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,979
- You mean, like a bra?
- No, a bra is for ladies.

108
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,446
I'm talking about
a support undergarment...

109
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,609
...specifically designed for men.

110
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,421
Boy, that brain never
stops working, does it?

111
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,553
That's right.
I'm gonna go noodle with this.

112
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,097
Hey, we're twins.

113
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,497
What?!

114
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,962
Our shirts, they're the same.

115
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,106
Imagine that.

116
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,342
What? What did you say
to the doorman?

117
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,839
What? Nothing.

118
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:00,418
He claims that you followed him home
and started harassing him.

119
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,986
What, does this guy got
a personal vendetta with me?

120
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,750
What did I do to him? Because
I asked him about the Knicks?

121
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,415
- Hey, did you make the movie?
- No.

122
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,390
You wanna go tonight?
You can pick me up.

123
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,998
All right. Can we go to a later show
so he's off his shift when I come by?

124
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,296
So now we have to rearrange our lives
to avoid the doorman?

125
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,597
Yes, we do.

126
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,336
What is wrong with George?

127
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,010
He's trying to get something
off his chest.

128
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,017
All right. I gotta try and talk my mother
into taking him off my hands.

129
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,949
Help you?

130
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,860
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be gone.

131
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,592
I traded shifts with the night doorman.
He had personal affairs to attend to.

132
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,895
My fellow doormen and I
watch out for each other.

133
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,062
We don't stab each other in the back
like people in your world.

134
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,537
Look, I don't want any trouble.

135
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,908
I don't have a doorman in my building.
I guess I'm not used to talking to them.

136
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,845
- I'd really just like to be friends.
- You wanna be friends?

137
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,946
I'd like to be.

138
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,950
- Then watch the door for a minute.
- What?

139
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,214
I just want to get a beer.
Be back in a minute.

140
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,790
- Wait a second. What do I do?
- It's not brain surgery.

141
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,157
Open the door for people.
If they don't live here, don't let them in.

142
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,627
Here.

143
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,560
Wear this.

144
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,774
Hey, hey, wait a second.

145
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,245
Hey! Hello!

146
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,212
- Wait a second, you live here?
- Of course I live here.

147
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,252
I've lived here for 20 years.
Now, if you don't let me in...

148
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,823
...I'm going to call the police
and have you arrested.

149
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,252
All right. All right.

150
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,894
You think you're better than me?

151
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,123
- You gotta sign for it.
- Oh, right, right.

152
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,834
Hey, how about those Knicks, huh?

153
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,107
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

154
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,588
Hey, I brought back
your record player.

155
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,193
Oh, thank you, Kramer.
Put it over there.

156
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,930
Oh, boy. Yeah.

157
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,624
- So how you feeling?
- A little tired.

158
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,829
- Does your back hurt?
- How did you know?

159
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,463
Well, it's obvious. You're carrying
a lot of extra baggage up there.

160
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,872
- Up here?
- Oh, yeah, top floor.

161
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,139
Listen, Frank...

162
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,714
...you ever considered
wearing something for support?

163
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,720
Now, look at this.
Mind you, this is just a prototype.

164
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,650
- You want me to wear a bra?
- No, no.

165
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:28,385
A bra is for ladies.
Meet the Bro.

166
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,394
So is your father excited
about coming home?

167
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,164
George.

168
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,865
Hey, Mom, what kind of woman
was Grandma?

169
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,637
All of a sudden you're interested
in your grandmother?

170
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,803
Well, you know,
you get to a certain point...

171
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,846
...you want to know
about your roots.

172
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,978
- Well, she was a lovely woman.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,912
- What about physically?
- Physically?

174
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,548
- You know, what did she look like?
- Well, you've seen pictures.

175
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,718
Well, you can't tell much
from those pictures.

176
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,693
Tell what?

177
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,929
Was she...?

178
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,300
- Was she a big woman?
- Big? No.

179
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,997
She was my height.

180
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,939
- Bosomy?
- Bosomy?

181
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,376
You want to know
if your grandmother was bosomy?

182
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,175
I was just wondering.
The information could be relevant.

183
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,912
Where do you get your genes from?

184
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,249
That's what I'd like to know.

185
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,424
- I can't believe you left your post.
- He left me there.

186
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,426
You see the mind games?

187
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,595
Hey, what's going on here?

188
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,101
Somebody stole the couch
out of the lobby.

189
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,802
Where's the doorman?

190
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,806
How come someone wasrt
watching the door?

191
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,176
- Jerry, let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,758
Oh, my God.

193
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,969
- Why were you watching the door?
- He asked me to.

194
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,805
We were getting along.

195
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,379
You know, my fingerprints
are all over this.

196
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,413
That doorman knows
you're a friend of mine.

197
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,745
He'll tell that co-op lady.
She'll tell Mr. Pitt.

198
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,251
Jerry, I'm in this too deep.

199
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,750
Don't you find it odd that as soon
as he leaves, a couch gets stolen?

200
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,052
- Maybe he's setting me up.
- All right. Shut up.

201
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,253
Just let me think. I gotta think.

202
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,096
We gotta get our story straight.

203
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,597
- All right. What if we say...?
- All right. Here it is.

204
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,065
This is what we'll tell them.

205
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,466
- You came to pick me up.
- I came to pick you up.

206
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,032
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- No, I was just...

207
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,541
- No, I know. It's not helping.
- All right. Well, just start again.

208
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,807
- Okay. You came to pick me up...
- Right.

209
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,846
- You see? Again.
- What? I said, "Right."

210
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,119
All right, you came right upstairs
without talking to the doorman.

211
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,088
But the doormars gonna
say I was there.

212
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,956
So what? No one's gonna
believe a doorman.

213
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,662
- I don't know if this is gonna work.
- Stick with the story. We'll be fine.

214
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,323
- Let me do the talking.
- Okay.

215
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,162
Good. Now fix me a drink.

216
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,734
How's that feel?

217
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,908
- This feels very comfortable.
- You see?

218
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,669
- I feel 10 years younger.
- And your posture's a lot better.

219
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,937
Look at you.

220
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,104
- And I can breathe easier too.
- I told you.

221
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,011
Frank, listen,
here's what I'm thinking.

222
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,312
- You have a friend in the bra business.
- Of course. Sid Farkus.

223
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,852
He's the best in the business.

224
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:47,322
It's our chance. What do you say?
It'll be me, you and the Bro, bro.

225
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,321
Let's do it.

226
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,596
Except we gotta do something
about the name.

227
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,494
- Why? What's wrong with Bro?
- Bro is no good. Too ethnic.

228
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,761
- You got something better?
- How about the...

229
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,671
The Mansiere.

230
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,036
- Mansiere?
- That's right.

231
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,237
A brassiere for a man.

232
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,903
The Mansiere. Get it?

233
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,443
Well, you scared her off.

234
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,916
We may never see Mom again.

235
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:20,787
Hey, George, what do you like better,
the Bro or the Mansiere?

236
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:30,393
Dad, we need to talk.

237
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,766
I had to use the bathroom...

238
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,533
...so I asked this guy to watch
the door for a few minutes.

239
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,143
Why should I believe you?

240
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,072
Actually, it was her friend.

241
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:48,746
I was just speaking to the doorman
here about the couch robbery.

242
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,947
Oh, really? The doorman.

243
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,725
And pray tell,
what did the doorman say?

244
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,455
He said he asked a friend of yours
to watch the door.

245
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,996
Oh, my.

246
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,499
Well, the doorman certainly has
a wild imagination, doesn't he?

247
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,138
Well, what do we have here?

248
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,137
Perhaps Ms. Benes can explain...

249
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,802
...why a Jerry Seinfeld signed
for this package...

250
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,846
...at the exact same time
the couch was stolen.

251
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,752
He'd never watched
a door before, Mrs. Payton.

252
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,218
He didn't know how to do it.

253
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,186
You know, he's a comedian,
Mrs. Payton.

254
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,552
They don't know how
to do anything.

255
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,555
Don't you see what's going on here?
He set us up.

256
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,858
He's playing all these mind games.

257
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,133
- They're saying I'm responsible?
- There was nothing I could do.

258
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,934
He had a Federal Express slip
with your signature on it.

259
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,869
Diabolical.

260
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,140
He thought of everything.
He was setting me up from day one.

261
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,782
Is it possible we were victims
of a sting?

262
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,352
I'm sure he's having a good laugh
over this with his doorman buddies.

263
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,986
So you didn't even want the couch?

264
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,992
No, I was just messing
with his head.

265
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,989
And they think
they're better than us.

266
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,134
Anyway, Jerry... Jerry.

267
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,796
- We have to replace the couch.
- Now we have to buy a new couch?

268
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,773
Not necessarily.

269
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,002
Why don't you take back
the couch you gave me?

270
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,375
- The one with the Poppie stain?
- Yeah, sure.

271
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,608
Then my father will have
no place to sleep.

272
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,752
He's gotta move out.

273
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,512
But it's got a pee stain on it.

274
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,747
Well, the cushiors turned over.

275
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,789
- I guess.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,859
You get a couch,
I get rid of my father.

277
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,518
It couldn't be more perfect.

278
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,689
- Now, it's call the Bro.
- Or the Mansiere.

279
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,529
- Yeah, but I prefer the Bro.
- I like Mansiere.

280
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:49,231
Well, I have to tell you,
it's a very interesting idea.

281
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,036
You know, selling bras
exclusively to women...

282
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,442
...we're really only utilizing
50 percent of the market.

283
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,411
- That's what we figured.
- I told you.

284
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,952
And to be perfectly frank, I've always
felt I could use some support.

285
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,317
I know when I'm wearing Ban-Lon...

286
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,787
...there appears to be some jiggling.

287
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,821
I wouldn't be caught dead
in Ban-Lon.

288
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,588
So, what do you see in the back?
Hooks? Velcro?

289
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,792
- Definitely Velcro.
- Oh, yeah.

290
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,870
Say you're getting intimate
with a woman...

291
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,701
...you don't want her fumbling
and struggling back there.

292
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,202
I think we've all experienced that.

293
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,251
Summer nights.

294
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,593
I still have to talk about this
to Mr. De Granmont...

295
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,751
...but barring any unforeseen
developments...

296
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,056
...gentlemen, I think
we're sitting on a winner.

297
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,220
Good.

298
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,459
Frank, I wanna tell you
how sorry I am...

299
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,729
...to hear about you and Estelle
separating.

300
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,770
Thank you, Sid,
but that's all in the past.

301
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,771
I'm ready to move on.

302
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,706
I've always been very fond
of Estelle.

303
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,903
Beautiful woman.

304
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,842
I hope you don't think
this is out of line...

305
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,816
...but would it be okay with you
if I were to ask her out?

306
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,013
You want to go out with my wife?

307
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,022
Where do you get the nerve
to ask me that?

308
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,182
No, I'm just saying...

309
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,351
I know what you're saying
and thinking.

310
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,757
- No, Frank...
- Come on, Cosmo.

311
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,059
- I'm not doing business with this guy.
- Come on. Frank. Frank!

312
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,826
Frank!

313
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,438
- Jerry took the couch back.
- He took it back?

314
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,770
- Didrt you tell him I was using it?
- Oh, I pleaded with him.

315
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,300
Where do I sleep?

316
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,743
Well, I took the liberty
of packing your things.

317
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,643
Mom's coming to get you.

318
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,115
I thought Jerry didn't want
that couch because of the stain.

319
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,913
- What stain?
- Oh, you didn't notice?

320
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,113
It has a pee stain.

321
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,425
You had me sleeping
on a pee-stained couch?

322
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,152
No.

323
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,456
No, no. The cushion
was turned over.

324
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,794
But the very idea.
You had me lying in urine!

325
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,871
There's Mom. There's Mom.

326
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,072
- Is it safe to come in?
- Oh, of course. Of course.

327
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,508
You're not having any
of your transvestite parties?

328
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,805
Will you stop it?

329
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,173
I lived with him for 40 years.

330
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,511
I never saw him trying on
my underwear.

331
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:18,782
As soon as he leaves the house,
he turns into J. Edgar Hoover.

332
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,391
Here, Cosmo, you can have the hi-fi.
I don't need it now.

333
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,498
- I got one at home.
- All right. Let's go.

334
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,534
- We'll go out for dinner tonight.
- I can't tonight. I'm busy.

335
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:32,863
What do you mean, busy?

336
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,007
- I'm having dinner with someone.
- With whom?

337
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,167
Sid Farkus.

338
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,107
Sid Farkus?

339
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,339
You're not having dinner
with a bra salesman.

340
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,144
Hey, he only sells them,
he doesn't wear them.

341
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,322
Okay. That's it.
I'm not coming home.

342
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,783
But you can't stay here.
There's no place to sleep.

343
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,393
We'll work something out.

344
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,368
Stop him!

345
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,635
Yeah, yeah, it's him.

346
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,076
Stop that man! It's him!

347
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,614
Somebody stop him!

348
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,984
Please, quick.

349
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,917
Stop! It's him! I know. I know.

350
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,182
Help! Stop him!

351
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,223
Hey, that record player
is not yours.

352
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,090
- No, look, somebody gave it to me.
- You're a thief. We have proof.

353
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,357
What is that?

354
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,099
It's the first upper-body
support undergarment...

355
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,828
...specifically designed for men.

356
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,132
How does it connect in the back?
With a hook?

357
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,674
Oh, no, no, no. Here. Velcro.

358
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,720
Well, I suppose it will have to do.

359
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,325
- It's a beautiful couch.
- It's hardly been used.

360
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,724
Poppie.

361
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,763
Oh, hello, Jerry.

362
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,992
- What are you doing here?
- Visiting my friend.

363
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,501
- Hey, how you feeling?
- Much better. Much better.

364
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,699
The doctors are saying
I cannot have no aggravation...

365
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,106
...so I sell the restaurant.

366
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,543
I just take it easy.

367
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:27,879
See, if I get excited,
that's aggravated my condition.

368
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:32,251
The last time I got aggravated
was in the restaurant...

369
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,119
...with your friend.

370
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,820
She started a big fight
about abortion.

371
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,958
It's you.

372
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,726
- It's you.
- What?

373
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:47,099
You... l... l...

374
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,330
I gotta sit down.

375
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,566
- No, Poppie, no!
- No, Poppie!

376
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,061
Kasha?

377
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,146
No, thanks, Dad.
