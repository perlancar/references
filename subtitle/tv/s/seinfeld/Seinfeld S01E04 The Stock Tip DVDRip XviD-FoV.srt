1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,400
Went to dinner the other night,
check came at the end of the meal.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,800
Never liked the
"check at the end of the meal" system.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,900
Money's a different thing
before you eat.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Before you eat, money has no value.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,100
You don't care
when you're hungry.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,200
You sit down in a restaurant, you're
the ruler of an empire. " More drinks!

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Appetizers! Quickly, quickly.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
It will be the greatest
meal of our lives."

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Then after the meal, you know,
you got the pants open...

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,500
...you got the napkins destroyed...

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,300
...cigarette butt
in the mashed potatoes.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,600
Then the check comes at that moment.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,000
People are always upset, you know?

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,300
They're mystified by the check.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,300
"What is this?

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,000
How could this be?"

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,300
They start passing it around the table,
"Does this look right to you?

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,900
We're not hungry now.
Why are we buying all this food?"

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,300
I think Superman probably has
a very good sense of humour.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,100
I never heard him say anything funny.

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,700
It's common sense.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,100
He's got super strength, super speed.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm sure he's got super humour.

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,900
You would think that, but...

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,100
...either you're born with humour
or you're not. It's not gonna change.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,100
Even if you go
from the red sun of Krypton...

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,400
...all the way to the yellow sun
of the Earth.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Why? Why would that one area
of his mind...

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,600
...not be affected
by the yellow sun of the Earth?

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,700
I don't know. But he ain't funny.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,500
Hi.

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,400
I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,300
No problem.

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,500
I dropped a grape.

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,200
- What?
- I dropped a grape in the kitchen...

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,800
...and it disappeared.

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,800
I couldn't find it. I was... I was
literally on my knees for 10 minutes...

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,800
...looking for this stupid grape.

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,700
I have no idea where it went.

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,000
Were you crying?
I mean, it's just a grape.

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,300
You'll find it.

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,000
No. I'm just getting over
an allergy attack.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,400
- This guy I'm going out with...
- Robert.

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Robert. Yes. Thank you.

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,900
He has two cats,
and I'm allergic to them.

46
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,700
You know, I finally meet
a normal man...

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
...and I can't even go
into his apartment.

48
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,300
Of course, my apartment
is The Actors' Studio...

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,000
...so we can't go there. It's really
causing a lot of problems, you know?

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,900
He won't even go away for
the weekend because of these cats.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Guys with cats... I don't know.

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I been thinking of asking
this girl I'm seeing...

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
Vanessa?

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,500
Vanessa. Thank you.

55
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,200
I been thinking about asking her
to go away a couple days.

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, no. No, no.

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
I'd have to advise against that.

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,400
What do you know this woman,
a month?

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,500
You're gonna be with her 72 hours,
that's a dating decathlon.

60
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Why don't you take her to that place
in Vermont I was telling you about?

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,200
That really charming place with the...

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
...with the separate faucets
for the hot and cold.

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,900
She'll love it.

64
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,900
That's exquisite.
Listen, if it's not too much trouble...

65
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,400
...could you pass me
that paper over there?

66
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
Just the business section.

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,200
You better find that grape before
it mutates into another life form.

68
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,600
There was once a mutant grape...

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,900
...that terrorized an entire town
in the Texas panhandle.

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,900
They brought in the Army.
Nobody could stop it.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,900
Apparently, it had a pit of steel.

72
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Up again. This is incredible.

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
- I'm getting it.
- You're getting what?

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,900
- A stock.
- What stock?

75
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,600
- You ever meet my friend Simons?
- Maybe.

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,100
This guy Wilkenson made a fortune
in the stock market.

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,200
Now he's got some new thing, there
was supposed to be a big merger.

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,300
I wasn't even supposed
to say anything.

79
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
- You should think about this.
- How high is it supposed to go?

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,700
I don't know. But Simons said
if I wanted to get involved...

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,500
...Wilkenson would tell me
the exact right minute to sell.

82
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,800
- You wanna do it?
- Boy, I don't know.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
I don't have any money.

84
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,600
What kind of company is it?

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's called Centrax. They got
some new kind of technique...

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,900
...for televising opera.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Televising opera?

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,300
Some sort of electronic thingy.

89
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
How much are you gonna invest?

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Five thousand. Ten... Ten thousand.

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Five thousand.

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,100
- Boy.
- Come on!

93
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,300
Wilkenson's got millions
invested in this stock.

94
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,900
It's gone up three points
since I've been watching it.

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,200
- What if I lose it?
- Come on! Go for 2500.

96
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,100
We'll do it together.
Come on, come on.

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,900
We're in it together.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
- All right, 2500.
- That's it.

99
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,900
Yeah, can I take your order?

100
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,700
Check to the raiser.

101
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,500
My bet? All right.

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,900
I'll open with the tuna sandwich.

103
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,900
- Tuna?
- Oh, the dolphin thing?

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,600
They're dying in the nets.

105
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,700
You know, the whole concept of lunch
is based on tuna.

106
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,700
Jerry, can't you incorporate one
unselfish act in your daily routine?

107
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,700
Hey, when I'm driving, I let people
in ahead of me all the time.

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,700
I'm always waving everybody in.

109
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,900
"Go ahead. Go ahead."

110
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,800
All right, all right.
I'll have the chicken salad.

111
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,500
And I'm gonna have...

112
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,200
...an English muffin with margarine
on the side, and a cup of coffee.

113
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,500
Okay, what about you?

114
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,100
I'll have the tuna.

115
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,500
I have to say,
those people talking behind us...

116
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,300
...really ruined that movie for me.

117
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,400
Why didn't you do something?

118
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,300
What do you want me to do?

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,000
I gave the guy the half-turn.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,900
Then I gave him the full turn
with the eye roll.

121
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,400
I mean, beyond that,
I'm risking a punch in the mouth.

122
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,400
Excuse me.
Do you have these in the puffs?

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,400
No puffs. Just flakes.

124
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,000
Have you thought any more
about that trip?

125
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,100
Yeah. I've been thinking about it.

126
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,600
You know, my friend told me
about this place in Vermont.

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,600
I don't know. I just worry about
trips like this. It's a lot of pressure.

128
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,700
It's great.
It speeds up the intimacy level.

129
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,600
It's like putting the relationship
in a time compressor.

130
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,900
Where we would be
six months from now...

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
...we accomplish in three days.

132
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,100
So you want to move our relationship
into phase two.

133
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Exactly. I love phase two.

134
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,400
Extra toothbrushes,
increased phone call frequency...

135
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,200
...walking around naked.

136
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,300
You know, the presents get a lot better
in phase two.

137
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
Really?

138
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,100
Can we go fishing up there?

139
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,800
We can fish. What,
blues, carp, marlin?

140
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,300
- Marlin in Vermont?
- Oh.

141
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,600
Big fighting marlin.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
Jerry, the stock is the same
as when you checked earlier.

143
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,000
There are no changes after the market
closes, the stock is still down.

144
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,500
I know, but this is a different paper.
I thought maybe they have different...

145
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,900
...sources.

146
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,300
Is that my paper?

147
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Bad news, my friend.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,100
- What, what news?
- Centrax.

149
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,100
Oh, come on. It's down again?

150
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,300
- Two and a half points.
- Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that.

151
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,500
That's four and a half points
in three days.

152
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,100
- That's almost half my money.
- Hey, I told you.

153
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,200
- Yeah, you told me.
- It's all manipulated with junk bonds.

154
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,400
You can't win.

155
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
There's one thing I don't understand.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Why does it please you?

157
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,900
George Costanza, please.

158
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,700
I'm just telling you
to get rid of that stock now!

159
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,300
George, what's going on?

160
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,300
Sell them! Just say, "I'm selling!"

161
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,800
Well, where is the guy?

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,200
Nothing?
Almost half my money's gone.

163
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,100
Well, call me right back.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,900
Nobody can reach Wilkenson, he
hasn't been in his office in three days.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
I can't believe you put your money
in that Centrax.

166
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,100
You could have invested
in my roll-out tie dispenser.

167
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,700
The roll-out tie dispenser.

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
- What was that?
- Okay. You're in a restaurant.

169
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,700
You got a very big meeting
coming up.

170
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,200
- Okay.
- "Oh, man!"

171
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,100
You got mustard on your tie.

172
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
- Oh, no.
- You just...

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,100
...tear it off and...

174
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
...you got a new one right here.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,900
Then, you're gone.

176
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,000
You're gone, all right.

177
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,400
Hey, where you going?
You gonna take a trip? The map...

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,900
Yeah, I'm going to Vermont
with Vanessa for a few days.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Hey, can I use your place?

180
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800
I got a bunch of friends coming over
this weekend.

181
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,500
- What friends?
- Just people I met at a rock concert.

182
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
You mind if they use your bed?

183
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,200
Because they're good people, Jerry.
You know, they're anarchists.

184
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,900
They're... They're huge.

185
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,100
George, what?

186
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,900
You're kidding.

187
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,200
Well, what's wrong?

188
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,100
So, what are we gonna do?

189
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,000
Great. All right, I'll speak to you later.

190
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,500
Wilkenson, the guy who's supposed
to tell us when to sell the stock...

191
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
...he's in the hospital.

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,900
You don't know what's wrong
with him?

193
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,900
All Simons was able to find out
is that he's in the hospital.

194
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, fine.
Has Simons been in touch with him?

195
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,700
Of course he's been in touch with him.
He left two messages.

196
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,500
He hasn't heard back yet,
that's all.

197
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, this is it. I'm selling.

198
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,500
Just give it a little more time.

199
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,500
I never should've gotten involved
with this, I'm a nervous wreck...

200
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,100
...l'm not cut out for investing.

201
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
All right. That's it.
I'm gonna go down there.

202
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,600
- Where?
- To the hospital.

203
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,700
- The hospital?
- I'm gonna find out what's going on.

204
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,700
Are you nuts?
You don't even know the guy.

205
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,600
So what?
I'll start talking to him, you know...

206
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
...casual, I'll work my way
around to it.

207
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,500
What if he's in an iron lung
or something?

208
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,500
What are you gonna do?

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
"How you feeling, Mr. Wilkenson?

210
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,900
By the way,
what's happening with Centrax?"

211
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,100
Maybe he's there resting.

212
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Who goes to a hospital to rest?

213
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
What are you, a doctor?

214
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,900
Okay, fine.
When are you going down there?

215
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,900
Today. I'm going today.

216
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,700
Just don't do anything
until you hear from me.

217
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
All right.

218
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,700
Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.

219
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,100
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I picked up this shirt yesterday.

220
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
It's completely shrunk.

221
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,100
There's absolutely no way
I can wear it.

222
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,800
- When did you bring it in?
- What's the difference? Look.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,900
Do you see the size of this shirt?

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,100
- You got a receipt?
- I can't find the receipt.

225
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,700
- You should get the receipt.
- Look, forget the receipt.

226
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,700
Even if I had the receipt, look at it.

227
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
It's a hand puppet.

228
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
What am I gonna do with this?

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,400
Yes, but how do I know
we did the shirt?

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,000
What do you think,
this is a little scam I have?

231
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I take this tiny shirt all over the city...

232
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
...conning dry cleaners
out of money?

233
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,400
Forget money.
I don't even want the money.

234
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,400
I just once would like to hear
a dry cleaner admit...

235
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,700
...that something was their fault.
That's what I want.

236
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I want an admission of guilt.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,100
Maybe you asked for it to be washed.

238
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,300
No. Dry-cleaned.

239
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,800
Let me explain
to you something, okay?

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,300
With certain types of fabrics, different
chemicals can react, causing...

241
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,000
You shrunk it.
You know you shrunk it.

242
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,900
Just tell me you shrunk it.

243
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,300
I shrunk it.

244
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,400
I think the only reason
we go to the dry cleaner...

245
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,300
...is so I can say to the dry cleaner:

246
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
"Well, it's ruined."

247
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Of course the dry cleaner
can respond:

248
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,700
"It's not our fault.

249
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,700
We're not responsible.
We just ruin the clothes.

250
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,500
That ends our legal obligation."

251
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
See, the whole problem
with dry-cleaning...

252
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,700
...is that we all believe
that this is actually possible.

253
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Right?
They're cleaning our clothes...

254
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,900
...but they're not getting anything wet.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,300
It's all dry.

256
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,800
I know there's gotta be some liquids
back there, some fluids they're using.

257
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,700
There's no such thing as dry-cleaning.

258
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,900
When you get something on your
shirt, ever try and get it off like that?

259
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,500
That's dry-cleaning.

260
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,700
I don't think that's what they're doing,
have 80 guys going:

261
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,000
"Come on. Hurry up.

262
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,500
There's a lot of shirts today."

263
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,900
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

264
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,000
What evidence is there that cats are
so smart anyway? What do they do?

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Because they're clean?

266
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm sorry. My uncle Pete
showers four times a day...

267
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,600
...and he can't count to 10,
so don't give me hygiene.

268
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
So, what are you gonna do?

269
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,400
I don't know.
I can't think of any solution.

270
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,000
Unless, of course, they should meet
with some unfortunate accident.

271
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you think a hit man would
charge to rub out a couple of cats?

272
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,800
Well, it couldn't be too expensive.

273
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,100
Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?

274
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,000
What do you think, Jerry,
you wanna make 28 bucks?

275
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
I'm no cat killer.

276
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,100
How about we go over there
right now...

277
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,400
...and we shave them?

278
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,000
I'd really like to go, Elaine.

279
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,200
But George is coming back
from the hospital, I gotta wait for him.

280
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,500
But otherwise, I would definitely go.

281
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,200
He actually went to the hospital?

282
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,600
- Yeah.
- Man, he's nuts.

283
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,700
Yeah, he's nuts.
You wanna bump off a couple of cats.

284
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,800
I know, I know. It's down again.

285
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,800
How much you down altogether?

286
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,700
I don't know, $1500.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,500
Wow.

288
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,400
You don't have to say "wow."
I know it's "wow."

289
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
And there's that smile again.

290
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
What is that?

291
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
It's George.

292
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,700
Yeah.

293
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop.
Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.

294
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
I really don't need to look.

295
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,100
What a body.

296
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,800
Yeah. That's for me.

297
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Yeah, and you're just what
she's looking for too.

298
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,700
Stranger leering through
a pair of binoculars 10 floors up.

299
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm gonna go down
and try and talk to her.

300
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,300
What?

301
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,300
What, did you go down there?

302
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,700
Did he tell you what's gonna happen?

303
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,500
How long were you there?

304
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,300
Fifteen seconds.

305
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,500
You told him you knew Simons.

306
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,800
Yeah, I mentioned Simons.

307
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,500
Next thing I know,
I'm in the parking lot!

308
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,500
Perhaps they had some sort
of a falling out.

309
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,200
I'll tell you one thing.

310
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know what he's got,
but for a sick guy, he's very strong.

311
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,500
Well, that's it.

312
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,300
Look, I'm going to Vermont.
I don't wanna think about this.

313
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm selling.

314
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,300
- Didn't work, huh?
- Not quite.

315
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Well, what are you gonna do
about the stock?

316
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm keeping it.

317
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,900
I'm going down with the ship.

318
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,200
So I know this guy, I'm getting
all my sneakers at a discount now.

319
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,700
I know. You mentioned it.

320
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
Oh, yeah. Right.

321
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,400
Oh, God, get me out of here.
What a mistak e.

322
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,600
What made me think
this would work?

323
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,500
And I've still got another day.

324
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,400
I've got nothing left to say.

325
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Wait, wait. I've got one.

326
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,700
That's a nice watch.

327
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,200
Yeah.

328
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,300
Do you wind it?

329
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,300
No. It's got a little battery.

330
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,100
Well, that's good.

331
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Well, the drive home
should be a delight.

332
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm speeding the whole way.
Let them throw me in jail, I don't care.

333
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,000
That's the manager, wanna see
if we can get another room?

334
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,300
No, it's okay.

335
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,100
So I guess you don't find the separate
faucets for the hot and the cold...

336
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,500
...charming?

337
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,900
Not especially.

338
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
Well, what do you wanna do
this afternoon?

339
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
What can we do? It's raining.

340
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,900
We could play Sorry.

341
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,300
We could play
Steal the Old Man's Bundle.

342
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,900
Maybe I can get an extension cord
and hang myself.

343
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,000
What kind of perfume is that
you're wearing?

344
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,400
Oh, you've never heard of it.

345
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,400
No. What kind is it?

346
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,700
I can't tell you.

347
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,800
Yeah, that's real normal.

348
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,600
Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look
at that business section?

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,500
- The stock?
- Thank you.

350
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,100
Thought you got out of that.

351
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,700
I did. I'm just curious.

352
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,400
It's been almost a week.
I wanna check it out.

353
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Six points?

354
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,900
It's up six points.

355
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,900
- I told you not to sell.
- You did not tell me not to sell.

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,900
I said the market fluctuates.
Remember?

357
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,600
Look, Vanessa...

358
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,400
...of course the market fluctuates.
Everybody knows that.

359
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,400
I just got fluctuated out of $4000.

360
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,800
That's probably why we're...

361
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,700
- What?
- Forget it.

362
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,300
No, that's probably why...

363
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,100
That's probably why
we're staying here...

364
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,600
...because you lost money
on the stock.

365
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,100
So, what am I looking at here?

366
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
Twenty-nine hours to go?

367
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,600
Well, at least I got plenty of time
to find out the name of that perfume.

368
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,700
James, he kills me.

369
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Have something else.
Have a little dessert.

370
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,100
- I'm good, thanks.
- Elaine, get something.

371
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,300
- It's all taken care of.
- I'm kind of full.

372
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,200
So don't finish it.

373
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,500
She's full.

374
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
So, big daddy...

375
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,800
...l'm just curious.
How much did you clear...

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,800
...on your little transaction there,
all told?

377
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,700
- I don't like to discuss figures.
- How much?

378
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I don't know, $8000. It's a Hyundai.
Get out of here.

379
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,100
I told you not to sell.

380
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,900
Simons made money,
Wilkenson cleaned up.

381
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
So Wilkenson's out of the hospital?

382
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,800
No. You'd be surprised.

383
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,900
You don't recover that quickly
from a nose job.

384
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,500
Is that still from those cats?

385
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
No.

386
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000
I just got a cold.

387
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,600
Whatever happened with that?

388
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
I gave him an ultimatum.

389
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
He chose the cats?

390
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,100
They're very clean animals.

391
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,900
I gotta say, that's pretty bad,
losing out to a cat.

392
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,000
Almost as bad as losing out
to a perfume.

393
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Told you those trips
are relationship-killers.

394
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,500
Too bad you can't get your buddy
Superman...

395
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,900
...to fly around the Earth
at super speed...

396
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,700
...and reverse time.

397
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,000
Get all the money back, could've
avoided the whole trip to Vermont.

398
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,100
Superman can go back in time?

399
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,000
We went over that.

400
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Wilkenson's got a bite on a new one.

401
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,400
The Tramco Corporation.

402
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,100
Out of...

403
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,400
...Springfield, I think.

404
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,900
They're about to introduce
some sort...

405
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,000
...of a robot butcher.

406
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,300
A robot butcher?

407
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,000
If you want to get in...

408
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,200
...very little time.

409
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,300
Sweetheart.

410
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,900
No, no. That ought to cover it.

411
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,100
Just a second. Just let me peek.

412
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,700
Good.

413
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Come on, come on...

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm not an investor.

415
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,400
People always say, "You should
have your money working for you."

416
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I've decided I'll do the work...

417
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,300
...l'm gonna let the money relax.

418
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,900
Know what I mean? Because
you send your money out there...

419
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,800
...working for you,
a lot of times it gets fired.

420
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,800
You go back, "What happened?
I had my money working for me."

421
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,600
"Yeah, I remember your money.

422
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,100
Showing up late, taking time off.

423
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,100
We had to let him go."
