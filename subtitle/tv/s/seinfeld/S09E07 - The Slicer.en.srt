1
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:08,774
HEY!
Morning!

2
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,424
Look, this is crazy, 
I can't go on like this.

3
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,013
Why?

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,115
I need some space.

5
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:20,007
Does that mean I have to go too?

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,999
You don't think she's just talking to me?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,615
Hey, shut up.

8
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:24,849
You shut up.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,309
I hate this.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,683
You'll get used to it. 
It's like a grubby scrub.

11
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:31,608
No, I don't want this anymore.

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,683
We'll come to work with you.
And on your dates.

13
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:38,092
And shopping.
And to the bathroom.

14
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:50,233
I can't breath...I'm sorry...
You're killing me!

15
00:00:50,234 --> 00:01:00,306
Turn your alarm off!

16
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:02,768
Your background is impressive George but

17
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,167
how does it apply to what we do here,

18
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,408
at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?

19
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,878
Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over,

20
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,769
you know, 
chiseling away, grinding down.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,731
In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.

22
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:20,754
It says here that you worked 
at Play Now for four days?

23
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:25,893
That should be 14, let me just.

24
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:30,489
George, I have to honest.
I could go either way with you...

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,187
But what the hell, 
we need someone, huh?

26
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:35,475
You won't regret this, sir.

27
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:38,631
I don't care.

28
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:48,374
Let's find you an office.

29
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,841
and then when I saw the photo
I remembered where I'd seen him:

30
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:53,904
the boom box incident.

31
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,353
the boom box incident?

32
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:59,557
Summer of '89 I'm at the beach.
This family sits up next to me.

33
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,790
I go into the surfs,
and when I come from out,

34
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,013
my clothes, my towel, my umbrella,
they're all gone.

35
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:06,403
I am furious.

36
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:08,943
I start screaming to these kids
demanding my stuff back

37
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:14,289
and finally I lose it I grab their boom box
and I chuck it in to the ocean.

38
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,968
Seems reasonable.

39
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,628
Then I see my clothes floating out there

40
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,929
The tied took them out, not the kids.

41
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,894
Even more reasonable.

42
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,365
So now, the father is screaming at me,

43
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,226
he's demanding that
I pay for the boom box

44
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:33,394
Finally, I gave them a fake address
and got the hell out of there.

45
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,258
And that guy is your new boss?

46
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,739
Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,679
Kruger? That's not 
Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,148
Yeah.

49
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:44,690
Grinders, sanders, whetstones.

50
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,380
They are the ones who botched 
the Statue of Liberty job.

51
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,730
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.

52
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:52,178
It is a horrible company.
There's no management what so ever.

53
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,429
I could go hog wild in there.

54
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,689
You now what you do?

55
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,144
You sneak that photo out of there
for couple of days and get it air brushed.

56
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,231
Like retouched.

57
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:03,282
You remember that photo of me
and Gerald Ford and I took it in.

58
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,300
Got that Ford right out of there.

59
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:13,818
Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless.
I can't wait to work for him.

60
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,717
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible.

61
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:25,812
Everywhere you go,
they give you this misshaped shardy meat.

62
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:29,378
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.

63
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:35,367
Neither have I.

64
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:39,547
Hey, our meat problems are solved.

65
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:42,710
Where did you get this thing?
I traded it to my sausage press.

66
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:46,340
Look how thin that is,
see that's all surface area.

67
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:50,304
The taste has nowhere to hide.

68
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:54,024
Hey, spice. Welcome to flavor country.

69
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,735
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.

70
00:03:57,736 --> 00:04:01,749
Sara Sitarides?

71
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,172
What's with you?

72
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:06,272
You remember that next
door neighbor of mine,

73
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:08,462
the apartment that always
smells like potatoes?

74
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,768
Your whole building smells like potatoes.

75
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,073
This jackass goes to
Paris, leaves the alarm on.

76
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:18,850
It's been beeping
since 3:30 this morning.

77
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:23,259
You know, that happened to Lomez,
so he blew his neighbor's circuit.

78
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,593
How do you do that?
Yeah well, that's easy.

79
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:28,821
Just let me finish this mile
high and I'll be right with you.

80
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:31,787
Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna
need a case of Kaiser rolls.

81
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:38,901
I think we might have one left 
in the stock room.

82
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:43,367
This hallway smells like potatoes.
I know, I know, this is it.

83
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:48,189
Ok, oh, you see this socket? 
It's probably connected to her apartment.

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,292
So what we'll do, we'll take
this paper clip and bend it

85
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,782
so it'll short out the entire circuit.

86
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:59,489
Here you go...

87
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,204
I think I'll let you do it.
- No no no. It's easy, just do it quickly.

88
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:07,351
No, I really don't want to.
Well, I don't want to either.

89
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:13,129
I thought you had done this before.
It's just...it's no picnic.

90
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:26,280
Well, how are we gonna do it?
Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.

91
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,166
Oh mama.
Are you okay?

92
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:32,306
I will lose that nail.

93
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,203
I enjoy the challenge of
medicine. Naturally you have

94
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,636
no idea what it's like to have
someone's life depending on you.

95
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,491
Well, I have this neighbor...

96
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:46,427
A joke. Do you have any idea
how it feels like to save someone's life?

97
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,492
Is it anything like hitting
a home run in softball?

98
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:55,306
No.
Cause I hit a whopper last week!

99
00:05:55,307 --> 00:06:00,212
Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.

100
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:05,773
What did you do here?
You took out the wrong guy.

101
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:09,014
I thought you said you wanted to be out?

102
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:13,144
Well, I'm still here. You
took out the other guy!

103
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:15,696
You've really lost a lot of hair.

104
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:21,120
I am aware!

105
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:24,732
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter.

106
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:35,665
76 bucks, how often do I make...oh
I've gotta buy a book.

107
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:40,007
The cat.

108
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,095
He took out Kruger?

109
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:45,731
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that
it's gone until this guy can fix it up.

110
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:47,215
This slicer is indomitable.

111
00:06:47,216 --> 00:06:49,210
Where did you get that butcher's coat?

112
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:51,781
You buy enough meat,
they'll give you anything.

113
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:55,193
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat.

114
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:58,624
When you blew the power,
we must've shut off the automatic feeder.

115
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,729
See, that's the same thing that happened
to Lomez.

116
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,995
What did he do about it?

117
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:08,675
Well, he moved to a hotel
and the cat eventually died.

118
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:12,636
Well, this meowing is
absolutely worst than the alarm.

119
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:14,508
Oh, that's a prickly one.

120
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,071
Yeah, how's the doctor date?
Eh, died on the table.

121
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,124
Just spent hour and
a half making me feel,

122
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,938
if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.

123
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:27,469
Well, she's very focused.
Dermatology is her life.

124
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,348
Dermatology?
- Yes, she's a dermatologist.

125
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:37,080
Saving lives? The whole profession is: 
"Eh, just put some aloe on it".

126
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:41,103
The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
- Where are we going?

127
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:45,577
The cat. Just grab that meat
and let's ride.

128
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:49,942
When are you going on your next date with her?
Oh, what's the point?

129
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:52,447
What, you're gonna pass
up a wonderful opportunity

130
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:54,313
to put that aloe pusher in her place?

131
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:57,584
Revenge date?
That sound like you more than me.

132
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,668
This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives?

133
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,362
She's one step away working
at the clinique counter!

134
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:08,853
Dermatologist? Skin
doesn't need a doctor!

135
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:12,181
Of course not! 
Wash it, dry it, move on!

136
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:15,938
You're right.
I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.

137
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,309
no no, this has to be
carefully orchestrated.

138
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,215
You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...

139
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:23,891
Flowers?
Yeah, you gotta do it classy

140
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:27,599
So, you've done this?
Almost.

141
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,678
Couldn't get the girl 
go out with me the second time.

142
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,408
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
Can it cut that thin?

143
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,699
Oh, I've cut slices so thin,
I couldn't even see them.

144
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:50,167
How did you know you cut it?
Well, I guess I just assumed.

145
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:55,664
Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
Yeah, that's a hall of famer.

146
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:58,113
Alright, let's do it. Alright, here we go.

147
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:01,175
Yeah, watch that baby slide...

148
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:07,725
Come on, come on kitty...
ooh...how about that; it worked!

149
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:11,697
Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
Oh no, I don't think so.

150
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,847
Why not?
Well, you're not checked at on it.

151
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:16,454
What do I have to know?
Well, where the meat goes?

152
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,428
Right there.
Where do you turn it on?

153
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:21,012
Right there.

154
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:25,578
But where does the meat go?

155
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:28,447
Restaurant, flowers...
this is so nice.

156
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:33,130
Well, I'm a classy guy. 
How's the life saving business?

157
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:39,032
It's fine.
- It must take a really really big zit to kill a man!

158
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:42,993
What is with you? 
You call yourself a lifesaver.

159
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:45,337
I call you pimple popper MD!

160
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:48,139
Dr. Sitarides?
Mr. Parry, how are you?

161
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,357
I just wanted to thank you again 
for saving my life.

162
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:58,890
She saved your life?
I had skin cancer.
Skin cancer! Damn.

163
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:05,020
You were right Kramer,
this slicer is absolutely amazing.

164
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:14,769
..yeah, yeah...no no no
I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.

165
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:22,044
These heals are so uneven.

166
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:27,972
Here you Mr. Costanza.

167
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:31,863
What is this? This is a drawing.

168
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,848
Looks real, doesn't it?

169
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,632
This is a cartoon!

170
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:40,810
Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory.
Considering, I think that's damn good.

171
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:44,628
But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!

172
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:50,723
Then you better get a camera.

173
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,488
He looks like a Peanuts character.
- I know.

174
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:57,034
The only way to fix it now,
is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.

175
00:10:57,035 --> 00:11:01,041
You can do that. Without his shirt on.
You can't do that.

176
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,817
Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.

177
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:06,992
It seemed so disorganized.
I understand.

178
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:12,786
What about the Coast Guard?
Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.

179
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:16,125
True. You mean, for you?

180
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:19,598
I think.
What about your sea sickness?

181
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:22,736
Maybe I could be a land guy.

182
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:25,230
I don't know if they have land guys.

183
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:30,134
Someone's have to unhook
the boat before it leaves... the place!

184
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:33,538
Pliers?
Drawer.
Got it.

185
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:36,019
What are they for?

186
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,309
I got a piece a my heel stuck in a slicer.
- Come again?

187
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:46,888
Okay, I got a little slicer-happy, but listen:
Don't tell Kramer. He has very strong feelings for it.

188
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,049
I forgot to ask you:
how did the revenge date go?

189
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,422
Eh, it went okay.

190
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,664
Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
Yeah, I started out real classy...

191
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,106
Yeah you did, you classed it up!

192
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,398
But then I found out about the skin cancer.

193
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,332
Oh, so it backfired?
Yeah.

194
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,691
So, I guess I was lucky that
I never tried that myself.

195
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,425
Of course she treats skin cancer.

196
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:11,101
That's how I met her, she
was doing a skin cancer

197
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,990
screening at Peterman.
That's what dermatologists do.

198
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:18,194
Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.

199
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:22,314
Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer
screening at Peterman?

200
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:24,636
Could she do that at Kruger?
I don't know, I guess.

201
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:27,812
So I set up a screening,
everyone takes their shirt off

202
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,907
and click, I snap me a shot
of a bear-chested Kruger.

203
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:35,334
You have a little thing for this fella'?

204
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:37,837
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.

205
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:41,272
Yesterday you said I had
to get my revenge on her!

206
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:43,022
And that was wrong,Jerry!

207
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,168
You simple must to apologize..

208
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:49,222
Must I?
Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.

209
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:52,348
How does that reflect me?

210
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:57,513
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000?
Cause I gotta slice.

211
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:01,141
Aah, I forgot it.
I gotta get home.

212
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:03,381
Ok, I'll go with you.

213
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,969
Umm, I'm not actually
going straight to home,

214
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,167
I have to first stop at the eh...circus,

215
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:14,437
you know with all the...clowns.

216
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:24,896
Oh, well you have fun... oh no clowns...
hate clowns...the clowns.

217
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:28,461
So again, I'm sorry. I had no
right to yell at you, you're

218
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:31,361
a life saving doctor and
I'm just a comedian...

219
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:34,121
Jerry, enough. I'll do your
friend's cancer screening,

220
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:37,934
because I believe in that, but as far
as you and I are concerned; it's off.

221
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:42,481
Was it pimple popper MD?
That's the one.

222
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:44,622
Still got it.

223
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:53,343
Out, damn heel!

224
00:13:53,344 --> 00:14:00,916
Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.
Just hold on!

225
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:07,140
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing...

226
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:12,688
Here, ok I'm on the phone alright?
I'm on the phone with someone...

227
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:17,175
My blade is all dinged up.
Oh, come on!

228
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:20,264
Phone call!
I'm in a big phone call!

229
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:23,475
Come on, this is important!

230
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:30,334
Hey, get the hell out of here!
Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.

231
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:34,505
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger
and they're smoothing it out for me.

232
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,291
What the hell is this?

233
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,937
Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction.

234
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,985
Have you been wearing a fake beard?

235
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:45,275
No.
Well, what have you been doing?

236
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,064
Nothing, I got up, run some errands,

237
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:49,449
I went down to Sara's
office and apologized...

238
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,697
Whoa whoa, backup,
Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?

239
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:54,627
Well, I tried to apologise,
it didn't go over that well...

240
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,968
There, there's your hives.

241
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:59,327
What, she gave me hives?
Jerry, as the Bible says:

242
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:03,345
Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.

243
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:06,282
She did kind of touch my face.
Now you listen to me,

244
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:08,046
you've got to find
this woman and tell her

245
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:09,727
that you're not a test tube pin cushion.

246
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:14,578
It does itch. Maybe I will go down
at Kruger and talk to her.

247
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:21,677
Alright, great, because
I got to get down there

248
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:31,140
and pick up my blade. Hey, and
I couldn't find that stock room.

249
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:36,098
Oh, that's fantastic.

250
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,718
I just talked to Mr. Kruger,
he'll be down in a minute.

251
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:41,056
He wanted me to take a
photograph for the record.

252
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:44,997
What record?
His personal file, I, I don't ask...

253
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:48,881
Jerry? What brings you here?
- I don't know, this?

254
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,873
Looks like hives.
- Where do you suppose that could've come from?

255
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,335
Jerry, what are you doing...
- He is just setting the record straight.

256
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:56,631
Come on Sitarides, cop to it.

257
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:58,864
What brand of perverted
science do you practice?

258
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:02,369
Are you suggesting I somehow
I infected you on purpose?

259
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,692
I want the antidote, pimple popper!

260
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:08,489
That's it, I'm out of here!
You're insane.

261
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,486
Am I? You touched my face.
I didn't imagine that!

262
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:17,358
Dr. Sitarides don't go!
Oh, thanks Jerry!

263
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:22,172
Hey George, hey Doc.
We doing the screening here?

264
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:25,649
Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in,

265
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,766
we'll be in in a second.
Be right with you.

266
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:30,516
Doc, huh?

267
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:33,076
Kramer, this is perfect.
I need you to go in there,

268
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,733
pretend you're a doctor and
check this guy for moles.

269
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:39,968
Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.

270
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,050
And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.

271
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,771
You really are cooking up 
a little scheme here, aren't you?

272
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:53,225
Alright, lets get in there.
Quick, quick, quick...

273
00:16:53,226 --> 00:17:07,567
This is it.
I can take this anymore.

274
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:14,667
Male mammal. Approximately
30 to 60 years of age.

275
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:18,501
Weight...uh indeterminate.

276
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:23,621
Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna 
take a photo now for the records.

277
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:27,177
So if you'll stand up please
and give me a big smile,

278
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:28,955
oh no no no, not that big.

279
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:33,528
Yeah, that's nice, yes okay.

280
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:41,396
Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh,
fiber from shirt on the left shoulder.

281
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:44,028
I'm gonna have to keep my on that.

282
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,639
How long have you been doing
this Dr. Van Nostrand?

283
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,817
Uuh, long long time.

284
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,888
Yes, I've seen moles so big
they have their own moles.

285
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:56,409
Freckles that cover two men.

286
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:07,970
So, how am I looking?
Oh, so far, so good...

287
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:11,810
Kramer, I really owe you one.
George, we got a problem.

288
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:16,116
What?
- He's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.

289
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:18,834
So, tell him you're concerned about it
and he should see someone else.

290
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:22,470
George, why would I, a
Juilliard trained dermatologist,

291
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,287
send him to another doctor?

292
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,476
Because, you're not a dermatologist.

293
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:29,514
He thinks I am. I'm not
gonna betray that trust.

294
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:32,080
Here's what I wanna do:
I think I can get a section...

295
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:32,642
Whoa, whoa, a section?!

296
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,008
Yeah, if I could crab my
slicer and he'd hold still...

297
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:38,725
No, you're not taking
a deli slicer to my boss...

298
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:44,169
It'll be ultra-thin, he'll barely feel it.
- No! Absolutely Not!

299
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:51,309
Well, it's my medical opinion,
that you're making a big mistake.

300
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,384
And it's going in my chart.

301
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:56,949
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?!

302
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,288
Oh, finally, listen I need someone
to come over here right away!

303
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:09,087
Turn it off! Turn it off!
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!

304
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,797
Alright, that's it!

305
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:18,539
Yeah, the address is 78th West...
Oh, oh mama...

306
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,321
So, Kramer pulled it off?

307
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:24,107
Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back
on his desk, no thanks to you.

308
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,904
Well, that woman had it coming to her.

309
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:28,503
Look at my neck, it looks
like I had a beard of bees!

310
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,139
Why don't you see someone about it?

311
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,005
I've called everyone. 
You know how hard it is

312
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,109
to get a dermatologist 
in this town?

313
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,681
A real dermatologist.

314
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,126
Squamous cell carcinoma.

315
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:41,916
You're not a doctor. You shouldn't
even have books like this.

316
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,494
George, that's what he has
and I have to give him a call.

317
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:45,605
Now we gotta came clean.

318
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:48,373
You can't tell him the truth,
you're gonna blow the whole thing.

319
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:49,905
I don't want this on my conscience.

320
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:53,647
I'll get him to see a real doctor.
You just stay away from this.

321
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:56,692
Hey, I wonder if they have
a picture of my rash in here.

322
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,943
They've got everything there, Jerry.
I underlined the best parts.

323
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:03,989
Hey, this looks like the thing I have.

324
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:10,621
Caused by exposure to benzene,
a common ingredient in metal cleaners.

325
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:15,192
Well, that's weird.
What are you doing?

326
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:18,710
Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
That's my hand towel!

327
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:20,926
I use that on my face, hands and chest!

328
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:23,650
That's where the hives
are coming from! ù It's

329
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:26,663
not from Dr. Sitarides,
it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!

330
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:32,166
So, somehow the Bronzo ? is reacting
to the poison she's giving you.

331
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:36,441
Alright, get out.
And take your Bronzo with you

332
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:42,634
Ohh, that's toxic.

333
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:47,189
George, come in. I'm just
going over our annual report...

334
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,486
boy did we take it
on the chin last year.

335
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:54,649
Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message 
from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says

336
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,166
it might be wise to you 
to see another doctor about that mole.

337
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,173
I'm not too worried about it.

338
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:04,022
Well, he said it could be cancer,
maybe you should get it checked out.

339
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:09,843
take a look at this photo.
This is taken 10 years ago.

340
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:14,288
That mole looks exactly
as it does today.

341
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:20,367
So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
Whatever.

342
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:26,594
Actually, funny thing about this photo
We were at the beach

343
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,436
and there was this dumb
looking guy near by.

344
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:32,118
When he went in for
a swim, my sons and I

345
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,054
took all his stuff and
threw it in the ocean!

346
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,417
What a pear shaped loser.

347
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:41,574
Well, that pear shaped loser was me!

348
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:44,303
And I was in that photo,
until I broke in here,

349
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,542
stole the photograph and
airbrushed myself out of there!

350
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:52,305
Well, I'll be...
you have lost a lot of hair.

351
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:59,940
That's what they tell me!

352
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:01,933
Do you want more pastrami?

353
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:05,367
Um, what was that last thing you gave me?
That was pretty good.

354
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:08,107
Yeah, it was olive loaf.
You want that?

355
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:11,014
I can't believe 
Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.

356
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:14,694
He said he didn't care. 
Oh, God I love that place.

357
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:18,746
Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian.

358
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:22,318
He said it was really bad.
What did he give you for it.

359
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,495
Aloe. So where's that lock smith?

360
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,597
Have to give him time on this hour.

361
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:30,535
Can I have a zip?
Oh yeah, coming up...
