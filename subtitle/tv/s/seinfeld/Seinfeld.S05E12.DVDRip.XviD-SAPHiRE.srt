1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,600
The whale's supposed to be
an intelligent animal.

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,503
You hear about how they communicate
by song from miles away...

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,871
...how extensive their vocabulary is.

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,513
From the rate we're pushing
the whales off the beach...

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,082
...back into the ocean,
the words ''shore'' and ''close''...

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,913
...do not appear to be
in their vocabulary.

7
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,521
l'd say to them,
''Concentrate less on the singing...

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,990
...a little more on the approaching
Cuervo beach volleyball tournament...

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,928
...if you want to maintain
that brainy-mammal image.''

10
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,837
<i>I can't believe this.</i>
<i>What a dope!</i>

11
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,797
Excuse me. l'm sorry.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,941
This is<i>....</i>
This is kind of embarrassing...

13
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,604
...but there's no toilet paper
over here.

14
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,814
Are you talking to me?

15
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:56,149
Yeah. l just forgot to check,
so if you could spare some<i>....</i>

16
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,222
No, l'm sorry.

17
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,386
-What?
-No, l'm sorry. l can't spare it.

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,553
-You can't spare it?
-No. There's not enough to spare.

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,698
Well, l don't need much.
Just three squares will do it.

20
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,064
l'm sorry, l don't have three squares.
Now, if you don't mind<i>....</i>

21
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,434
Three squares?
You can't spare three squares?

22
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,440
No, l don't have a square to spare.
l can't spare a square!

23
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:22,174
Well, is it two-ply? Because
if it's two-ply, l'll take one ply.

24
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:27,079
One ply. One puny little ply.
l'll take one measly ply!

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,245
Look, l don't have a square
and l don't have a ply!

26
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,891
No, no, don't go! l beg you!

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,291
l love this artificial flavoring.

28
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,498
l like it better than butter.
l think it's more consistent.

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,468
You would not believe what just
happened to me in the bathroom.

30
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,163
-Hey.
-Hey.

31
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,635
-Hey, where's my popcorn, babe?
-What?

32
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,938
My popcorn. You were supposed
to get me popcorn.

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,479
Did you forget about me, babe?

34
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,448
You would not believe what just
happened to me in the bathroom.

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,578
l mean, a person needs a certain
amount of toilet paper to be covered.

36
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,747
l simply could not spare it.

37
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,689
This woman just didn't get it.
She kept harassing me.

38
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,524
Three squares!
That's all l was asking for.

39
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,222
Three squares!

40
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,698
She wouldn't stop.
''Help me! Help me!''

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,997
She was insane.

42
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,037
l was begging her.

43
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,107
''Please, please!''

44
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,107
She was insane.

45
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,139
Who does she think she is?
How dare she?

46
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,839
Do you want me to get
the manager?

47
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,009
Too bad they don't have old ladies
walking around with flashlights.

48
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,486
-Flush her out.
-l don't even know what she looks like.

49
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,751
l wonder where Elaine is sitting.
l really wanted you to meet her.

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,155
She's supposed to be here
with her new boyfriend.

51
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,490
l wonder where Jerry's sitting.

52
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,859
He's supposed to be here
with his new girlfriend.

53
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,696
-l'm dying to see what she looks like.
-Hey.

54
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,665
You think if l jumped off
that balcony, l'd get hurt?

55
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,808
-Hey. Hey, guy.
-Hey.

56
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,442
Can l use your phone
in your bedroom?

57
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,608
What's the matter with yours?

58
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,513
My batteries are dead.

59
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,179
lt's not one of those 9 76 calls, is it?

60
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,583
Come on. Let me use it.
Five minutes. l'll pay you back.

61
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,922
Why do you do that?

62
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,361
l am never going
to the movies again.

63
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,526
Where were you last night?
l looked for you.

64
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,865
l looked for you too.
l was over on the side.

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,941
Oh, with pretty boy Tony.

66
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,373
-Yeah, right. Okay.
-''Hey. Hey.'' Tony.

67
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,548
-''Hey.''
-That's nice. Listen to this.

68
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,741
l am in the bathroom, right,
before the movie starts...

69
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,580
...and l'm in the stall,
and there's no toilet paper.

70
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,619
No what?

71
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,619
Toilet paper.

72
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,027
So...

73
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,192
...l ask this woman in the stall
next to me for some...

74
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,699
...and she refuses!

75
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,394
Well, maybe she couldn't spare it.

76
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,239
-A square?
-Well, you know...

77
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,777
...sometimes a square is everything.

78
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,643
-A ply?
-Elaine, you cannot judge a person...

79
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,913
...in a situation like that. lt's like asking
for someone's canteen in the desert.

80
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,648
-lt's battle conditions.
-Yeah, well...

81
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,459
...l just hope l run
into her again, okay?

82
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:25,394
Because l will never forget that
flinty voice. lt is tattooed in my brain.

83
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,632
lf l hear it, watch out.

84
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,770
So listen, what happened
with Jane last night?

85
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,099
Jane, she<i>....</i> She<i>....</i>

86
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,835
The four of us are going out
Saturday. That should be fun.

87
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,378
Yeah, that should be real fun.

88
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,846
-lt's getting late. Can l call Tony?
-Yeah.

89
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,482
<i>Then we'll get a cab</i>
<i>and we'll do it in the back seat.</i>

90
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,653
<i>How's that, Andre?</i>

91
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,220
-Andre?
-<i>What about the driver?</i>

92
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,488
-<i>We'd get in an accident.</i>
-<i>So what?</i>

93
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,260
<i>Well, that wouldn't be very good.</i>

94
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,997
Hey, Andre, get the hell off
the phone!

95
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,870
-What is going on? Who is Andre?
-Kramer's Andre.

96
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,911
He's fooling around
with these 9 76 numbers.

97
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:19,245
Hey, l told you, l don't want you
doing that on my phone!

98
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,149
Jerry, l'm telling you,
this phone-sex thing is hilarious.

99
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,846
Like this Erica woman. Here, look.

100
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,888
You gotta call her.
What a voice she uses.

101
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,495
You know, it's weird, because
that voice sounded familiar to me.

102
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,130
-You hungry? Wanna--? Monk's?
-No. l gotta go downtown.

103
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,062
-You're giving me a lift home, right?
-Yeah.

104
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,260
So listen, what happened
last night with Jane?

105
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,374
Oh, nothing.
She just choked on a Jujube.

106
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,835
You know, l hate to tell you this,
but it is time to defrost your freezer.

107
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,505
l know.
l just can't bring myself to do it.

108
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,880
Meanwhile that freezer keeps
getting smaller and smaller.

109
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,749
Don't wanna keep Tony waiting.

110
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,486
-Hey, you got a problem with Tony?
-Hunky Tony. ''Hey.''

111
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,692
Okay. Jerry, l would be going out with
him no matter what he looked like.

112
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,529
-Of course you would.
-Oh, yeah. Like you're one to talk.

113
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,897
-Elaine...
-What?

114
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:16,132
...it's different for a man.
We're expected to be superficial.

115
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,779
-l'm not being superficial.
-Elaine, he's a male bimbo.

116
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,245
He's a ''mimbo.''

117
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,542
He's not a mimbo.

118
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,913
He is an exciting, charismatic man...

119
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,783
...who just happens to have
a perfect face.

120
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,788
And that's why
you're going out with him.

121
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,256
No, it is not.

122
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,918
You know, l think George
has a non-sexual crush on him.

123
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,620
l think he does too.

124
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:42,427
l mean, every time l see him,
it's Tony this, Tony that.

125
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,832
George is like a schoolgirl
around him.

126
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,701
So l said:

127
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,339
''Hey, dude...

128
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,736
...you better step off.''

129
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,871
-Step off?
-Yeah.

130
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,810
You said, ''Step off''?

131
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,747
God, that is too much!

132
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,082
Hey, hey, Tony...

133
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,925
...l just had this brainstorm for us.

134
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,429
-Can you guess what it is?
-No.

135
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,358
Bowling.

136
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,798
What do you say? Bowling, huh?

137
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,768
Bowling's insane!
Bowling is crazy time!

138
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,373
Bowling?

139
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,534
l don't think so, George.
You get no rush from bowling.

140
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,237
Rush? You want a rush?

141
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,441
Drop a ball on your toe, my friend!

142
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,143
Talk about a rush,
you'll be throbbing!

143
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,687
-You'll see visions!
-No, no, no.

144
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,381
l'm thinking...

145
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,787
...rock climbing.

146
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,554
All right! Rock climbing!

147
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:49,224
Just the two of us? All right. All right.
Hey, l'll make some sandwiches.

148
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,461
What do you like?
Tuna, peanut butter?

149
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,902
-Whatever.
-All right. l gotta buy some bread.

150
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,508
You know, l am definitely down
for some rock climbing.

151
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,908
Yeah, me too. l am down.
l am totally down.

152
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,707
Mark me down.

153
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,978
Cool. So, what do you say
we climb a rock mañana?

154
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,288
Mañana.

155
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,887
Mañana might be a problem.
l'm supposed to...

156
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,461
...have a boil lanced mañana...

157
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,664
...and l think they charge me if l cancel
with only one mañana's notice.

158
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,359
-Hey, Kramer!
-Hey, Tony.

159
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,731
-Hey!
-Hey, Georgie.

160
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,533
Kramer, my man,
what are you doing mañana?

161
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,006
Mañana l'm doing <i>nada.</i>

162
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,543
What do you say you scale some rock
with me and George?

163
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,544
Tony, that's gonna be
too many sandwiches.

164
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,182
Come on, Kramer.
What do you say?

165
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,851
Kramer, it's pretty dangerous
up there.

166
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,418
-No, l'm down.
-Yes!

167
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,954
-Yeah! l'll see you.
-All right, buddy. Take it easy, Kramer.

168
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,591
You down, George? What's wrong?

169
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,557
-Oh, no, l am down.
-Yeah!

170
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,990
Rock climbing?

171
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,933
Where do you come off
going rock climbing?

172
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,197
Rock climbing?

173
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,038
You need a boost
to climb into your bed.

174
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,404
All right. All right.

175
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,576
What is it with you and Tony?
What, you're his sidekick now?

176
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,473
Yeah. That's right. l like it.

177
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,551
He's such a cool guy.

178
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,047
''A cool guy''?
What, are you in eighth grade?

179
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,822
He's the first cool guy
l've ever been friends with in my life.

180
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,427
lt's a different world
when you're with a cool guy.

181
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,063
He's not afraid of anybody.

182
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,290
You should hear the way
he talks to waitresses.

183
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,263
He gets free pie!

184
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,964
-Hey.
-Hey.

185
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,072
-Nice move today.
-What?

186
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,071
Horning in on my rock-climbing trip!

187
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,834
lt's just supposed to be
me and Tony.

188
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,444
-He asked me.
-You put him on the spot.

189
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,343
You know, l think that
you're in love with him.

190
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,387
What?

191
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,357
-That's ridiculous!
-No, no. l don't think so.

192
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,422
You love him.

193
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,202
You better be careful on
those rocks tomorrow, buddy.

194
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,998
And you're not getting
any sandwiches either!

195
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,772
-You're making sandwiches?
-Hello?

196
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,504
l don't know if there's gonna be
places to eat up there.

197
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,205
-Who?
-Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?

198
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,975
Hates it.

199
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,142
Good thing l asked.

200
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,651
Who is it?

201
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,790
-Well, she says Jane.
-Yeah, so?

202
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,121
Well, that voice, it's very familiar.
Throaty, almost flinty.

203
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,025
-Did you say ''flinty''?
-Yeah. Yeah. Flinty.

204
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,839
Hello!

205
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,373
Hello!

206
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,340
Hey, George, you hear that echo?

207
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,474
Oh, God, please get off me!
l don't want to die up here!

208
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,050
Please! Please, please stop moving.
That's all l ask of you.

209
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,383
-Kramer! Kramer!
-Let go! Hey!

210
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,189
George, let go of my leg!
Grab the rock!

211
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,088
-Grab the rock!
-What rock?

212
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,320
The rock in front of you!

213
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,289
Come on, grab it!

214
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,558
You've gotta relax.
Try to yodel. Yodel.

215
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,932
-That's it. That's it.
-George! Kramer!

216
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,907
-Yeah?
-Take the rope...

217
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,138
...thread it through the carabiner
and knot it.

218
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,906
Then l'll climb up to where you are.

219
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,415
-All right. George, you got it?
-Yeah.

220
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,553
-You got it, George?
-Yeah.

221
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,949
All right, take it.

222
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,522
Hey, George,
you got anything to eat, dude?

223
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,216
Yeah, l<i>....</i>

224
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,558
l got some sandwiches.

225
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,988
l got tuna and salmon salad, Tony...

226
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,796
...because l know
you don't like peanut butter.

227
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,198
What?

228
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,275
Do some--

229
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,920
l've got oil all over me.
Can l have your napkin?

230
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,585
-What?
-Your napkin. l'm dripping.

231
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,788
-Well, where's your napkin?
-l used it up.

232
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,557
Well, l need mine.

233
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,895
Oh, God, look at the time.
l gotta get to work.

234
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,501
You know, l'd like to hear
about this job of yours.

235
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,140
l told you already, it's very boring.

236
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,436
You know, l think l had
a little too much garlic.

237
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,136
-Can l have a piece of your gum?
-You're fine.

238
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,410
-Oh, how's this thing work?
-Just press it.

239
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,609
-<i>It's Elaine.</i>
-Oh, come on up.

240
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,585
-Who is it?
-lt's Elaine.

241
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,853
-ls she coming up?
-Yeah.

242
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,458
Your breath is a little garlicky.
You better take some gum.

243
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,099
-Okay.
-Here, have a couple pieces.

244
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,703
lt's weak. Weak gum. Yeah.

245
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,636
-Have some more. For the road.
-lsn't that too much?

246
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,436
Trust me. Believe me.

247
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,170
-lt's good. Yes.
-Smells?

248
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,372
Yeah. Stinks. Terrible.

249
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,977
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hi.

250
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,813
How are you? This is Jane. Elaine.

251
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,248
-Hi.
-Hi.

252
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,491
Nice to meet you finally.

253
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,356
lt is so nice to meet you.

254
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,689
l look forward to Saturday night.

255
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,557
Yeah, me too.

256
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,028
-Okay, so l'll see you Saturday night.
-Saturday night.

257
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,536
What is with the gum?

258
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:37,148
lt's a big problem. She puts like four
pieces in her mouth. lt's ridiculous.

259
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,216
l don't think we can
get together Saturday.

260
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,843
-Because of the gum?
-Well, it's too much. lt's embarrassing.

261
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,381
-Why does she chew so many?
-She always has to be different.

262
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,996
-She's in there. l can hear her.
-All right, who's gonna tell her?

263
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,958
-You tell her.
-lt was your fault.

264
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,157
lf you hadn't come,
it wouldn't have happened!

265
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,695
l was the one who was invited,
you--

266
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,430
-Well, look. Look who's here.
-Hey!

267
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,904
-What are you doing here?
-You're alive!

268
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,770
Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,474
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

270
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,545
-Well<i>....</i> Yes.
-For a little while.

271
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,982
Where's Tony?

272
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,822
Kramer was supposed to tie a knot--

273
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,053
-You were supposed to tie the knot.
-What, did something happen?

274
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,725
Well...

275
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,961
...Tony took a bit of a tumble.

276
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,767
His face? Did something
happened to his face?

277
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,907
Well, it all depends on what
you mean by ''happen.''

278
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,408
-He's alive.
-Yeah.

279
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,774
What happened to his face?
Tell me, what happened?

280
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:48,079
Well, you see, he slipped
and landed on a kind of a<i>....</i>

281
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,812
-A rock.
-Yeah.

282
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,447
-The ambulance got there quickly.
-A big rock.

283
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,092
We rode with him to the hospital.

284
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,820
Yeah. l sang ''99 Bottles
of Beer on the Wall.''

285
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,057
Well, aside from that,
how'd he like the sandwiches?

286
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,966
So, what did the doctor say?

287
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,940
They said<i>....</i>

288
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,638
-They said l'm coming along.
-Yeah.

289
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,616
But what else did they say?

290
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,278
Well, let's see. They said:

291
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,787
''Tony, try to keep it clean.''

292
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,152
Right. Yeah. No, l mean...

293
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,818
...did they get into stuff like...

294
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,931
...long, jagged scars...

295
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,694
...or gross deformities,
major skin grafts, stuff like that?

296
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,872
l really don't remember.
l was kind of out of it...

297
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,271
...the first couple of days.
l was on a lot of medication.

298
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,774
lt was kind of like a haze.
lt was pretty cool.

299
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,183
But, you know, in this
medicated haze...

300
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,980
...in this sort of woozy state...

301
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,385
...do you recall the words...

302
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,492
...''radical reconstructive surgery''
being uttered?

303
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,728
l don't know. l don't know.

304
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,655
-Think, Tony. Think.
-l'm drawing a blank, babe.

305
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,493
Excuse me.

306
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,841
-Hi, Elaine.
-Yeah, this--

307
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,140
-This isn't a very good time, George.
-l just wanted...

308
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,873
...to talk to Tony for a minute.

309
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,383
Step off, George.
l don't want to see you.

310
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,045
-Me? Step off?
-Yeah.

311
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,850
Tony says you better step off,
George, so<i>....</i>

312
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,689
But why? lt wasn't my fault. l--
You asked me for a sandwich. l--

313
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,423
l made such delicious
sandwiches, Elaine.

314
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,733
Just beat it, dude!

315
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,199
Here, Elaine, here. lt's <i>Superman.</i>

316
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,637
Tony, please. Next time,
it'll just be the two of us.

317
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,042
There won't be any next time,
George.

318
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,514
-Oh, Tony, don't.
-Okay.

319
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,780
Step off, George, okay?
Can you just step off? Step off.

320
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,683
Step off. Step off.

321
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,791
-George, wait, wait.
-Yes?

322
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,122
Would you throw this trash out?

323
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,402
Oh, l've been waiting a while for this.

324
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,438
lt's a shame Tony
got all banged up.

325
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,580
We're not gonna be able
to get together.

326
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,511
-Oh, that's too bad. What a shame.
-Yeah, it is.

327
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,584
lt's a damn shame.
A damn shame.

328
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,454
-Maybe when he's feeling better.
-Yeah. Without a doubt. l'm down.

329
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,487
-Oh, hey. How you doing?
-Hey, hey.

330
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,026
-Jane, this is my neighbor, Kramer.
-Oh, hey.

331
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,959
Hello, Kramer.

332
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,734
Well, hello, Jane.

333
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,434
Jerry's told me so much about you,
l feel like l know you intimately.

334
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,407
l don't think so.
No, we never met.

335
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,548
-l never talked to you on the phone.
-Where you going?

336
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,343
-Uptown. To the Y.
-l'm going uptown. Wanna split a cab?

337
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,183
What about the driver?

338
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,925
What are you talking about?

339
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,688
l changed my mind.
Yeah, l don't think l'm gonna go now.

340
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,861
All right, l'll see you later.
Nice meeting you.

341
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,523
See you.

342
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,004
-What's with you?
-That's her.

343
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,764
-Who?
-Erica! She's Erica!

344
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,799
Oh, you think she's Erica,
the phone-sex woman?

345
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,105
Jerry, that voice
is tattooed on my brain, it's her.

346
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,646
-l'm telling you, it's her!
-Oh, you're crazy.

347
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:42,810
Am l? Or am l so sane
that you just blew your mind?

348
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,519
-lt's impossible!
-ls it?

349
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,958
Or is it so possible that your head
is spinning like a top?

350
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,388
-lt can't be!
-Can't it?

351
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:57,160
Or is your entire world
just crashing down all around you?

352
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,169
-All right. That's enough.
-Yeah!

353
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,842
He's supposed to get
the bandages off on Sunday.

354
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,746
-What if?
-What?

355
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,839
You know:

356
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,411
You're afraid he might look
like Zippy the Pinhead.

357
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,647
Yeah. l mean,
what is my obligation here?

358
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,190
You know, we were just dating.

359
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,727
lt was probably gonna be over
in a couple of weeks anyway.

360
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,156
l thought you didn't care
about his looks.

361
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,924
l lied.

362
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,835
Are you kidding?
He's a mimbo. l know that.

363
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,905
But he's my mimbo.
And even if he is a hideous freak...

364
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,512
...maybe l can learn to love him.

365
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,908
And maybe in some final irony...

366
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,350
...l'll learn what love really is.

367
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,721
You know, Jerry?

368
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,390
l'm sorry. l didn't get most of that.

369
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,528
-ls that Kramer over there?
-Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,531
Hey, Kramer.

371
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,499
-Hey.
-Hey.

372
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,467
-lt's all set.
-What's all set?

373
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,905
Erica's gonna meet me here.
Now we're gonna find out the truth.

374
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:15,205
-How'd you get her to meet you here?
-We have a certain chemistry.

375
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,106
Oh, my God!

376
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,376
Hi. l thought l'd find you here.

377
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,519
-Hello, Erica.
-Erica? What are you talking about?

378
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,158
How could you say things
like that over the phone?

379
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,056
What are you talking about?

380
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,424
Selling sexual pleasure
on the phone?

381
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,123
l sell paper goods, you jerk.

382
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,961
Paper goods?

383
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,968
Excuse me.
Do you have a tissue?

384
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,141
No, l'm sorry. l can't spare it.
There's just not enough to spare.

385
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,075
Where's the ladies' room?

386
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,813
l have to go to the bathroom too.

387
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,059
Oh, damn.

388
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,431
Something wrong?

389
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,265
Yeah, there's no toilet paper in here.
l usually check. Would you mind?

390
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,576
l can't. l don't have it.
l don't have a square to spare.

391
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,639
l can't spare a square.

392
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,647
Hey, wait a minute.

393
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,181
-l know you!
-That's right, honey.

394
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,842
-And l know you!
-No. Wait!

395
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,715
No!

396
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,624
-Here. Take it.
-Thanks.

397
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,230
Don't call me anymore.

398
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,740
You either.

399
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,556
Now, of course, the thing is
extreme sports. Bungee jumping.

400
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,216
To me, the bungee jumping is a sport,
so is being a crash-test dummy.

401
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,022
Just leaning does not
make it a sport.

402
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,995
lt's like a Wile E. Coyote idea,
isn't it?

403
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,964
The thing l wonder about
the skydiving...

404
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,194
...is why do they even
bother with the helmets?

405
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,801
Can you almost make it?

406
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,112
You might as well wear a party hat.
What's the difference?

407
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,647
You jump out of a plane
20,000 feet in the air...

408
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,808
...the chute doesn't open,
l got news for you:

409
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,783
The helmet is now wearing you
for protection.

410
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,456
Later on, the helmet is talking
to the other helmets:

411
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,751
''Good thing he was there, or
l would have hit the ground directly.''
