1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,600
Careful, this plate is extremely hot.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,300
Thank you.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,400
I just told you it was hot. 
Why'd you touch it?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
I just wanted to know 
what your idea of "hot" is.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,500
Hey, babe. 
You ready to hit the ice?

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
I am ready to skate up a--

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,200
Why are you wearing that?

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,300
It's my winter coat.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,100
A fur?

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,900
Is there a problem?

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,900
A seemingly infinite supply.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,900
Careful, it's hot.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,900
So, Puddy wear's a man fur?

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,900
He was strutting around the coffee shop 
like Stein Erickson.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,400
And, of course, you find fur 
morally reprehensible.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Eh, anti-fur. 
I mean, who has the energy anymore? 

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,700
This is more about 
hanging off the arm of an idiot.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
And this is the first 
you're seeing of the coat?

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,300
We never dated in winter.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,300
You might want to get a look 
at that bathing suit drawer.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,300
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's 
the other day, 

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,800
and I saw that massage chair 
we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,900
An apartment-warming gift? 

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,700
We got to give presents to people for moving? 

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. 
I would like one month off.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. 
That's what we're getting him.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
All right, but we're not buying it at Bloomingdale's. 

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
I will buy it, you pay me back later. 

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,500
I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,800
Cheapness is not a sense.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,500
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. 

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
You know, the second you walk in, 
he's got you working for him. 

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,200
"Hey, can you do me a favor? 

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,200
"Can you keep an eye on the ice, 
make sure we have enough?"

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,600
I had a great time at the last one. 
I was in charge of the music. 

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,900
I turned that mother up.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,400
Hey.
- Hey.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,800
You got any pliers?

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
What, has Newman got 
another army man stuck in his ear?

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Hilarious.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door,
so you can see in.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,300
Why?

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,900
To prevent an ambush.

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,900
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone 
is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,700
But then anyone can just look in and see you.

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,500
Our policy is, 
we're comfortable with our bodies. 

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
You know, if someone wants to 
help themselves to an eyeful, 

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
well, we say, "Enjoy the show!"

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... 
second act.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,200
Hey, George. Here's the model number 
on that chair, by the way.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,900
Nice wallet.

52
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,600
Wallet.

53
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,400
What?

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,300
Nobody carries wallets anymore. 

55
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,000
I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. 

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
See, here's what you need. 
Just a couple of cards and your bankroll.

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,900
See, keep the big bills on the outside.

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,900
That's a five.

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Eh, what are you doing?

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,500
Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.

62
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. 

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm the super. Who said you could do that?

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,300
Well, who says I can do 
any of the things I do in my place?

65
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,500
Like what?

66
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Well, like... 

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Uh, nothing. 

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,900
No, I'll--
switch it back.

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,300
No, no, no, no. 
No, that's all right.

70
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,700
Well, that's good. 
Because, uh, Newman and I, we think that--

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,600
Newman? He did this, too?

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,100
Well, yeah.

73
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,100
I deal with him.

74
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,600
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair
we're getting for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Except the store's in Delaware.

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,900
I'll have 'em overnight it.

77
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,500
Maybe cheapness is a sense. 

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,900
You know it is better without this big wallet. 
It's more comfortable.

79
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,700
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. 
It's wrong.

80
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Why?

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,300
Because important things go in a case. 

82
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,300
You got a skull for your brain, 
a plastic sleeve for your comb, 

83
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,300
and a wallet for your money.

84
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,800
But look at this thing. 

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
It's-it's huge. 
You got more cow here than here.

86
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,500
I need everything in there.

87
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Irish money?

88
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
I might go there.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
"Show this card at any participating 
Orlando-area Exxon station

90
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,800
"to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster."

91
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,400
All right, just gimme that. 

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,400
And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,500
Who is it?

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
It's Newman.

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
What do you want? 
I'm in the middle of something.

96
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
I can't believe I'm being evicted.

97
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,100
What? What are you talking about?

98
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,200
The reverse peepholes. 

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,500
Silvio said I'm an agitator 
and I'm out of the building.

100
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,700
No. No, he can't do that.

101
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm homeless! 

102
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm gonna be out on a street corner, 
dancing for nickels. 

103
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,900
I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, 
eating out of a bucket.

104
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Come on, we'll go and talk to him,
and we'll straighten this thing out.

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
You, uh, better put something on.

106
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
A man carries a wallet.

108
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
You know, the very fact that you oppose this
makes me think I'm onto something.

109
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Hey, Jerry.

110
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,800
Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
- Thanks. 

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone 
in case anybody calls and needs directions?

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,900
Love to.
- Thanks. 

113
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,600
Jerry...

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,300
Music?

115
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium 
and make sure nobody taps on the glass?

116
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,500
But I could do that and the music.

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Oh, no, don't worry about the music. 
Just... have fun!

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,700
I was ready to get jiggy with it.

119
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,900
Hey.
- Hey, Elaine.

120
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey. 

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,300
I think you know Dr... Zaius.

122
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,300
So, Elaine, notice anything different 
about my... pants?

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So, George... 

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,100
did you get the chair?

125
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,400
No, I don't have it yet.

126
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
So, we're giving him nothing?

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,100
No, I brought a picture of the chair.

128
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,200
Did you at least get him a card?

129
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
I thought we'd all sign the picture.

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Elaine...

131
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Hey, Joe Mayo.

132
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,300
I need you to be in charge of coats.

133
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Oh, fantastic.

134
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,500
And Puddy, can you make sure 
no one puts a drink on my sound system?

135
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,900
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.

136
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,800
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?

137
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
Nice.

138
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,700
It's working. 

139
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,600
Don't tap on the glass.

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,300
Joe Mayo's apartment?

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,800
Hey! 

142
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Cocktail off the speaker.

143
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.

144
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,400
Why are we in Jerry's apartment?

145
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, I like to think of this 
as my conference room. 

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It has a more formal atmosphere, you know, 
with the shelves, and the furniture.

147
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,300
Make it quick, Kramer. 
My wife and I are about to go bowling.

148
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Well, um-- Newman thinks that 
you, uh, evicted him?

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,300
I did. 

150
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't like Mr. Newman. 

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
He is an agitator.

152
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,300
Look. I've known Newman all my life, 
in the building, and you're all wrong about him. 

153
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,100
He's a model tenant. 

154
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.

155
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,100
OK, on your word he can stay.

156
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,000
All right.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

158
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, you won't regret it.

159
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
What's wrong?

160
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
Elaine, thanks for coming.

161
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,100
Good working with you.

162
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,900
All right, let's hit the bricks.

163
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,700
What?

164
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,700
Hey, I got a coat just like this!

165
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,100
Oh. Uhhh...

166
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,200
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.

167
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
And you threw it out the window?

168
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,700
Mm-hmm.

169
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,800
God, you're like a rock star.

170
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,000
So now Joe Mayo 
wants me to buy him a new coat.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
Because you threw it out.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,000
No, because I was in charge of the coats. 

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's insane.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,300
But you did actually throw his coat 
out the window.

175
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
But he doesn't know that. 

176
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,100
As far as he knows, someone stole it, 
and that's the person who should be held responsible.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,300
But that's you.

178
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,900
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, 

179
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,900
even though I don't think I should be 
held responsible, which I am anyway.

180
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,500
Well, I'm satisfied. 

181
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Uh. My back is killing me.

182
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,800
Of course. Because of that wallet. 

183
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
You got a filing cabinet 
under half of your ass.

184
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,300
This is an organizer, 
a secretary, and a friend.

185
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,400
Look at you. You're on a slant.

186
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.

187
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,300
There, there I'm fine.

188
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,100
What was that?

189
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
I think I had some hard candy in there.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,600
No, no, this is supposed to go 
to Joe Mayo's apartment.

191
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,600
How does this thing work?

192
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Sir, do you want me to deliver this 
to your friend's place or not?

193
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,300
Ready to go?

194
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,100
All set. I can't believe we're going dancing.

195
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,800
You don't go that often?

196
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,100
No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?

197
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,900
Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?

198
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Compact, lipstick, all this?

199
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,300
And can you also carry my keys?

200
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,800
What are you, a medieval dungeon master?

201
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,800
And a tin of altoids.

202
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
Sharp key.

203
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,700
So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?

204
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, there's very little sleeping going on.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?

206
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,800
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,500
Well, it's my business now.

208
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,600
Look, I stuck up for you. 

209
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,300
Man, if he catches you, we're both out.

210
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,900
Hey, what is that up that tree?

211
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,300
Man, that looks like a dead bear.

212
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,300
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, give me a boost.

213
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Where did you learn to climb trees like that?

214
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,100
The Pacific Northwest.

215
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,700
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.

216
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,500
You don't understand. 

217
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I went on a successful pocket diet, 
and I want to keep that weight off.

218
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,600
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman 
that would be perfect for you.

219
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,800
No. No. 
It's a small men's carryall.

221
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,900
I'm not carrying a purse.

222
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,100
It's not a purse. It's European.

223
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh.

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,500
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?

225
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I don't know.

226
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
If I'm getting him a new fur, 
I'm not chipping in on a gift, too.

227
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Yeah?

228
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,500
Hey, George, 
did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?

229
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...

230
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,100
What?

231
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,100
It's in... transit.

232
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,500
Did he get it?
- No.

233
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,400
Good. Tell him I'm out.

234
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,900
What, she's out?

235
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
Well, so what? 
You're getting a deal, right? 

236
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,800
We'll split it three ways.

237
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Allllll right!

238
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,100
What is that noise?

239
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
That's my toaster. I got to go.

240
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,100
You know, sometimes I get the feeling 
George isn't being completely honest with me.

241
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,100
Hey. 

242
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,900
Oh, uh, yeah. 

243
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Here are your pliers back.
- Thanks.

244
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Weak hinge.

245
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.

246
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.

247
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,000
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
Well, they're hanging from the trees. 

249
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,500
You know, Newman found one there yesterday. 

250
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!

251
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,600
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. 

252
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,300
That's the coat!

253
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,700
What was that pop sound?

254
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Well, I had some hard candy in there.

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,300
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?

256
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,500
Come in, come in.

257
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. 

258
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,000
Aside from this rattan piece, 
which seems oddly out of place.

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,200
Please, sit down. 

260
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Newman, um, 
I wanted to talk to you about something.

261
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,700
This isn't about my opening your mail?
- What?

262
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,400
Because I don't, never have, 
anything I read was already open.

263
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,700
Uh... no. 

264
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Newman, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. 

265
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,800
And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, 
and I'd like to give it back to him.

266
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Sorry. Climbers, keepers.

267
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,200
You know, Newmie--

268
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I know how you feel about me, 
and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.

269
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,300
You are?

270
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,700
Oh, yeah. 

271
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,700
I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one 
who's held down a steady job for several years.

272
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Well, it's-- 
it's interesting work, I don't mind it.

273
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,900
Don't you have a boyfriend? 
A burly, athletic type?

274
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,500
Cool?
- Very cool. 

275
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
So, what do you say? 
Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?

276
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,500
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. 

277
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,500
But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, 
and I have given the coat to her.

278
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,600
All right, we're done here.

279
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,200
For I am in love with Svetlana, 
and I don't care if the whole world knows. 

280
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,700
Except for Silvio, 
who would throw me out of the apartment, 

281
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--

282
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Thank you. Thank you very much.

283
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,200
Nice carryall.

284
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,500
It's European.

285
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,700
Do you still have my lipstick?

286
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Uh, yeah, I think I do. 

287
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,900
I can never find anything in here. 

288
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,000
Ah, here it is.
- Thanks.

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,200
So, that Joe Mayo 
throws the worst parties, doesn't he? 

290
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
What was your job?

291
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,300
My job was to keep you away from the music.

292
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,200
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?

293
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,100
Guess not.

294
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,100
You should've been there last year. 
I got jiggy with it!

295
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,900
Kramer! It's Silvio! 

296
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Open up, I need to talk to you! 

297
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,900
I can see you through the reverse peephole.

298
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,500
Hey, Silvio!

299
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,700
Look at this.
- Huh?

300
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,100
Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, 

301
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
but I think it is a gift 
from that postman agitator. Where is he?

302
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,000
Relax, Silvio.

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No, that's it. 
You're both out of the building!

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,400
Oh, come on! 
Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! 

305
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,800
No, that's not even a woman's coat. 
It's a man's!

306
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,300
A man's?
- Yeah.

307
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,000
What kind of a man would wear fur?

308
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Oh, lots of 'em.

309
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,800
Would you?

310
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,100
No.

311
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,600
Then who?

312
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,300
What about Jerry?

313
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,900
Jerry?

314
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,100
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. 

315
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,100
They wear a lot of furs. 
They're desperate, insecure people.

316
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Yes, you are right. 
It's all about "me, me, me". 

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
"Please, look at me! 
I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!"

318
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,000
Something like that.

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,100
I have to do what?

320
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,900
All you have to do is wear the fur, 
so Silvio thinks it's yours.

321
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
I'm not wearing the fur.

322
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,300
Well, then, Newman and I, 
we get thrown out of the building.

323
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Is that right?

324
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,900
All right.

325
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Why don't you just take a good, hard look at 
what your life will be like if I'm not around?

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,900
Newman, too?

327
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, come on, man! 

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,200
I'll tell you what, if you do this, 
I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.

329
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,700
That's my walkman!

330
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
And you'll get it back.

331
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,800
All right.
- All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.

332
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Hey.

333
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Oh, hey, and by the way--
that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.

334
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,100
George, did you get that chair yet?

335
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,300
It gets here when it gets here. 
Would you stop riding me?

336
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,900
You know what? 
Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.

337
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,000
Excuse me?

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,300
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. 
He's not getting a gift from me.

339
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,200
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. 

340
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,100
So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?

341
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo 
everyone's talking about?

342
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, 
remember? It was your suggestion.

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. 
But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. 

344
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,900
And frankly, it sounds made up.

345
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,400
Oh, so now I have to buy the whole chair by myself?

346
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,800
No, you don't have to buy anything.

347
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,500
I already bought it! 

348
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I've been lying to you for three days, 
and now you're all screwing me!

349
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,800
I don't understand. 
Why didn't you tell us you had it?

350
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,200
I needed it! 
My back is... a little tweaked.

351
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,800
Because of your giant wallet. 
Just get rid of it!

352
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,900
Never! It is a part of me. 

353
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,900
I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, 
because the receipt is in my good friend.

354
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Your good friend is morbidly obese.

355
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,900
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.

356
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,900
It's not a purse. 
It's European!

357
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,400
All right, Silvio's down there. 
He's shoveling the walk. 

358
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
All you gotta do is put this on, go down to the corner, 
pick up a paper, and come right back.

359
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,300
All right.

360
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,000
There you go.

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
How do I look?

362
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Odd.

363
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Learn guitar, first lesson free?

364
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!

365
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll 
in my favorite fur coat.

366
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
That is your coat?

367
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,100
It sure is.

368
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer 
and you're desperate for attention.

369
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
That's true.

370
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,800
Jerry, you forgot your purse.

371
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,300
Oh, thanks.

372
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, 
prancing around in his coat with his purse.

373
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.

374
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,000
Maybe this isn't my coat.

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
All right, you're not fancy!

376
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
No, he's very fancy! 
"Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!"

377
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Jerry, where'd you get it? 
That's his coat.

378
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
No, it's not. 
It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.

379
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
No, that's not your coat.

380
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
If that is not his coat, 
whose coat is it?

381
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
It's Joe Mayo's coat.

382
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,700
Who's Joe Mayo?

383
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,700
That must be the man 
that's sleeping with your wife.

384
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,000
Hey! Officer! 

385
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
Someone took my European carryall!

386
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,200
Your what?

387
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,800
The... black leather thing with a strap.

388
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,900
You mean a purse?

389
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!

390
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?

391
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, he was waiting inside his apartment for him 
with a sock full of pennies.

392
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,500
He should have had a reverse peephole.

393
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,800
Hey, Babe.

394
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,700
Hello? Hello?

395
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,200
What is that?

396
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,100
It's my new coat.

397
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
You ditched the fur?

398
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,100
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. 
He looked like a bit of a dandy. 

399
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,800
Check it out! 8-Ball! 

400
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,800
You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.

401
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,100
You're gonna wear this all the time?

402
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,100
All signs point to "Yes!"
