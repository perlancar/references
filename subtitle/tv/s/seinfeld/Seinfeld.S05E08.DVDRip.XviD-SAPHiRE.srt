1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,833
The old-fashioned barbershop...

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,731
...is, unfortunately, becoming a thing
of the past. What went wrong?

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:14,073
First of all, he needs a $20,000 chair
to make a three dollar tip.

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,978
l say, cut back on the chair,
update the magazines.

5
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,346
Why do barbers always display
that license?

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,182
There's no laws in haircutting...

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,086
...except show every customer
the back of their head.

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,653
l don't wanna see the back.

9
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,557
Why see something that l'm never
gonna see at any other time?

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,095
When l buy pants...

11
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,326
...two salesmen don't lift me up and
go, ''How do you like the crotch?''

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,994
lf l wanted to see everything,
l would've been a fly.

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,506
Well, George, we here at Sanalac...

14
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,204
...like to think of ourselves
as fairly progressive.

15
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,782
We have a small but prestigious
group of clients.

16
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:56,217
A lot of people consider me
small and prestigious.

17
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,954
That's funny, George.

18
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,820
-You're very quick.
-Oh, well.

19
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,518
l feel like l don't<i>....</i>

20
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,425
l don't have to explain
every little thing to you.

21
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,293
You understand everything
immediately.

22
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,628
l enjoy understanding.

23
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,901
l want you to have this job.

24
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,904
-Of course--
-Stu Zimmer's on line two.

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,134
Great. Thanks.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,676
l've gotta take this call. Listen...

27
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,905
...l'm really glad that you came in.

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,279
''l want you to have this job.

29
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,078
Of course<i>....</i>''

30
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,788
-Yeah?
-That's it.

31
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,787
-What do you mean?
-What?

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,656
He never finished. He got a call.
That was the end.

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,458
-''Of course'' was the last thing?
-Maybe he was gonna say:

34
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,328
''Of course, l have to check
with my associates.''

35
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:45,665
''l want you to have this job.
Of course, the board of directors...

36
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,069
...is under indictment
and will be serving time.''

37
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,267
''l want you to have this job.
Of course, sodomy is a prerequisite.''

38
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,537
All right. All right.

39
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,340
Why don't you just call him.

40
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,780
He made a big deal about how
l understand everything immediately.

41
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,214
That's what impressed him.

42
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,355
So if you call to ask if you have
the job, you might lose it.

43
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,619
-lf l don't call<i>....</i>
-You have it, but you'll never know it.

44
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,989
-What kind of company?
-Rest stop supply.

45
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,859
Oh, good for you.

46
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,499
-Yeah, yeah.
-Hey.

47
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,134
-Hey.
-Hey.

48
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,294
-Shower?
-Haircut. l'm very happy with this.

49
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,235
-Who'd you use? Gino?
-Of course.

50
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,898
-Wouldn't let that butcher cut my hair.
-What butcher?

51
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,637
The uncle. Enzo.
That's the guy Jerry uses.

52
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,146
l've been going to him for 1 2 years.
l can't switch. l'd hurt his feelings.

53
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,149
-You never get good haircuts.
-You can get a good one today.

54
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,516
lt's Enzo's day off.
Gino's there all by himself.

55
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,917
-Really?
-Yeah.

56
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,060
You should go get one, to look good
for my bachelor auction.

57
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,592
What bachelor auction?

58
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,323
This thing where they auction
off dates with bachelors for charity.

59
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,830
And you didn't ask me?

60
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,663
l could raise enough money
to cure polio.

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,370
They've had a cure for polio
for quite some time.

62
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,173
Polio?

63
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:00,040
Will you go ahead?
You need a haircut.

64
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,510
-Okay.
-Yeah.

65
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,710
-What are you all dressed up for?
-Job interview.

66
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,114
-Yeah? How'd it go?
-Good.

67
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,312
Of course<i>....</i>

68
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,255
-Oh, Jerry!
-Hi, Enzo.

69
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,865
-You come for the haircut?
-No.

70
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,729
-Actually, l was--
-lt's my day off.

71
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:26,133
But l take care of you
because you my favorite customer.

72
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,638
You been with me for so long.

73
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,207
You so loyal.

74
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,140
Well<i>....</i>

75
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,644
-lf it's your day off--
-What's the difference?

76
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,544
-lt takes 1 0 minutes.
-Well, it's<i>....</i>

77
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,480
Jerry, today l'm gonna do
something special for you.

78
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,057
-l don't wanna take too much off.
-Hey, who's your barber, huh?

79
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,754
You tell the joke. l cut the hair.

80
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,899
Gino, you've outdone yourself
this time.

81
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,127
This is the best haircut
l've ever had.

82
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,083
-He massacred you!
-l know.

83
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,153
You look like you're 5 years old.

84
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,850
What if l shampoo?
Sometimes a shampoo helps.

85
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,721
You gotta start seeing
somebody else.

86
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,089
Get out of this relationship.

87
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,564
l can't. He loves me.
He says l'm his most loyal customer.

88
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,261
Plus, he's on the corner. l'd have
to pass him every day when l go by.

89
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,100
-Well, you gotta do it.
-l can't, l can't. l'd break his heart.

90
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,371
No way my Gino did that.

91
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,613
-lt's an Enzo.
-You told me he wouldn't be there.

92
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,911
-So what?
-So l didn't wanna hurt his feelings.

93
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,613
You can't continue seeing him.
You're destroying yourself.

94
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,057
l'm not gonna let you.
Now, if you don't call him, l will.

95
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,322
No, no, Kramer, you can't do that.

96
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,729
l'll call Gino. You'll see him.
We're gonna get that haircut fixed.

97
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,870
-l don't want you to call him.
-All right.

98
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,301
You're crazy.

99
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,934
So l still haven't heard
about that job.

100
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,635
That's a tough one.
What are you gonna do about that?

101
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,208
Well, l have an idea.

102
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,817
-Yeah?
-l show up.

103
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,445
-What do you mean, you show up?
-l show up.

104
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,717
l pretend l have the job.

105
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,056
The guy's on vacation.
lf l have the job, it's fine.

106
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,165
lf l don't, by the time he comes back,
l'm ensconced.

107
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,500
-Not bad.
-What's the worst that could happen?

108
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,038
You'd be embarrassed and humiliated
in front of a large group of people...

109
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,177
...and have to walk out in shame
with your tail between your legs.

110
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,045
Yeah. So?

111
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,510
Yeah. l see what you mean.
l forgot who l was dealing with.

112
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,254
Good morning. Morning.

113
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,418
Good morning.

114
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,525
Morning. Hi. Nice to see you.
How are you?

115
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,161
Good morning. Good morning.

116
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,891
Good morning.

117
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,226
-How can l help you?
-The name's George Costanza.

118
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,666
l'm starting work here today.
l was wondering if you could...

119
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,500
-...tell me where my office is?
-l wasn't aware that--

120
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,938
Mike. This is George Costanza.

121
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,010
He's starting here today.

122
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,736
Welcome aboard.

123
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,540
Thanks, Mike. Nice to be aboard.

124
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,115
l didn't know Mr. Tuttle
was finished interviewing.

125
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,515
Oh, he was probably just
getting anxious to start his vacation.

126
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,124
-He wants to know where his office is.
-Oh, well<i>....</i>

127
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,759
Let's see. We've got two.

128
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,657
There's the big one down the hall
and the small one here.

129
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,230
-l should ask Jack.
-Oh, leave Jack alone.

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Jack's got enough problems.

131
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,994
-l'll just take the small office.
-Really?

132
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,798
Yes. l like to feel cozy.

133
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,942
l have a small apartment.
l like to feel tucked in, nestled in.

134
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,804
Love to be nestled.

135
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,344
All right. lt's 808, right down there.

136
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,006
Meanwhile, l'll get you the Pensky file.
You can start working on that.

137
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,118
Yes, of course. The Pensky file.

138
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,846
Can't wait to sink my teeth into that.

139
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,717
Wow, that Pensky.

140
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,485
Well, we'll straighten him out.

141
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,537
What do you do there all day?

142
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,468
They gave me the Pensky file.

143
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,240
-So it's a nice place to work?
-You know, l'm enjoying it very much.

144
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,677
l think my coworkers
are really taking to me.

145
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,339
We're like a family.

146
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,509
<i>In fact, yesterday</i>
<i>was Grace's birthday.</i>

147
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,985
<i>She's such a sweet woman.</i>

148
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,092
<i>We had a little party</i>
<i>with cake and champagne.</i>

149
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,321
<i>I made a toast.</i>

150
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,994
What about your boss,
the guy who interviewed you?

151
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,697
He'll be back on Monday.

152
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,364
-Hi.
-Hey.

153
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,901
How come you're wearing a hat?

154
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,041
l got a haircut.

155
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,337
Oh, yeah? Can l see it?

156
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,510
There's nothing to see.

157
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,706
-Come on. Let me see it.
-Forget it.

158
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,352
Come on.

159
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,545
All right.

160
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,704
Very good. Thank you.

161
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,538
l'm sorry.

162
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,612
l'm sorry.

163
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,844
You can forget about me going
to that bachelor auction.

164
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,577
What? No, Jerry. You have to go.

165
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,451
You know, Elaine, l'd do it,
but l'm working that day.

166
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,990
Yeah. Too bad.

167
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,196
This is the worst haircut
Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.

168
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,164
Sure.

169
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,396
l fix. But you gotta make sure
you no tell anybody.

170
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,368
He's a little crazy.

171
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,601
l don't know what he do
if he find out l touch Jerry's hair.

172
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,512
So, l love that
<i>Edward Scissorhands.</i>

173
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,342
That's the best movie l ever see.

174
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,377
Again with the
<i>Edward Scissorhands.</i>

175
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,987
How can you have a hand
like a scissor?

176
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,454
Show me one person who's got
a hand like a scissor.

177
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,788
Hey, it's a beautiful dream.
l love to be this man.

178
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:00,922
Did you ever think about what
you're going to do on the toilet?

179
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,194
What are you going to do
on the toilet?!

180
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,134
l'd like to have shoehorn hands.

181
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,705
-Hey.
-Hey.

182
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,142
-Hey.
-Okay, now listen to me.

183
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,441
l talked to Gino. He'll fix the haircut.

184
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,283
Great. Then you can go
to the bachelor auction.

185
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,011
-Yeah, but--
-No buts.

186
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,554
His apartment tonight, 8:00.

187
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,818
-Can he fix it?
-l don't know.

188
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:35,730
Boy, you got a beautiful head of hair.

189
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,129
Well, thank you.

190
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,795
l bet Uncle Enzo,
he tell you that all the time.

191
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,773
Actually, Enzo hasn't said that
to me in a while.

192
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:50,210
l don't think Uncle Enzo realize
what a lucky barber he is.

193
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,874
That's nice of you to say.

194
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,553
Just a second.

195
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,891
-Yes?
-<i>It's your Uncle Enzo.</i>

196
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,555
lt's Uncle Enzo! Quick.
Go in there. l'll clean up.

197
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,162
Come on up.

198
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,777
Uncle Enzo,
what are you doing here?

199
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,886
-l come to apologize.
-Apologize?

200
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,888
l rented the movie
<i>Edward Scissorhands.</i>

201
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,526
That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.

202
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,788
He make me cry too.
You want something to drink?

203
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,830
Hey! What's all this?

204
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,862
Nothing. lt's just hair.

205
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,700
-You do haircut in the apartment?
-No.

206
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,867
Pizza man was here.
Maybe some fall off.

207
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,036
He's going bald.

208
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,110
lt looks very familiar.

209
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,558
ln the one minute he worked on me,
l could tell he was good.

210
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,628
Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.

211
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,559
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

212
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,168
-Didn't l tell you?
-But Enzo picked up one of my hairs.

213
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,098
-Yeah? So?
-l think he knew.

214
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,137
-No, he doesn't know.
-He knows my hair.

215
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,434
You're imagining things.
He doesn't know a thing.

216
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,238
-Come on. Pull yourself together.
-Okay, okay.

217
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,943
What happened?
lt looks the same.

218
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,815
He didn't get to finish. His uncle
came in. We almost got caught!

219
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,351
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.

220
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,756
-Take the K-Man.
-Yeah.

221
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,327
You can still go.

222
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,700
What, are you kidding?
Look at him. He's grotesque.

223
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,837
-Do you think?
-Do l think? He's repugnant.

224
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,167
-What would you wear?
-Whatever it takes.

225
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,313
See, Newman is a good customer.

226
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,979
Once l find a barber, l stick with him.
l almost went to barber school.

227
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,352
l always felt l had a talent for it.

228
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,188
Not everybody like Newman,
so loyal.

229
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,058
Yeah, just the way that l was raised.

230
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,466
l'm special.

231
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,829
You know, l don't mind
if somebody's funny...

232
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,201
...but l no like the funny business.

233
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,878
l'm gonna go out for a little bit.

234
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,210
-l'll be right back.
-Take your time.

235
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,021
You happy with the haircut?

236
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,126
lt's okay. A little crooked.

237
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,385
How you like to have a free haircut
for six months?

238
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,625
-What's the catch?
-You get me a sample of Jerry's hair.

239
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,999
That job sounds like
it might be worth...

240
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:04,108
...a year's free haircuts.
And a comb.

241
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,351
<i>Mr. Costanza,</i>
<i>Mr. Pensky's here to see you.</i>

242
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,083
Mr. Pensky?

243
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,591
Of the Pensky file?

244
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,558
Costanza?

245
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,129
Arthur Pensky.

246
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,129
Mr. Pensky.

247
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,803
l-- l was just working on your file.

248
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,199
l was...

249
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,034
...transferring the contents
of the file into this...

250
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,699
...flexible, accordion-style folder to--

251
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,108
-Where's Tuttle?
-He's on vacation.

252
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,114
He was on vacation the last time
l dropped by. Give me my file.

253
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,346
Looks like you put
a lot of work into this.

254
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,118
Well, in college they used to call me
''the little bulldog.''

255
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,695
Yeah, you are Pensky material.

256
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,459
Would you ever consider
coming to work directly for me?

257
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,967
-Really?
-You are aware--

258
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,832
-<i>Mr. Costanza?</i>
-Not now, Clarisse.

259
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,464
<i>I thought Mr. Pensky should know</i>
<i>they're towing his car.</i>

260
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,110
Damn this city!

261
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,803
l am aware...? l am aware...?

262
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,475
He knows. He knows about us.

263
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,243
-How do you know?
-Because l know.

264
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,152
He's crazy. All morning, he looking
at the hair. He staring at the hair.

265
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,917
-Who is it?
-lt's Newman!

266
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,756
He was in the shop with Enzo.
He can't see me here.

267
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,458
Go in the bedroom. Open the window.
You can go out the fire escape.

268
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,000
-What do you want?
-Could l use your bathroom?

269
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,942
What's wrong with yours?

270
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,101
-My toilet's clogged.
-You can't unclog it?

271
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,810
-Did you ask Kramer?
-He's out.

272
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,608
-Number one?
-Yes, yes.

273
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,511
-May l go?
-Go ahead.

274
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,585
-l gotta go very badly.
-Flush twice.

275
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,482
Thank you!

276
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,153
<i>No.</i>

is a hell of a barber.

291

Oh, you done good, Newman.

297

Okay, why don't we start
the bidding.

324
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,146
Do l hear 5 bucks?

325
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:16,515
l don't get this Scissorhands. ls he
a superhero? Like Green Lantern?

326
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,019
What's with this guy?

327
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,923
l'm just asking.

328
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,862
-Who is it?
-Enzo Manganero!

329
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,999
Oh, my God!

330
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,396
One second!
Go. Go in the bedroom.

331
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,437
lt was you that was at Gino's
apartment the other night!

332
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,310
-No, l wasn't there.
-Don't lie!

333
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,883
l know it was you!

334
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,543
l get a sample of your hair.
l match them up.

335
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,279
Sample?

336
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,185
Newman.

337
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,790
l was there, but l was just
dropping off a book.

338
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,191
Don't, Jerry.

339
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,594
So, it's true!

340
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,598
Yes.

341
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,600
ls true.

342
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,073
l'm gonna kill the both of you!

343
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,916
Mr. Tuttle! You're back.

344
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,992
George.

345
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,219
l'm surprised to find you here.

346
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,221
-You are?
-l thought you'd take the larger office.

347
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,896
Really?

348
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,231
l guess l didn't make it clear
when l hired you.

349
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,965
So where's that Pensky file?

350
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,511
Let's see what you've been
up to all week.

351
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,906
Here it is.

352
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,911
What have you been
doing all week?

353
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,318
You missed a lovely party for Grace.

354
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,481
You haven't done anything with this.

355
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,195
Well, bear in mind,
l am in the smaller office.

356
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,827
l'm beginning to wonder
if you understand anything.

357
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,664
You are aware that Pensky
is interested in me.

358
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,201
You're not Pensky material.

359
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,776
Really? Well, we'll just
see about that.

360
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,347
Ta-ta, Tuttle.

361
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,700
Jerry.

362
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,924
George, l'm sorry l gave you
the wrong impression.

363
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,924
What l was gonna say was:

364
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:15,499
Now, you are aware that our
board of directors has been indicted...

365
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,066
...myself included.

366
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,869
We're prohibited from doing business
until the investigation is completed.

367
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,872
So obviously...

368
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,874
...we would have no use for you.

369
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,044
Obviously.

370
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:34,284
-Yes?
-<i>Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.</i>

371
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,491
So when are you gonna
be able to go out?

372
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,164
Not for a while.
