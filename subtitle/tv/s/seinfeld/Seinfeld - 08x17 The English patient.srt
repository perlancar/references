1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:08,574
You know at the movies they show
that ad for the concessions?

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,939
Where the cartoon candy's dancing
and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,807
-Oh, he's wailing on that banjo.
-Yeah.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,107
I just don't understand
the Raisinets.

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,011
-The sax player? Yeah.
-Yeah.

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,919
The box of Raisinets runs
up to the concession stand...

7
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,282
...buys another box of Raisinets.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,824
-So?
-Box of Raisinets eating...

9
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,187
...another box of Raisinets?

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,589
It's perverse.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,520
He's not gonna eat them.

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,394
He's buying them
for his Pepsi girlfriend.

13
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,536
And why is he dating a Pepsi?
They're not having children.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,331
They're musicians.

15
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,098
Musicians.

16
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,572
Get a real job.

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,176
-What do you want?
-I've had everything on the menu.

18
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,116
Surprise me.

19
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,714
Neil, Neil.

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,555
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to
meet my boyfriend here.

21
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,321
He looks just like you.

22
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,124
-Really?
-Yeah.

23
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,293
-Like me?
-Yeah, sorry.

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,098
Like me?

25
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,907
But how?

26
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,409
Here's your halibut omelet.

27
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,640
-Surprised?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

28
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,910
Look what I got for you
for your Florida trip.

29
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,152
Crazy Shirts was closing them out.
I got a dozen for a buck.

30
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,684
I saved a fortune. Look at that.

31
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,089
There you go.

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,829
-"Number-one dad."
-Yeah.

33
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,660
And it's a medium. Perfect.

34
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,929
-Hey. Hey. You ready?
-Almost.

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,369
Look, when you're
in Florida, can my cigar guy...

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,667
...drop off some Cubans
for me at your parents'?

37
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,970
I'm helping my parents
move into their new condo.

38
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,808
-I'm gonna be busy.
-Oh, come on, man, help a brother out.

39
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,347
-All right.
-Yeah. I owe you one.

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,986
We're even.

41
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,017
Hey, Jerry, figure this out.

42
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,680
I'm in the coffee shop...

43
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,760
...and this beautiful girl
I could never even talk to...

44
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,987
...mistakes me for her boyfriend.

45
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,462
That's a nice four seconds.

46
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,535
I look just like him. I, me, this.

47
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,366
This is what her boyfriend looks like.
How is that possible?

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,667
-Maybe he has money.
-Maybe he doesn't.

49
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,605
Maybe he and I are
exactly the same...

50
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,507
...except for one minor
yet crucial detail.

51
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,041
-You never know.
-Sometimes you do.

52
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,977
Maybe it's some--
Some small thing I could change.

53
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,555
Like a mustache
or wearing a top hat...

54
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,192
...or a monocle or a cane.

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,827
Who's she dating? Mr. Peanut?

56
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,758
You could do a lot worse than
Mr. Peanut, my friend.

57
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,969
So, what do you want to see?

58
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,401
How about Sack Lunch?

59
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,437
How about The English Patient?
It's up for all those Oscars.

60
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,273
Come on, Blaine, I mean,
look at the poster for Sack Lunch.

61
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,241
It's a family in a brown paper bag.

62
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,785
Don't you wanna know
how they got in there?

63
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,215
No.

64
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,185
-Oh, sold out.
-Oh, two for The English Patient.

65
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,759
So do you think they got shrunk down,
or is it just a giant sack?

66
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,826
Hi, remember me?

67
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,938
I'm the guy that looks like Neil.

68
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,097
-Hi.
-Hi.

69
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,937
Is Neil here?

70
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,703
Oh, no, he got held up at work.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,814
Oh, that's too bad.
I wanted to meet him...

72
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,415
...seeing as we look so similar.

73
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,713
Well, you know, you don't look
that much like him.

74
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,955
-Of course not.
-No, you're a little taller.

75
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,499
You look like you're in better shape
than Neil. Do you work out?

76
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,802
Listen, l-- I don't mean
to seem forward...

77
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,872
...but is there any way
that I could possibly...

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,372
...have Neil's phone number?

79
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,135
What is everyone talking about:

80
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,111
"The English Patient,
it's so romantic"?

81
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,013
God, that movie stunk.

82
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,483
I kind of liked it.

83
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,246
No, you didn't.

84
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,085
Elaine, Blaine, did you just see
The English Patient?

85
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,818
Didn't you love it?

86
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,828
-No.
-How could you not love that movie?

87
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,161
How about, it sucked.

88
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:34,367
That Ralph Fiennes. I would give up
my firstborn for him.

89
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,974
He's getting the short end
of that stick.

90
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,138
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's
new physical fitness room.

91
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,182
They got medicine balls.
You can bike ride.

92
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,013
-Anything you want.
-StairMaster?

93
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,848
-What?
-Nothing.

94
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,020
-See what I'm wearing?
-Oh, did you get that out of my bag?

95
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,160
No, your mother found it.

96
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,660
Son, this is the most wonderful...

97
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,162
...and thoughtful thing
you've ever done for me.

98
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,325
You know, I bought you
a Cadillac. Twice.

99
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,334
Oh, here he is.

100
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,202
This is the man I wanted you to see.

101
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,607
Izzy Mandelbaum.
He's 80 years old but strong as an ox.

102
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,441
Watch this.

103
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,244
See that? You couldn't do that.

104
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,887
I could. I choose not to.

105
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,187
Hey, Morty, who's this?

106
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,451
This is my son, Jerry,
from New York.

107
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,721
-He thinks he can lift more than lzzy.
-I didn't say that.

108
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,958
Hey, lzzy, this kid says he can
lift more than you can.

109
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,103
Hey, your kid's pretty funny, Morty.
He should be a comedian.

110
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,264
-Actually, I am a comedian.
-That's not so funny.

111
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,435
Think you're better than me, huh?

112
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,842
Izzy used to work out
with Charles Atlas in the '50s.

113
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,710
1 850s?

114
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,876
Well, that's it. It's go time.
Let's see you lift that.

115
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,521
-Mr. Mandelbaum--
-Come on.

116
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,249
-Pump it.
-All right.

117
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,486
Wrong attitude. You're not bringing
that trash into my house.

118
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,257
There. All right?

119
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,593
Step aside, string bean.

120
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,497
I'll show you.

121
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,138
I'm gonna take it up a notch.

122
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,104
My back.

123
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,375
Somebody call an ambulance.

124
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,076
There's already an ambulance here
for Mrs. Glickman.

125
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,484
There's room for one more.

126
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,417
Hey, one for Sack Lunch.
It's good, right?

127
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,825
Yeah, good.

128
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,489
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

129
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,566
We just saw
The English Patient again.

130
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,600
It's even better the second time.

131
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,295
They make it longer?

132
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,064
Forgot my umbrella.

133
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,141
-Blaine.
-Elaine.

134
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,970
You said you were busy tonight.

135
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,343
To tell you the truth, Elaine.

136
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,847
I don't know if I can be with someone
who doesn't like The English Patient.

137
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,110
It's just a stupid movie.

138
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,745
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Come on, Blaine.

139
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,288
Let's go.

140
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,619
Enjoy Sack Lunch.

141
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,659
I will.

142
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,995
How could you do that
to Mr. Mandelbaum?

143
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,794
-You should be ashamed of yourself.
-He egged me on.

144
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,801
-You should be more mature.
-He's 80.

145
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:23,635
Okay. Tomorrow Jerry and l
will visit lzzy and apologize.

146
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,142
-Now, good night.
-You're not sleeping in that shirt.

147
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,506
It's too tight.

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,706
-This shirt will never leave my body.
-Good night.

149
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,742
All right, 7:30,
got the place to myself.

150
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,388
-Jerry Seinfeld, please.
-You must be Kramer's guys.

151
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,324
-Come on in. You got the cigars?
-What cigars?

152
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,157
Kramer said to bring him
some Cubans.

153
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,322
We are the Cubans.

154
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,332
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.

155
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,068
They're real Cubans?

156
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,043
They're human beings from Cuba?

157
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,877
I said Cubans.
What did you think I meant?

158
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,916
Cigars.

159
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,615
Jerry, Cuban cigars
are illegal in this country.

160
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,386
-That's why I got these guys.
-You're making your own cigars now?

161
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,256
Yeah, I got investors all lined up.

162
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,921
Hold on a second. Hi, Dad.

163
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,033
-Who are they?
-They're Cuban cigar rollers.

164
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,828
Don't tell your mother.

165
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,401
What is that bubbling sound?
Are you making your tomato sauce?

166
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,708
-Yeah, hot and spicy.
-You're not wearing a shirt, are you?

167
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,342
Yes, I am.

168
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,679
What color is it?

169
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,911
Damn it.

170
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,184
You know, you could have just
given me Neil's number.

171
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,189
You didn't have to
take me out to dinner.

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,920
I wanted to give it to you in person.

173
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,395
I don't have to be up in the morning
and I know a great breakfast place...

174
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,124
...right around the corner.

175
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,436
Does Neil like to
eat a big breakfast?

176
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,766
Why don't you come in?
We'll talk about it.

177
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,169
I really should get going.

178
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,606
I wanna be home in case Neil calls.

179
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,979
Well, good night.

180
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,845
I'll see you.

181
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,147
Rough night?

182
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,950
You wouldn't believe it.

183
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,922
My boyfriend dumped me.

184
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,685
My friends, who I don't even like...

185
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,194
...they won't talk to me,
all because I don't like...

186
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,491
...that stupid English Patient movie.

187
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,965
Really? I thought it was pretty good.

188
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,535
Oh, come on.

189
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,501
Good? What was good about it?

190
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:37,337
Those sex scenes. I mean, please.

191
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,445
Give me something I can use.

192
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,839
Well, I liked it.

193
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,012
You forgot about my piece of pie.

194
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,711
Hello?

195
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,986
You know, sex in a tub.
That doesn't work.

196
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,659
This is quite a condo.

197
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,929
The Mandelbaums own
the Magic Pan restaurants.

198
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,165
-The crepe place?
-Yeah, this is all big crepe money.

199
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,639
There's crepe money?

200
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,806
What are you doing here?

201
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,640
Mr. Mandelbaum,
I wanted to come by...

202
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,805
...tell you how sorry I was
you hurt yourself.

203
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,780
What the hell is that?

204
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,010
-What?
-That shirt.

205
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,451
You think that you
are the number-one dad?

206
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,614
This was a gift from my son.

207
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,919
Oh, I see how it works now.

208
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,495
He knocks me out of commission...

209
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,964
...so you can strut around
in your fancy number-one shirt.

210
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,738
Well, I'll show you
who's number one.

211
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,636
-Mr. Mandelbaum, please.
-It's go time.

212
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,637
My back-- I can't move.

213
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:53,184
-Call an ambulance.
-Think I saw one a couple doors down.

214
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,589
So she wanted you to come up...

215
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,093
...but you left because you thought
some guy might be calling you?

216
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,560
Some guy, some guy?

217
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,323
Neil.

218
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:11,032
I have got to find out
how he could get a girl like Danielle.

219
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,104
George, you've got Danielle.
Forget about Neil.

220
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,002
You've "out-Neiled" him.

221
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,006
So I'm Neil. How did I do that?

222
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,908
I don't know,
but you better keep it up.

223
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,443
I'm gonna go meet Danielle.

224
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,142
There's a new Neil in town.

225
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,649
I try take a vacation. I come back,
the whole operation's in shambles.

226
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,591
-Hello.
-Hey, Jerry. Number one here.

227
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,697
Did you go see lzzy
at the back specialist?

228
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,198
-I will. I just walked in the door.
-You have to go see him.

229
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,633
-Ma.
-Helen, will you stop bothering him?

230
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,568
Jerry, that shirt has gone
to his head.

231
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,402
Number one, signing off.

232
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,211
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans
at the bus station.

233
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,872
What's going on?

234
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,779
-What?
-They're not real Cubans.

235
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,819
-They're Dominicans.
-So?

236
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,389
So, Jerry, if my investors
don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.

237
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,756
-What's the difference?
-Jerry, once you've had real Cubans...

238
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,056
...there's just nothing else like it.

239
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,892
We're talking about people, right?

240
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,332
Yes, yes, the quality, the texture,
the intoxicating aroma.

241
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,971
These guys don't have it.

242
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,598
I thought they smelled pretty nice.

243
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,471
-Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
-ls not.

244
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,111
-ls too. Is too.
-ls not.

245
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,042
-I'm not having this conversation.
-Are too.

246
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,513
-Are too. Are too.
-Am not. Am not.

247
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,914
Another productive meeting.

248
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,016
By the way, I saw that
English Patient film last night.

249
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,025
-lt was extraordinary.
-Oh, yes, it was so romantic.

250
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,096
-lt ravished me.
-Elaine, what did you think?

251
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,102
Well, actually I haven't seen it...

252
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,933
...so I couldn't tell you
whether I liked it...

253
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,201
...or whether it really sucked.

254
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,544
-You haven't seen it?
-No.

255
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,444
That's it. Drop everything.
We're going right now.

256
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,617
Again, Mr. Mandelbaum, this back
specialist is supposed to be the best.

257
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,488
If there's anything else I can do, don't
hesitate to try and find my number.

258
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,128
Oh, wait.

259
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,724
How about that, huh?

260
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,600
The "World's Greatest Dad."

261
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,328
My son made it for me.

262
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,871
-That's very nice.
-The best in the world...

263
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,339
...which means I'm better
than just number one.

264
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,213
Well, I don't know how official
any of these rankings really are.

265
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,313
-Hi, Son.
-Hi, Daddy.

266
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,976
This is your son?

267
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,179
I got married in high school.

268
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,152
Hey, who are you?

269
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,225
This is Seinfeld's kid.

270
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,522
Oh, you think you're tough,
picking on an old man?

271
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,692
Maybe you'd like to try taking on
somebody your own age.

272
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,927
You got any kids?

273
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,930
Oh, you think you're
better than me?

274
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,234
Go ahead, pick out anything
in the room here.

275
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,435
I'll lift it up over my head.

276
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,944
Look, no one is lifting anything.

277
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,207
The television.

278
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,851
This one's for you, Pop. It's go time.

279
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,857
Oh, my back.

280
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,586
-Call an ambulance.
-We're already in a hospital.

281
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,360
All right, partner.
Let's get down to business.

282
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,434
Okay. Well, I'll--
I'll get the Cubans.

283
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,865
They're right out here.

284
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,871
Yeah, here they are.
They're Cubans, real Cubans.

285
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,478
You wouldn't be trying to sell
old Earl Haffler...

286
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,210
...Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper,
now, would you?

287
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,320
Oh, come on, look at these boys.

288
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,322
If they were any more Cuban, Castro
would have smoked them himself.

289
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,793
-We're talking about people, right?
-I think so.

290
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,724
I thought he quit smoking cigars.

291
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,394
Well, yeah, yeah, but they also rolled
for his brother, Dennis.

292
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,771
-Dennis Castro?
-Dwayne.

293
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,210
-Get the hell out of my office.
-What?

294
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,419
-You know, Neil called me today.
-Really?

295
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,420
Yeah, he's pretty upset I broke up
with him to go out with you.

296
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,684
Well, I guess I showed
Neil who's Neil.

297
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,090
He wanted to get together
tomorrow and have coffee.

298
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,820
Coffee?

299
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,625
I can beat that. Move in with me.

300
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,763
-What?
-lt beats the hell out of coffee.

301
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,436
And I thought I knew what love was.

302
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,749
-You asked her to move in with you?
-I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.

303
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,621
What if it's Neil Armstrong?

304
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,925
Then I'm going to Mars.

305
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:10,027
-What if it's Neil Diamond?
-Oh, shut up, Jerry, just shut up.

306
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,136
All right, I gotta go back
to the hospital.

307
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,239
-What? To see the old guy?
-No, I got into a thing with the son...

308
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,669
...and now he's laid up too.

309
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,470
-How old's the son?
-I think he's the same age as the father.

310
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,241
What is with this family?

311
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,245
Don't know.
It's like, one of them dies...

312
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,577
...the other one wants to
bench-press the casket.

313
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,483
Hey, Jerry.

314
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,817
You cold?

315
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,394
-It's them, right?
-Something wrong your chin?

316
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,490
-Where?
-No, no, no, don't look.

317
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,503
Over there, the Dominicans.

318
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,037
Aren't they supposed to be
rolling cigars?

319
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,609
Well, it didn't quite work out and
now I've got nothing for them to do.

320
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,076
-So?
-So I taught them all about Cuba...

321
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,680
...and they really took to it.

322
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,080
You know, Marxism,
the workers' revolution, the clothing.

323
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,745
Boy, they seem pretty angry
about something.

324
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,516
Yeah, I'm a little worried.

325
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,956
When there's no work
and the people get restless...

326
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,119
...who do you think they come after?

327
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,199
I swear to you, I didn't know
the TV was bolted to the table.

328
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,106
I bet you pulled that trick
on my daddy in Florida.

329
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,038
He couldn't handle the weight.

330
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,202
Oh, so now you think
you're better than me?

331
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,314
You think you're better than him?

332
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:34,976
Look, let me just state for the record,
I think you're both better than me.

333
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,553
Okay.

334
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,814
My boys.

335
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,892
-My dad.
-My grandpa.

336
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,052
Oh, come on.

337
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,492
What happened to him?

338
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,633
He was trying to lift the TV.

339
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,929
-That TV?
-Oh, no.

340
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,839
It's go time.

341
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,200
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was bolted down?

342
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,176
I still thought you could do it.

343
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,575
Me too.

344
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,310
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum,
Mandelbaum.

345
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,454
Fellas, fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.

346
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,179
Oh, yeah, that's right, go.

347
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,914
Put us all in the hospital...

348
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:18,792
...and you ruined our business
with all your macho head games.

349
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,333
-I didn't ruin your business.
-Yes, you did.

350
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,904
There's nobody there now at
the Magic Pan to roll the crepes.

351
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,270
-We gotta close it up.
-Don't you hire people to do that?

352
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,840
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled
by a Mandelbaum.

353
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,450
That's what puts the magic
in Magic Pan.

354
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,779
So you just need some guys
that could roll them?

355
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,715
Yeah.

356
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,561
I think I can help you out.
I'll see you later.

357
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,130
Hey, I can't see the TV.

358
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,295
Here.

359
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,138
You think you're better than us,
don't you?

360
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,569
Elaine, I hope you're
watching the clothes...

361
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,774
...because I can't take my eyes
off the passion.

362
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,576
No, I can't do this anymore.

363
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,087
I can't. It's too long.

364
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,123
Quit telling your stupid story...

365
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:25,753
...about the stupid desert
and just die already.

366
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,796
Die!

367
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,492
Elaine, you don't like the movie?

368
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,331
I hate it!

369
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,564
Oh, go to hell!

370
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,145
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

371
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,645
-You're fired.
-Great. I'll wait for you outside.

372
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,852
He was gonna fire you?

373
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,147
Well, the only way
I could talk him out of it...

374
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,950
...was that I agreed to go
and visit the Tunisian desert.

375
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,724
-Tunisia?
-That's where they filmed the movie.

376
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,021
It's supposed to inspire me.

377
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,030
-Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
-I have to live in a cave.

378
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,434
These Dominicans really know
their way around a crepe, huh?

379
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,134
Look at that. Looks like they're
rolling a Double Corona.

380
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,404
Just a cigar made out of Bisquick,
huh, Guillermo?

381
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,146
I'm very happy with George.

382
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,715
I'm sorry, Neil.

383
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,579
It's over.

384
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,777
Come on, let's just eat our crepes.

385
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,982
My face!

386
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,056
Neil!

387
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,424
Why are the crepes spraying?

388
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,763
The Dominicans are rolling them
too tight.

389
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,666
Well, that's why you gotta get
real Cubans.

390
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,304
Danielle. Where's Neil?

391
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,974
-ls this him?
-Yeah.

392
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,142
That blueberry crepe
burned him pretty badly.

393
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,752
Whose cane is this?

394
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,515
It's Neil's.

395
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,386
Cane.

396
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,027
I knew it.

397
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,327
So we meet at last.

398
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,265
I admire your skills, Mr. Peanut.

399
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,202
Well, Danielle, we should get going.

400
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,772
I got a key made for you.

401
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,205
-George, I can't move in with you.
-What?

402
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,210
I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil
to a clinic in England.

403
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,008
No, no, you can't leave me.

404
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,276
Marry me. I'll burn myself.
I'll burn my parents.

405
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,410
Sorry, George.

406
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,022
George.

407
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,856
I win.

408
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,114
Ladies and gentlemen,
in just one moment...

409
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,760
...we'll be showing
our feature presentation.

410
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,089
No, no, no.

411
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,756
The comedy hit, Sack Lunch,
starring Dabney Coleman.

412
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:19,069
All right. Oh, this is shaping up.

413
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,671
-Excuse me, please.
-Oh, sure.

414
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,372
Ladies and gentlemen...

415
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,175
...because we have been exploited by
your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...

416
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,183
...we are hijacking
this plane to Cuba.

417
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,881
Everyone stay in your seats.

418
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,285
And shut that movie off.

419
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,958
Oh, nuts.

420
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,159
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum.
