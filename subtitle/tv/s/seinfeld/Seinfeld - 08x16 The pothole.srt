1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,833
-Morning.
-Morning.

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,199
I hope you don't mind
baking-soda flavor.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,400
Baking soda,
annoying little product.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:14,069
"l can do this, I can do that."
Why doesn't the stuff just shut up?

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,507
Let me grab you a towel.

6
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,314
-So?
-So? She used the toothbrush.

7
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,047
-You grabbed it out of there real fast?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,783
So I'm sure whatever germs
it landed on were knocked out.

9
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,824
When the rest realized
what was going on...

10
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,587
...you had already grabbed it out.

11
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,731
How many years of med school
did you have?

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,161
Was she mad?

13
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,829
-You didn't tell her.
-Jenna's like me. She's very....

14
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,633
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?

15
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,106
I'll take "fastidious."

16
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,840
What is that?

17
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,981
Steinbrenner gave them to us.

18
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,515
For Phil Rizzuto's
induction to the Hall of Fame.

19
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,482
Holy cow.

20
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,152
Do they have to squeeze his head
to get him to say "Holy cow"?

21
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,090
Just the last few innings
of a double-header.

22
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,092
Hey.

23
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,389
Look at this.

24
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,261
I'm in the passing lane of
the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway...

25
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,834
...going 70, and:

26
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,769
Dragged this thing for five exits.

27
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,341
Why didn't you pull over?

28
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,809
Well, I was drafting behind a semi.
I didn't wanna lose him.

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,881
The infrastructure, Jerry,
it's crumbling.

30
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,712
Holy cow.

31
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,710
Oh, look at that. Talking Nixon.

32
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,785
-China Panda.
-Yeah, I'd like to place an order.

33
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,155
Yes, what you like?

34
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,863
This supreme flounder, it says
"First time served in America."

35
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,795
-ls that true?
-What number?

36
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,369
-Forty-seven?
-Yeah, first time. What else?

37
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,870
-That's it.
-Address.

38
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,635
78 West 86th Street, apartment 3E.

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,008
That's south side.
Sorry, we don't deliver below 86.

40
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,479
-I'm not below.
-Yes, you are.

41
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,086
-Street itself is boundary.
-Your guy can't cross to my side?

42
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,119
If we deliver to you, then what?

43
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,850
85th Street? Wall Street?
Mexico? 84th Street?

44
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,257
All right, fine.
I'll just cross and meet him.

45
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,887
Sorry. Food only for those
who live within boundary.

46
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,909
-China Panda.
-Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,601
I'd like to place an order.

48
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,246
What you like?

49
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,277
Well, I'm a papa.

50
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,748
Bring it on.
Nothing's throwing me at this point.

51
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,949
Well, as of today,
I am a proud parent...

52
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,959
...of a one-mile stretch
of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.

53
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,565
-Oh, that Adopt-A-Highway thing.
-I'm part of the solution now, Jerry.

54
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,399
I went down there
and I checked it out this morning.

55
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,699
-Here, take a look. Mile 1 1 4.
-Oh, looks just like you.

56
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,101
Oh, I'm beaming, Jerry.

57
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,404
What do you do?
Pay to keep it clean?

58
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,137
No. They try to push you into
using their cleaning crew...

59
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,645
...with all their so-called
maintenance equipment.

60
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,306
-That old scam.
-That's why I'm doing it all myself.

61
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,918
This parenting isn't about
delegating responsibility...

62
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,315
...it's about being there.

63
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,615
At the side of the road
with a pile of garbage.

64
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,088
Quality time.

65
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,828
-Keys. I can't find my keys.
-You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?

66
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,223
-Have you seen him?
-No.

67
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,293
-Damn it.
-Come on, retrace your steps.

68
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,059
-What'd you do today?
-I got up...

69
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,568
...I was supposed to go to work,
I came here instead.

70
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,439
They're not here.
You'll have to dig up your spare set.

71
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,135
I don't have a spare set.
All my keys say "do not duplicate."

72
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:09,179
-So?
-So you can't duplicate them.

73
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,009
Sure you can. Such a sweet kid.

74
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,996
Oh, hi. China Panda?

75
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,658
Why are you waiting on the street
and not in your apartment?

76
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,135
I thought that I would
meet you halfway.

77
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,505
-Do you really live here?
-Oh, yeah.

78
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,203
There you go. You keep the change.
Bye, now.

79
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,372
I'll see you.

80
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:04,029
You know, this isn't fair.
This is address discrimination.

81
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,037
Well, I cleaned out their whole
dental-hygiene shelf.

82
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,672
So the plan is to secretly
sterilize her mouth?

83
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,778
When I'm through with her mouth,
she'll be able to eat off it.

84
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,971
Is it safe to drink bleach
if you dilute it?

85
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,084
No. Stings the throat. Anyway,
so I was coming along here.

86
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,249
I felt like a piece of cake,
you know?

87
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,322
So then I thought, "It's morning,
I should really have a muffin."

88
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,957
I like those chocolate-chip ones.

89
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,719
Then I figured, well,
they're really both cake.

90
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,353
So I sat on that bench for a little while,
20 minutes or an hour...

91
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,501
...and then I figured I'd check
and see what you were up to.

92
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,794
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The broad jump.

93
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,066
The broad jump over the pothole
on 86th Street.

94
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,806
I remember.
As I jumped over the hole...

95
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,572
-...I heard, like, a jingling sound.
-You didn't look down?

96
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,809
I was trying to stick the landing.
I know it was right around here.

97
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,881
No. No!

98
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,756
Holy-- Holy cow.

99
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,924
Poor son of a bitch.

100
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,620
It's 1 00,000 revolutions a second.

101
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:09,928
-It's the most powerful one they make.
-I feel like I'm holding a blender.

102
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,038
The engine's made
by McDonnell Douglas.

103
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,640
No, no, you keep going.
It shuts off automatically.

104
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,639
Really? It does?

105
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,176
When the battery runs out.

106
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,808
I was really happy
with my old toothbrush.

107
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,612
Oh, trust me, that one was doing
more harm than good.

108
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,753
Don't forget to use the Plax too.

109
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,692
-That stuff tastes like bleach.
-I don't know anything about that.

110
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,635
-My mouth feels so clean.
-That's the idea.

111
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,110
You know, maybe we better not.
I think I'm getting a little cold.

112
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,251
I don't wanna give you
any of my germs.

113
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,583
Okay. Thanks, I guess.

114
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,287
You still couldn't kiss her?

115
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,453
She has a taint. I can't see it,
but I know it's there.

116
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,256
Oh, so now you're finding fault
on a subatomic level.

117
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,268
Maybe if I could shrink myself down,
like in Fantastic Voyage...

118
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,134
...and get inside a microscopic
submarine, I could be sure.

119
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,174
Although if there was something there,
it might be pretty scary.

120
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,675
Of course, I would have that laser.

121
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,682
Jer, do you see where this is going?

122
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,848
Being really clean and happy?

123
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,514
Jerry, you have tendencies.

124
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,420
They were always annoying,
but they were just tendencies.

125
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:45,030
But now, if you can't kiss this girl,
I'm afraid we're talking disorder.

126
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,166
-Disorder?
-And from disorder...

127
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:52,032
...you're a quirk or two away
from full-on dementia.

128
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,697
That could hurt me.

129
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,736
Hey, there it is.

130
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,512
Should we stop and say hi?

131
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,512
-No, we've seen it.
-Yeah.

132
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:08,210
Hey, Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you
back at the house.

133
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,451
Mile 1 1 4, clean as a whistle.

134
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,614
-Yeah?
-Hi.

135
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,256
I'm your neighbor...

136
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,024
...from across the street.

137
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,453
And I was wondering if it wouldn't
be too much trouble...

138
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,692
...if I could use your apartment
to order some food.

139
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,267
What? What do you want?

140
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,336
You see, there's this
certain flounder...

141
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,906
...and they won't deliver it
to my side of the street.

142
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,641
When is that?

143
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,876
No, I just need them
to deliver it here...

144
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,914
...and I have to be
kind of inside, is all.

145
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,380
Who are you with?

146
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,782
No, actually, I'm just kind of hungry.

147
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,050
-Who let you in?
-Well, the lock was broken.

148
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,888
You just have to jiggle it,
actually, to get-- But--

149
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,463
I just need like half an hour
to an hour.

150
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,345
What's with the signs?

151
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,482
You should see the Berkhardt,
Jerry.

152
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,174
My mile is spotless.
I mean, the big stuff was easy:

153
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,412
Cinder blocks, air conditioners,
shopping carts.

154
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,525
-I just rolled them into the woods.
-Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.

155
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,488
Speed limit, 1 65 miles per hour.

156
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,655
See? They slipped a one in there.

157
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,792
Those kids with the spray paint,
God love them.

158
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,832
Hey, so? Keys?

159
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,408
No keys. And I've been
calling the city all day.

160
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,841
There's no one to call
if you wanna make a pothole.

161
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,140
I guess they leave that
to the general population.

162
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,349
I'll tell you, if the real Phil Rizzuto was
down there this wouldn't be happening.

163
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,545
-Hard to say.
-You need some roadwork done?

164
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,884
I met some maintenance guys
today on the highway.

165
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,083
-They could probably help you out.
-Really?

166
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,194
Oh, yeah. I borrowed some cones
from them...

167
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,059
...when I was sweeping
my car-pool lane.

168
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,032
-Yeah?
-It's Jenna.

169
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,530
If you guys wouldn't mind,
I would like to ward off dementia.

170
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,507
-You can hook me up with them?
-Yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow.

171
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,871
I'm gonna be
at emergency call box 784.

172
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,637
Seven-eight-four.

173
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,041
-Hey.
-Hi.

174
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,648
-How you feeling?
-Good.

175
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,745
My cold's gone. I've been
looking forward to kissing you...

176
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,717
...which I'm ready to do now,
if you are ready.

177
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,652
Okay.

178
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,927
-What?
-Nothing, I just--

179
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,191
I bruised my lip.
I was drinking a Cel-Ray...

180
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,234
...and I brought it up too fast
and I banged it into my lip.

181
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,736
And then I knocked your toothbrush
into the toilet.

182
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,340
And I wasn't able to tell you
before you could use it.

183
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,443
-What?
-I'm sorry.

184
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,546
-When were you gonna tell me this?
-Obviously never.

185
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,448
I need the "yield" sign.

186
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,018
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

187
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,623
Would you get these signs
out of here, please?

188
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,589
-You could have introduced me.
-I wouldn't know where to start.

189
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,701
Hey. Jenna. Hey.

190
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,869
There. Now something of yours
has been in the toilet.

191
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,540
What? Well, what did you
put in there?

192
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,575
Gotta run.

193
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,646
Oh, man.

194
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,252
Hello, Jenna?
Did you dunk the spatula?

195
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,892
Was it the spatula? Hello?

196
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,652
Damn it.

197
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,294
Didn't even give you a hint?

198
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,161
No, could be anything.
The whole apartment's a biohazard.

199
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,133
You know what I bet it is?
Your remote.

200
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,663
Yes, that is a definite possibility.

201
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,171
Or it could be your Walkman there.

202
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,913
-Are you just screwing with me?
-Yeah, I am.

203
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,381
-Hey.
-How's life on the road?

204
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,815
-I'm making a difference, Jerry.
-I don't doubt it.

205
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,319
You should see the smiles
on the drivers' faces.

206
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,822
I mean, you gotta look quick,
but they're there.

207
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,984
-This.
-What's this?

208
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,221
You know those annoying little bumps
on the lane lines?

209
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,161
Isn't that some kind of safety thing?

210
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,031
Well, I had to pull them up
if I'm gonna widen the lanes.

211
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,630
What the hell are you talking about?

212
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,867
Well, you know how in planes
they got first class?

213
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,340
More legroom, better ride?

214
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,208
Well, I'm bringing that concept
to mile 1 1 4.

215
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,508
How are you gonna
widen the lanes?

216
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,742
Well, you black out lane lines
one and three...

217
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,185
...and a four-lane highway
becomes a two-lane comfort cruise.

218
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,722
So you got any black paint?

219
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,690
Yeah, in my tool shed,
next to the riding mower.

220
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:21,265
Yeah, I'd like an order
of supreme flounder, number 47.

221
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,163
Yeah, apartment 1 Q.

222
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,236
1 Q? Whose apartment is that?

223
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,566
That's the janitor closet...

224
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,675
...across the street.

225
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,210
You're pretending to live in a janitor's
closet just to get this flounder?

226
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,714
It's better than eating it alone
in the restaurant like some loser.

227
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,250
That stuff is unbelievable.
I'd eat it out of a dumpster.

228
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,219
How do you know about it?
You're not in the delivery zone.

229
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,826
Newman uses his mail truck...

230
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,053
...to run fish for China Panda
on the weekends.

231
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,064
Well, mine's coming in 1 0,
so I'll see you boys.

232
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,064
Now, where's that tool shed
of yours?

233
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,410
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I was in the shower.

234
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,913
I'll see you.

235
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,787
-You Costanza?
-Yeah.

236
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,619
Thanks for coming by, fellas.

237
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,752
Yeah, got a set of keys
buried in the pothole.

238
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,123
-What are the keys doing in there?
-Just need to dig them up.

239
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,067
-You put them in there?
-No, no. It's a long story.

240
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,935
Just try to get it up.

241
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,908
-Bad place to put your keys.
-Yeah, I know that.

242
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,746
-Could you start working?
-Difficult job.

243
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,545
If you want those keys,
we're gonna have to dig this up.

244
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,113
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

245
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,626
-ls this about money?
-Yeah, it's about money.

246
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,479
Excuse me,
what are you doing in there?

247
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,418
Nothing, I was just....

248
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,487
I wasn't in there.

249
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,921
You were hanging around in there,
lazing on the job...

250
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,652
...when you should have been
downstairs in the basement...

251
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,989
...cleaning out those old carpets
and scrap wood.

252
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,826
Right, because...

253
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,328
...I'm the janitor.

254
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,769
-Don't get smart with me.
-Yes, ma'am.

255
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,603
If you're heading north
on the Arthur Berkhardt...

256
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,212
...whoa, Nellie. For some reason...

257
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,905
...four lanes are converging into two
instantaneously...

258
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,675
...right at mile marker 1 1 4.

259
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,911
I don't know what that is, but
the A.B.E. 's a parking lot out there.

260
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,716
Somebody screwed up on that one.

261
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,358
-Oh, it's you.
-ls the flounder here yet?

262
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,058
No, it's not here yet.
You want the tour?

263
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,071
There's this.

264
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,578
Nice. French doors would
really open this place up.

265
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,182
Oh, but you have a slop bucket.

266
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,978
The fish.

267
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,988
-What are you doing here?
-Hey.

268
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,149
-Hey.
-Oh, I was--

269
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,386
I was waiting downstairs
for the jackhammer.

270
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,259
-I just thought I'd drop by.
-Kramer's guys?

271
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,956
Yeah. I got them down to 50 bucks.

272
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,068
I just have to do
all the jackhammering.

273
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,637
Oh, that's nice, kind of
a hard-labor fantasy camp.

274
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,712
Oh, yeah.

275
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,610
Oh, sweet setup.

276
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,413
Look, Elaine, do you have any
paint thinner? I need like 40 gallons.

277
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,680
-I'm plumb out.
-Oh, damn.

278
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,554
If I don't get that black paint off,
the city's gonna go ape.

279
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,287
I don't wanna lose my baby.

280
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,929
-Janitor.
-It's Mrs. Allister.

281
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,897
Yeah. Yes, coming, Mrs. Allister.
Okay, I've gotta get out.

282
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,028
Let's go. Let's go. Here. Can you--?
You gotta move from the door.

283
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,544
Hi.

284
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,605
I-- What can I do for you?

285
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,583
I told you yesterday to haul that trash
out of the basement.

286
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,118
Yeah, I am so sorry.

287
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,415
Some of the children
have been playing near it...

288
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,057
...and putting it in their mouth.

289
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,053
Well, a lot of it is vegetables.

290
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,896
You mop it.

291
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,771
Get that stuff out of there today,
or you'll be out of here, understand?

292
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,836
-Yes, ma'am.
-Stop pushing.

293
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,571
-Kramer spilled ammonia.
-I don't feel like eating.

294
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,181
I'm gonna borrow this, huh?

295
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,449
Janitors' meeting.

296
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,519
So, Jerry, why'd you call me?

297
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,819
Well, I thought it's about time
we put aside all this silliness.

298
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,725
I know now that you didn't put
anything in my toilet bowl.

299
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,662
-Did you?
-Yes, I did.

300
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,360
Well, whatever.
So how have you been?

301
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,528
-Good.
-Good.

302
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,732
Steak knife?

303
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,377
-It's just eating away at you, isn't it?
-No.

304
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,774
-Hi.
-Hi.

305
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,007
-Hi.
-Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?

306
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,411
For what?

307
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,678
I have to haul some dirty garbage
to the dump.

308
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,880
Dirt? That's all right, because
there's nothing wrong with dirt.

309
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,786
Well, actually, it's pretty grimy.

310
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,019
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze,
whatever it is...

311
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:55,189
...you take that stuff and put it
right on my leather upholstery.

312
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,495
Well, I don't know who you are,
but thanks for the car.

313
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,536
-Sure. Bye.
-Bye.

314
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,436
-Bye.
-Bye.

315
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,937
There, you see?
I just lent her my car...

316
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:12,243
...and she's gonna fill it
with all sorts of....

317
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,885
All right! You win.

318
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,385
That car was my last
germfree sanctuary.

319
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,989
I slept there last night.

320
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,218
Now, for the love of God, please,
what is it? What is it?

321
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,123
-Toilet brush.
-Toilet brush.

322
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,696
-All right. I can replace that.
-You wanna order dinner?

323
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,362
Yeah. Let's go to your place.

324
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,939
Because I threw out all my dishes.

325
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,658
That's true.
But I'll tell you this much:

326
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,461
I am never going to let some
silly hygienic mishap...

327
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:08,936
...get in the way of what could be a
meaningful, long-lasting relationship.

328
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,777
Do you hear something?

329
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,780
I don't know what that could be.

330
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,530
Holy cow.

331
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,630
Anyway, I'm a new man...

332
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,068
...and I'm looking towards the future.

333
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,802
Clean, dirty, whatever.

334
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,315
Holy cow.

335
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,649
Have a nice life.

336
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:06,020
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes.

337
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,361
This is so luxurious.

338
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,994
Yeah.

339
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,044
Bugger.

340
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,152
What the hell was that?

341
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,203
Double bugger.

342
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,814
Oh, the humanity!

343
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,218
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing out here?

344
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,229
Man, did you see that fireball?

345
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,129
Hey, I gotta skedaddle.
You want a lift?

346
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,699
Newman?

347
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,371
Newman!

348
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,039
All right, I'll meet you
at the coffee shop.
