1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:07,501
If a friend gets involved in a
relationship, it affects your friendship.

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,734
Because you're like a comedy team,
and now there's this third person.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,174
It kind of throws off the timing:
"Who's on first?"

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,574
"I don't know.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,013
Dear, who do you think
is on first?"

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,552
Whenever a friend starts with
a new girlfriend, he should just say:

7
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,622
"I look like the person
you used to know...

8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,249
...but I've been modified
to survive in this relationship.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,192
In other words, if we're having
an argument and she's there...

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,355
...I may say,
'I totally disagree with you.'

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,557
But what that means is:

12
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,431
'I'd like to help you out, but I'd rather
continue to see her naked."'

13
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,545
Okay, cowboys, what will you have?

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,376
I'll have the turkey club
without the bacon.

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,982
And I'll have the bacon club
without the turkey.

16
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,983
George, don't make me
get tough with you.

17
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,314
Why? You think you can
beat me up?

18
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,984
You wouldn't want me to mess up
that beautiful face of yours.

19
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,461
Stop it. Stop it.

20
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,764
You don't want bacon.
I'll surprise you.

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,131
- Is she not terrific?
- She does have a way.

22
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,741
You think she thinks
I have a beautiful face?

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,470
Well, they do work on tips.

24
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,046
"George, don't make me
get tough with you."

25
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,813
Who says that? She is really cool.

26
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,851
What do you think?
You think she likes me?

27
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,183
I should've got the egg-white omelet.

28
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,426
Why should she like me? Who am I?
There's a million people to like.

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,587
The omelet. Damn.

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,325
Maybe she could like me.
Is it that far-fetched?

31
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,197
Maybe she sees something.
Is it possible?

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,430
- No. Not possible.
- No. Not possible.

33
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,405
- Hey.
- Hey, Laney.

34
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,375
- How was the trip?
- What trip? You were gone?

35
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,741
I went to England.

36
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,681
With Mr. Pitt, for five days?

37
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,112
- How was it?
- Actually, it was great.

38
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,781
I met an Englishman,
and we really hit it off.

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,958
Well, that relationship has
obviously got a lot of potential.

40
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,427
Yeah, well, Jerome...

41
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,432
...I happen to be flying him in
on my frequent-flier miles.

42
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,537
Flying him in?
How long is he staying for?

43
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,334
It's an open-ended ticket.
He can return anytime he wants.

44
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,534
All this in five days.

45
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,804
Oh, no. It's Kenny Bania.

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,847
- Who's he?
- He's this awful comedian.

47
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,143
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Kenny.

48
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,520
- Elaine, George.
- Hi.

49
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,824
- How's it going?
- Great. I've been working out.

50
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,926
Went from a size 40 to a 42.

51
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,923
- No kidding?
- Yeah. I'm huge.

52
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,993
- Well, I'll leave you guys alone.
- Okay, thanks.

53
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,269
Oh, Jerry, you know
what just hit me? I was thinking...

54
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,168
- What size suit are you?
- I'm a 40. Why?

55
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,708
I just got a brand-new Armani suit,
doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?

56
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,503
Well, I don't know if...

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,580
Oh, come on.
Why should it sit in a closet?

58
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,185
- An Armani suit?
- Take the suit.

59
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,283
Well, okay, I guess.

60
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,356
- You gonna be home later?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,686
I'll drop it off.

62
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:19,354
- Hey, new suit!
- Yeah, yeah. Lucky me.

63
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,530
Here, I personally made you
a cold chicken sandwich.

64
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,033
It's not even on the menu.

65
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,733
Oh, this is fabulous.

66
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,133
Boy, she is nice.

67
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,870
I like her. I like her, Jerry.
She's got substance.

68
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,911
She oozes substance.

69
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,641
Well, go in there and talk to her.

70
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,081
She's not gonna put them
on the glass.

71
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,281
You mean the walk back in?

72
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,583
That's the toughest move
in the business.

73
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,720
You're sending me
into no mars land...

74
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,158
...and if I get shot down,
I have to crawl back.

75
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,896
Well, I can't do it, I tell you!

76
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,466
Pull yourself together.
You're going in there, soldier.

77
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,364
That's an order!

78
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,232
Get in there.

79
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,602
- Hey.
- Hey.

80
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,337
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

81
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,573
- What?
- Help me move my refrigerator.

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,581
- Why?
- Because I'm getting rid of it.

83
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,988
- Yeah?
- It's K.B. I have the suit.

84
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,251
All right, come on up.

85
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,759
- So...
- Why get rid of your refrigerator?

86
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,262
After that kidney stone,
I only want fresh food.

87
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,425
It's gotta be fresh.
I'm not eating any more stored food.

88
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,264
Plus, you know, I want the space.

89
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,839
- What for?
- Well, I could put a dresser in there.

90
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,978
I could get dressed
while I'm making breakfast.

91
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,436
Hey!

92
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,413
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,108
Didrt think I was really gonna
give you a suit, did you?

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,982
- You're giving him this suit?
- That's right. And it's Armani.

95
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,713
Armani?

96
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,451
- Hey, Armani, Jerry.
- Yes, yes, I heard.

97
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,595
- Come on, try it on.
- No, it's okay.

98
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,231
- Come on. I want to see how it fits.
- All right.

99
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,731
- There you go.
- There, okay?

100
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,960
Oh, boy. Look at that.
That looks great.

101
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,633
- I can't believe you're giving him this.
- And I don't even want anything for it.

102
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,472
- He's very generous, isn't he?
- Yes. Yes, he is.

103
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,509
I'll tell you what, you can take me
out to dinner sometime.

104
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,511
- Dinner?
- Yeah, you buy me a meal.

105
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,715
- Can't get a better deal than that.
- You'll never get a better deal.

106
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,417
- All right, I'll leave you alone.
- Yeah, yeah.

107
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,653
Look at that. Armani. Yeah.

108
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,390
Yeah, that's a deal.
That's a terrible deal.

109
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,730
I don't want to go out to dinner
with him. I'd rather make my own suit.

110
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,169
- I did it. It's all done.
- Hey.

111
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,774
I did it. We're going out
as soon as she gets off work.

112
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,204
And it'll still be daytime.

113
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,039
I'm better in the daytime than at night.
It's less pressure.

114
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,737
I love the day date.

115
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,883
- No wine, no shower.
- There you go.

116
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,446
- So the trip was good?
- Yes.

117
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,748
Apart from that dreadful airline food.

118
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,222
Wreaked absolute havoc
with my stomach.

119
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,190
You know, I have to say,
I've never admitted this to anyone...

120
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,198
...but I kind of like airline food.

121
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,068
That's probably because of...

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,003
What?

123
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,542
- What?
- Yeah, what?

124
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,240
What?

125
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,612
Where I come from,
we don't say "what."

126
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,311
It's proper to say "pardon."

127
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,122
Oh, this should be interesting.

128
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,159
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

129
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,999
So then, about a year ago, I started
selling these funky little hair clips.

130
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,934
It's going pretty good.
I make them in my apartment.

131
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:49,370
I'm just waitressing because I wanted
to go to Europe this summer...

132
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,908
...and I could use a few extra...
Careful.

133
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,139
Oh, it's just horse manure.
Horse manure's not that bad.

134
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,579
I don't even mind
the word "manure."

135
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,776
You know, it's "nure,"
which is good...

136
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,979
...and a "ma" in front of it.
Manure.

137
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,651
When you consider the other choices,
"manure" is actually pretty refreshing.

138
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,457
- That's a nice watch, George.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,226
You know, my boyfriend
has the same one.

140
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,827
- Really?
- Yeah, he loves watches.

141
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,735
- He's a real watch freak.
- Well, how about that?

142
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,935
- Oh, look out. You stepped right in it.
- Yes. I sure did.

143
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,449
So you just pretended
it didn't bother you?

144
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,948
What is that? Boyfriend?
I don't understand that.

145
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,883
What does she think
I asked her out for?

146
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,115
It's the way they just slip it
in there too.

147
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,261
Yeah, like it's all just part
of the conversation.

148
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,761
"My boyfriend really likes watches.
He's a real watch freak."

149
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,333
Well, that's fabulous.

150
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,028
Well, let me ask you this. What exactly
did you say when you asked her out?

151
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,103
I said, "Would you like
to go for a walk or something?"

152
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:02,373
- Oh, a walk? Well...
- Or something. I said "or something."

153
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,147
Or something?

154
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,650
- Yeah, that's a date.
- There you go.

155
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,653
Of course, there is always the
possibility that she called an audible.

156
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,258
- What do you mean?
- She got to the line of scrimmage...

157
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,555
...didn't like the looks of the defense
and changed the play.

158
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,763
I think things were going okay.
We were having a nice conversation.

159
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,428
I mentioned how I liked
horse manure.

160
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,936
- You did?
- Yeah.

161
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,005
- You said you liked horse manure?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,811
You know, about how, when you break
it down, it's really a very positive thing.

163
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,582
You know, you have a "nure"
with a "ma" in front of it.

164
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,591
Manure. It's not bad.

165
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,620
And it was around this point
she mentioned the boyfriend?

166
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,264
Yeah.

167
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,662
Oh, you think because
of what I said about the manure?

168
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,033
I was just saying how
it takes a negative thing...

169
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,731
...and puts a positive spin on it.

170
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,037
I'm just saying there's a chance
she may not have been enamored...

171
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,375
...with your thoughts and feelings
on manure.

172
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,873
So you don't think
she really has a boyfriend.

173
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,985
My honest opinion?
I think she made it up.

174
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,254
Well, then she's just a liar,
isn't she?

175
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,753
Hey.

176
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,256
You want something to eat,
don't you?

177
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,589
Oh, no, no, no.
You got me all wrong, buddy.

178
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,530
I am loving this no refrigerator.
You know what I discovered?

179
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:33,934
I really like depriving myself of things.
It's fun. Very monastic.

180
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,241
- Well, what do you eat?
- It's all fresh.

181
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:41,346
Fresh fish, fresh fowl, fresh fruit.
I buy it. I eat it.

182
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,648
- Well, I'm glad it's working out.
- Oh, yeah. It's working out.

183
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,752
And I got a date with that waitress
who works at Reggie's.

184
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,678
Boy, if I could meet a hostess,
we could open up our own place.

185
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,160
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you,
she's a full-figured gal.

186
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,425
- Is she?
- Oh, you better believe it, buddy.

187
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,927
- George, we could double sometime.
- Yeah, yeah, we could.

188
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,763
You know, Kramer,
the next time you talk to her...

189
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,098
...find out if she knows Kelly
from Monk's.

190
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,264
I want to know
if she really has a boyfriend.

191
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,501
All right, let's get over here.

192
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,702
- Hello.
- Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.

193
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,871
- Oh, hi.
- I was thinking, if you're not busy...

194
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,108
...maybe I can get my meal today?

195
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,159
Yeah, you want to get that meal,
don't you?

196
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,297
How about Mendy's.
Ever been there?

197
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,231
- No, I haven't.
- You're gonna love it.

198
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,735
- I'll meet you there around 7.
- All right.

199
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,670
Yeah, I really needed that suit.

200
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,741
I start off with curls.
That's good for the bicep.

201
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,143
I do 10 reps, two sets.

202
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,741
That's fantastic.

203
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,510
- You work out with weights?
- I don't.

204
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,917
- You should.
- Why?

205
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,095
- You worn the suit yet?
- No, not yet.

206
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,562
- Have you decided?
- Oh, get the swordfish.

207
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,759
Best swordfish in the city.
The best, Jerry.

208
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,097
I'll have the salmon.

209
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,428
And you?

210
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,508
You know what I think?
I'm just gonna have soup.

211
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,510
Yeah, I'll save the meal
for another time.

212
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,010
Another time? What other time?

213
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,122
I had a hot dog earlier.
I'm not that hungry.

214
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,554
No, no, Bania, no.

215
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,087
This is the dinner.
The soup counts.

216
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,202
Soup's not a meal.
You're supposed to buy me a meal.

217
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,431
I'm not stopping you from eating.
Go ahead. Get anything you want.

218
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,407
- But I don't want anything but soup.
- Then that's the meal.

219
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,368
But I had the hot dog.

220
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,742
Who told you to have a hot dog?

221
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,044
Hey, I give you
a brand-new Armani suit...

222
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,914
...and you won't even
buy me a meal.

223
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,820
All right, fine. Get the soup.

224
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,064
So he just gets soup.
He wants to save the meal.

225
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,928
So now I got to do it
all over again.

226
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,093
What kind of soup did he get?

227
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,004
I don't know.
Consomme or something.

228
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,573
- Consomme.
- What?

229
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,938
Well, that's really not a meal, Jerry.

230
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,604
I mean, if he had gotten
chicken gumbo or matzo ball...

231
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,114
...even mushroom barley,
then I would agree with you.

232
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,149
Those are very hearty soups.

233
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,845
- You're missing the whole point.
- What?

234
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,115
The meal is the act
of sitting down with him.

235
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,724
It doesn't matter what you get.

236
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,953
As long as he's sitting
in that restaurant, it's a meal.

237
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,963
- Was it a cup or a bowl?
- You see? Again.

238
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,102
- I'm just curious.
- A bowl, okay?

239
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,260
Did he crumble any crackers in it?

240
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,105
Did he crumble any crackers in it?

241
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,004
As a matter of fact, he did.

242
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:03,581
Oh, well, crackers in a bowl.
That could be a meal.

243
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,149
It's like I'm talking
to my aunt Sylvia here.

244
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,081
- Hi, Simon. This is Jerry.
- Hello.

245
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,284
- Elaine, do you have cash on you?
- Yeah, in my purse.

246
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,452
No, there was only $6.

247
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,699
Well, I have some money.
What do you need?

248
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,461
Twenty should cover me.
Thanks, mate.

249
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,164
- Where are you going?
- Just visiting.

250
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,867
- Okay. See you later.
- I won't be back for dinner.

251
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,403
Pardon?

252
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,311
- So is she working? Is she here?
- Yeah, yeah, she's here.

253
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,819
- Have you said anything?
- No. I'm very uncomfortable.

254
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,514
- Are you gonna say anything?
- I don't know. I don't know.

255
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,159
- Hello.
- Hello.

256
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,557
Well, what's it going to be?

257
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,232
- "What's it gonna be?"
- Yes. What will you have?

258
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,199
Are you eating?
It's in that vein.

259
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,298
- I'll just have a bowl of chili.
- I'll have an egg-white omelet.

260
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,877
- "What's it gonna be?" Hear that?
- Yeah, that was bad.

261
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,275
Did you feel that tension?

262
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,848
We used to have banter.
There's no more banter.

263
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,147
Oh, no. It's Kenny.
Slide out so he can't sit here.

264
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,485
- Hey.
- Hey.

265
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,289
- You worn the suit yet?
- Actually I did.

266
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,953
I put it on last night
and slept in it.

267
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,567
- You did?
- No, I'm joking.

268
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,765
Can I squeeze in?

269
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,841
Sure you can.

270
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,575
Thanks.

271
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,377
- Can I take your order?
- What kind of soup do you have?

272
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,884
Why don't you get a sandwich.

273
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,421
Okay. I'll have tomato soup
and tuna on toast.

274
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:56,152
Okay. This is it, you know.

275
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,589
This is the meal.
So stock up, buddy boy.

276
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,597
What are you talking about?
This isn't a meal.

277
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,332
Yes, it is. Soup and sandwich.
That is a meal.

278
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,608
You're supposed to buy me dinner
in a nice restaurant like Mendy's.

279
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,078
- I tried to do that.
- This is lunch in a coffee shop.

280
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,184
It doesn't matter. This is it.
This completes the transaction.

281
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,281
Oh, soup and a sandwich
for a brand-new Armani suit.

282
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,653
- Is that any kind of a gesture?
- I'm really not comfortable...

283
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,624
Hey, I just spoke to Hildy
about your friend.

284
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,388
- Yeah?
- She doesn't have a boyfriend.

285
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,929
She made it up.

286
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:45,966
- Hi.
- Hi.

287
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,443
- Where's Simon?
- Oh, he'll be right up.

288
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,208
He's just getting some beer.

289
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:55,046
And I'm not expecting any change.

290
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,989
- Whers he leaving?
- About two days.

291
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,921
Although he's hinting
at how he'd like to stay.

292
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,893
Fortunately, he has no money
and no prospects.

293
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,828
- Hey, mate. Fancy a beer?
- No, thanks.

294
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,429
Hello?

295
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,131
No, I'm sorry, Bania.
I'm not going over this again.

296
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,106
Well, who told you to order soup?

297
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,408
No, there's no dinner.
There's not going to be any dinner.

298
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,780
You've had a sandwich
and two bowls of soup, and that's it.

299
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,282
Goodbye.

300
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,717
- Hey, what size suit are you?
- Forty.

301
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,884
Forty. Perfect.

302
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,895
- Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
- Absolutely.

303
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,829
Great. It's yours.
I can't stand the sight of it.

304
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,197
- Elaine, here's the car keys.
- Thanks.

305
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,206
- Yep.
- Listen, Jerry.

306
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,366
I been doing some thinking.
I want my suit back.

307
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,443
I don't have your suit.
I gave it away.

308
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,343
- Well, it's my suit.
- Well, it's gone.

309
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,882
I'm sorry. Goodbye, Bania.

310
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

311
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,648
Yeah.

312
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,091
- Well, how's everything?
- Okay.

313
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,658
Good.

314
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,159
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

315
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,230
Really?

316
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,127
You want food, don't you?

317
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,869
It's not for me, it's for Hildy,
the waitress I was telling you about.

318
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,904
She's hungry. She wants food.

319
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,976
If I go back in there without any food,
there's gonna be trouble.

320
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,774
All right, go ahead.

321
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,581
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

322
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,585
There's a few things in here.
Peanut butter, cheese. Yeah.

323
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,589
- Cheese is good. What kind?
- Swiss.

324
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,728
All right, it'll have to do. Come on.

325
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,461
What are you doing out here?

326
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,759
I can't go in there.
I'm too uncomfortable.

327
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,629
So we're not gonna go
in there anymore?

328
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,470
Hey, what are you doing out here?

329
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,472
We can't eat here anymore,
because he took a waitress for a walk.

330
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,475
What's the difference?
Let's go to Reggie's.

331
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,172
- Reggie's? I can't eat anything there.
- It's the same menu.

332
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,407
There's no big salad.

333
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,784
They'll make you a big salad.

334
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,286
What do you think, they're
the only ones that make a big salad?

335
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,415
All right, let's go to Reggie's.

336
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,189
So, what's going on with Simon?
Did he leave?

337
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,832
Wait till you hear this.

338
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,764
So Simon picks this woman up
right in front of me.

339
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,337
Look at this. They make a point
of saying on the menu:

340
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,701
"No egg-white omelets."
Look at that.

341
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,311
So what? Have a yolk.
It won't kill you.

342
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,606
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Hildy.

343
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,544
Could I get an egg-white omelet?

344
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,880
- Did you read the menu?
- All right. Just give me a western.

345
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,987
- How about a big salad?
- A big salad?

346
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,755
- You see?
- Just tell her what you want.

347
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,087
They'll make it for you.

348
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,897
It's a salad, only bigger,
with lots of stuff in it.

349
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,730
I can bring you two small salads.

350
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,197
Could you put it in a big bowl?

351
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,466
We don't have big bowls.

352
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,134
- All right, just give me a cup of decaf.
- We have Sanka.

353
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,778
I mean, it's not fair.
I've been going there for seven years.

354
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,919
- She's been there three weeks.
- Not fair.

355
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,817
If anyone should be forced to leave,
it should be her.

356
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,753
She's on your turf.

357
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,520
If only she could get fired.
Is there any way that could happen?

358
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,220
I mean, I know how
to get myself fired.

359
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,260
- You're the best.
- Well...

360
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,925
How do I get someone else fired?

361
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,093
Well, as I see it...

362
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,105
...you've got to apply the same
principles that get you fired...

363
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,506
...but redirected outwardly.

364
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,337
- Hey.
- Hey.

365
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,537
She's hungry, Jerry.

366
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,705
Well, there's nothing left.
There's no food.

367
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,907
No food?

368
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:50,214
Well, you gotta have something.
I can't go back in there with no food.

369
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,913
She expecting something, Jerry.

370
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,652
You don't know what she's like
when that blood sugar drops.

371
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,062
There, you see, she's already
in a bad mood. She just got fired.

372
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,424
Why did she get fired?

373
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,726
Because I called over there
a couple of times...

374
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,766
...and the manager didn't like it.

375
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,601
Simon is definitely going back now.

376
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,212
He's meeting me here
to return my keys.

377
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,746
Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?

378
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,551
Yes, he's one of those bounders.

379
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,653
- Egg-white omelet, big salad.
- Thank you.

380
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,224
I wanted you guys to know
that Friday is my last day.

381
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,418
Bloomingdale's ordered
a bunch of my clips.

382
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,461
Thank God. I don't have
to do this anymore.

383
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,362
Hey, Jerry. Where's my suit?

384
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,837
I don't have it.
You want half my omelet?

385
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,499
I told you, she's busy.

386
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,703
She can't come to the phone now.

387
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,646
Tell your boyfriend
to stop calling here.

388
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,842
He's not my boyfriend.

389
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,113
It's that bald guy with the glasses
who's always here with them.

390
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,655
He's trying to get me in trouble.

391
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,323
Hey! Yeah.

392
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,863
I got a message for you.

393
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,929
You tell your friend George...

394
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,400
...that the next time
I see him around here...

395
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,940
...I'm gonna turn him into my own
personal hand puppet.

396
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,736
Well, hello.
Here you are, as promised.

397
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,710
You see, I'm a man of my word.

398
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,683
- When are you leaving?
- Are you trying to get rid of me?

399
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,278
I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but
I've been set up with a job interview...

400
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,119
...that might enable me to extend
my visit indefinitely.

401
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,956
And it is all due to this suit.

402
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,228
How do I look?

403
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,335
I'm a shoo-in, aren't I?
Thanks again, hon.

404
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,464
Hey, Kenny. You still
wanna get that suit back?

405
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,664
- Yeah.
- There it goes.

406
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,776
Hey! Hey!

407
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,774
Come here, you.

408
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,676
- Wait, what are you...? Unand me!
- Take it off!
