1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,331
If big man wants
a new scoreboard...

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,499
...I don't wanna be the one
to tell him no.

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,339
No one in the park is gonna be able
to see it from there.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,381
Well, why don't we just
put a monitor in the skybox?

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,576
Hey, George...

6
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,551
...the ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,569
"The ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp."

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,567
You got your shrimp.

9
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:44,841
Oh, yes.
That's what I should have said.

10
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,638
Damn it!

11
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,548
"The ocean called,
they're running out of shrimp"?

12
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,618
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but then I said to him:

13
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,316
"Oh, yeah? Well, the jerk store called,
and they're running out of you."

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,626
Really? That's great.
You said that to him?

15
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,993
Well, actually, I thought it up
on the way over here.

16
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,225
Oh, that's not quite the same.

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,392
No, no, it's not.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,472
You don't know this guy.
It would have been so sweet.

19
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,007
-I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
-All right.

20
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,408
Hello. My name is Milos.
How can I help you?

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,672
I need a can of balls.

22
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,340
A can of balls for the nice guy.

23
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,653
You don't plan to hit these balls
with that racket, do you?

24
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,295
Checking out the staff picks,
Miss Benes?

25
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,453
Oh, hey.

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,692
This Vincent guy,
he is the best.

27
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,665
He and I have
the same taste in movies.

28
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,465
Well, Vincent is an art-house goon.

29
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,300
I stick to the Gene rack.

30
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:53,105
Gene? Oh, he's so stupid
and mainstream.

31
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,043
I've seen all of these,
so I went with the Kramer pick.

32
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,276
The Other Side of Darkness.
I never heard of that one.

33
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,682
Yeah, it went straight to video.

34
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,152
That makes me the premiere.

35
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,363
Jerry? Have you ever seen the movie
The Other Side of Darkness?

36
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,864
-No.
-It's about this woman in a coma.

37
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,903
Well, I couldn't finish watching it,
so I want you to read this.

38
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,972
"l, Cosmo Kramer...

39
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,441
...having just seen the movie
The Other Side of Darkness...

40
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:29,844
...and not wanting to be in a coma
like that lady in the movie...

41
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,917
...hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to
remove my life support...

42
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:38,581
...feeding machine, lung blower,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."

43
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,692
-Can you do that for me?
-I don't know if...

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,727
...what you have here constitutes
a legally binding document.

45
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,592
Well, I'm gonna type it up.

46
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,930
Yes, of course, but even so,
you may wanna talk to a lawyer.

47
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,329
Yeah, well, Jackie Chiles,
he put a restraining order on me.

48
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,167
I'm not allowed within 200 feet
of his office.

49
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,502
I couldn't even give him
his Christmas present.

50
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,144
Oh, hey, new racket, huh?

51
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,908
Yeah, I wasn't gonna get it, but this
guy, Milos, who runs the pro shop...

52
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,311
...he really recommended it.

53
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,919
In fact, it's the only racket
he plays with.

54
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,453
You're not gonna need
this anymore.

55
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,485
Hey, this is the Z page
of my address book.

56
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,687
Oh, yeah, I put all your Z's on
the weights-and-measures page.

57
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:31,744
Bravo, Vincent. Bravo.

58
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,147
-What?
-Did you enjoy the movie?

59
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,655
Who is this?

60
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,022
It's Vincent.

61
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,989
Of Vincent's picks?

62
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,923
The same.

63
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,995
He called you?

64
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,065
Must have got my number
off the computer.

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,137
We ended up talking
for like two hours.

66
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,239
To a guy you've never met?

67
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,137
Your screening process is getting
ever more rigorous.

68
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,772
I'm trying to meet him.
He's never at the video store.

69
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,847
They said he sets his own hours.

70
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,880
-Little help! Hey.
-Here.

71
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,884
Thank you.

72
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,122
Oh, my God, that guy is terrible.

73
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,686
Hey, how come we played at this
crummy place instead of your club?

74
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,093
George used up
all my guest passes already.

75
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,162
-Come on.
-Thank you.

76
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,464
Here you go.

77
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,336
Milos?

78
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,270
Oh, hey. How you doing?

79
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:48,813
Okay. We should wrap it up here.

80
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,725
So he's bad. What do you care?

81
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,590
Elaine, I paid $200 for this racket...

82
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,699
...because he said
it's the only one he plays with.

83
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,858
He could have played just as well
with a log.

84
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,108
Hey. All right, I talked to
this lawyer guy, Shellbach.

85
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,301
He's gonna set me up, but you gotta
come with me to be the executor.

86
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,968
The executor of what?

87
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,513
Kramer wants to die with dignity.

88
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,874
There's a feather in your cap.

89
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,515
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine.
I just want out.

90
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:29,723
Sometimes in life,
the gods smile upon you, my friends.

91
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,665
Did you get someone to take
that Canadian quarter?

92
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,193
I got another meeting with Reilly...

93
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,238
...a whole new audience, and I bet
I can get him to try that line again.

94
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,669
Who's Reilly?

95
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,606
George was scarfing shrimp
at this meeting, and this guy says:

96
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,610
"Hey, George, the ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp."

97
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,112
Listen to the comeback:

98
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,919
"Oh, yeah? Well, the jerk store called.
They're running out of you."

99
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,558
What? You gotta be kidding me.

100
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,495
How about this one? How about:

101
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:12,161
"Your cranium called.
It's got some space to rent."

102
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,031
-What does that mean?
-Hey, here you go:

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,803
"Hey, Reilly, the zoo called.
You're due back by 6."

104
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,209
No, no, no, you're not helping me.

105
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,876
Look, just tell him you had sex
with his wife. That'll get him.

106
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,322
I'm not looking for another line.
I got the line.

107
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,458
Look, George, just think about it,
you know?

108
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,025
You're married, how would you feel
if somebody says...

109
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,718
-...they just had sex--
-You see?

110
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,989
This is why I hate writing
with a large group.

111
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,998
Everybody has their own opinions,
and it all gets homogenized...

112
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,863
...and you lose the whole edge of it.

113
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:48,336
I'm going with "jerk store."
"Jerk store" is the line.

114
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,277
Jerk store. Yes.

115
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,686
Did you take this out of
the garbage?

116
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,619
It's still got spring in the strings.

117
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,283
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk.

118
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,827
How are you gonna be
the executor of my living will?

119
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,659
You see, you can't let go.

120
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:20,563
Trust me, Kramer, given the
legal opportunity, I will kill you.

121
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,933
I wish I could believe you.

122
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,140
Hey, Elaine, do you have
some free time tomorrow afternoon?

123
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,143
-Me?
-Yeah, because you're perfect.

124
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,509
You're a calculating,
cold-hearted business woman.

125
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,210
When there's dirty work to be done,
you don't mind stomping on throats.

126
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,947
Oh, come on.

127
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,055
Situation number four:
You're breathing on your own...

128
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,391
...you're conscious,
but with no muscular function.

129
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,697
Well, would I be able to
communicate?

130
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,801
I don't see how.

131
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,567
I don't like the sound of this one.

132
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,003
Yeah, let's pull the cord, huh?

133
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,906
Yank it like you're starting a mower.

134
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,240
Moving on.

135
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,577
You have liver, kidneys
and gallbladder...

136
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,879
...but no central nervous system.

137
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,888
Well, I gotta have
a central nervous system.

138
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:21,566
Okay. One lung, blind,
and you're eating through a tube.

139
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,528
No, that's not my style.

140
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,104
Boring.

141
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,600
All right. You can eat,
but machines do everything else.

142
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,576
I'd stick.

143
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,246
Yeah, yeah, stick, because
I could still go to the coffee shop.

144
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,910
That's right.

145
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,483
-Hello, Milos.
-Jerry.

146
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,025
Thank God you got my message.

147
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,187
Thank you so much
for coming down here. Listen--

148
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,957
You know, I spent $200
on a racket...

149
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,328
...I thought you knew
what you were talking about.

150
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,969
You can't even play.

151
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,264
Believe me,
it is Milos' great shame...

152
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,773
...but, Jerry, I could lose my business
if anybody find out.

153
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,436
How would you like extra year
membership on the club?

154
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,412
-Free, no charge.
-You could do that?

155
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,985
Jerry, for you, anything.

156
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,455
Game, set and match, huh, Milos?

157
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,089
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

158
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,360
They tell me there is no way
they can do it.

159
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:34,131
Is there anything else I could
do for you? Anything at all?

160
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,604
I refund your money.

161
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,640
Milos, I don't even care
about the money.

162
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,404
I just feel like I was taken
by the worst tennis player--

163
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,642
I make it up to you.

164
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,148
Yeah, you make it up to me.

165
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,953
Tennis, anyone?

166
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,424
Oh, this is the one
Vincent told me about.

167
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,431
The Pain and the Yearning.

168
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,564
"An old woman experiences
pain and yearning."

169
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,402
A hundred and ninety-two minutes?

170
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,067
That's a lot of yearning, huh?

171
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,436
You know, these movies are great...

172
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,549
...but they are just
so emotionally exhausting.

173
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,084
Well, what you need is some
summertime adolescent high jinks.

174
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,053
-Really?
-Let's see what Dr. Gene prescribes.

175
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:30,355
Oh, here. Weekend at Bernie's II.
Now, that's an hilarious premise.

176
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,758
-Well--
-Yeah, get it.

177
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,560
-Yeah, I could use a chuckle.
-Yeah.

178
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,367
-What are you getting?
-Nothing.

179
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,004
I'm gonna finish watching
The Other Side of Darkness.

180
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,732
-How much you got left?
-About two hours.

181
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,809
Yeah, she shot in that coma
pretty quick.

182
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,083
Bernie is dead, you morons.

183
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,948
Just because he's wearing
sunglasses, he looks alive?

184
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,023
How long is this weekend, anyway?

185
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,122
-Hello?
-How's the movie, Elaine?

186
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,933
-Vincent?
-A Gene pick.

187
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:14,061
How could you?
I thought we had something special.

188
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,868
No, it doesn't mean anything.

189
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,035
I'm not even gonna rewind it.

190
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,904
Vincent?

191
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,981
All right. Let's get to it.

192
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,847
Wait a minute.
What about Reilly?

193
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,420
Reilly doesn't work here anymore.

194
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,456
What? I didn't hear about that.

195
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,288
We only wake you up
for the important meetings.

196
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,065
-Hello.
-Hello.

197
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,228
Didn't I see you at
the pro shop yesterday?

198
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,773
I think so. I'm Patty.
Milos gave me your address.

199
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,934
I hope you don't mind me
waiting for you here.

200
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,609
Oh, that Milos.

201
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,410
Well, what should we do?
Care for a cup of coffee?

202
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,985
Why don't we just go up to
your apartment?

203
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,954
All right.

204
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,961
Gotta be an easier way.

205
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,722
Doctor, how's her coma?

206
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,627
Oh, exactly the same.

207
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,994
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,363
She's coming out of the coma.

209
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,968
Mrs. Albright, can you hear me?
Are you okay?

210
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,579
I feel so rested and refreshed.

211
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,612
Get me a toothbrush.

212
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,519
So you play tennis?

213
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,245
Enough talk, Jerry.

214
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,685
Not for me. I love chatting.

215
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,023
No, no, I can't do this.

216
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,823
I can't go through with this,
not even for him.

217
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:51,129
-Who?
-Milos, my husband.

218
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,668
Your husband?

219
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:07,279
And so concerned was he that word of
his poor tennis skills might leak out...

220
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:13,790
...he chose to offer you his wife as
some sort of medieval sexual payola.

221
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,492
He's new around here.

222
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,564
So details.

223
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,360
Well, I didn't sleep with her.

224
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,293
Because of society, right?

225
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,497
Yes, George, because of society.

226
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,799
So how did the big meeting
turn out?

227
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,479
Reilly is no longer with the club.
Can you believe that?

228
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,638
You're better off.
Now you can just let it go.

229
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,249
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna let it go.

230
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,408
You never had
the right comeback, anyway.

231
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,643
Are you insane?

232
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,313
"Jerk store" would have
smoked that guy.

233
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,189
Smoked him, I say.

234
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,327
Oh, Jerry, listen.

235
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,627
I saw the rest of that movie,
The Other Side of Darkness.

236
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,825
The coma lady wakes up at the end.

237
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,730
Oh, I wanted to see that.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

238
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,371
I didn't know it was possible
to come out of a coma.

239
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,014
I didn't know it was possible
not to know that.

240
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,377
How was Eric Roberts
as the husband?

241
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,178
Oh, unforgettable.

242
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,449
I gotta find Elaine.
You know, she's gonna pull my plug.

243
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,090
What? "Betrayed"?

244
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,363
Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry.

245
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,732
Hey, hey, listen, Elaine, I changed
my mind about the whole coma thing.

246
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,372
Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.

247
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,202
Kramer, do you have any idea
what you've done?

248
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,241
Excuse me.

249
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,410
What are you doing?

250
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,080
Vincent stopped making picks.

251
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,813
Well, how am I gonna know
what movies to see?

252
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,321
We have a wide variety
of Gene picks.

253
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,220
Gene's trash.

254
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,088
I'm Gene.

255
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,631
Hi.

256
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,302
Milos, I can assure you,
I had no intention of telling anyone...

257
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,100
...about your unbelievably bad
tennis playing.

258
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:15,441
Thank you, but unfortunately,
I have much larger problems to fry.

259
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:20,146
My wife, she has no respect
for Milos anymore.

260
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,853
I guess that's a risk you run
when you dabble in the flesh trade.

261
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:28,259
Patty, she-- She loves tennis
as much like I do.

262
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:33,990
Would you--? Will you let me
beat you in tennis?

263
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:38,262
That is the only way I can show her
that I'm still a man.

264
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,735
I'll do it as long as
there's no other girls around.

265
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,466
I mean, I wanna be a man too.

266
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,435
So you hurt Vincent's feelings?

267
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,942
Look what came in the mail today.

268
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,843
What's this?

269
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,913
It's the play button off his VCR.

270
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,354
Boy, look how far back it goes.
It's like a tooth.

271
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,925
So guess where
Mr. Ocean Phone turned up.

272
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,497
He's working for Firestone
in Akron, Ohio.

273
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,133
-Ohio?
-Yup.

274
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,861
I'm leaving first thing
tomorrow morning.

275
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,302
You're flying to Akron
just to zing a guy?

276
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,068
Don't you understand?
It's not about him.

277
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,735
To have a line as perfect as
"jerk store" and to never use it.

278
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,381
I couldn't live with myself.

279
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,280
See, there are no jerk stores.

280
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,415
It's just a little confusing, is all.

281
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,958
It's smart. It's a smart line,
and a smart crowd will appreciate it.

282
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,893
And I'm not gonna dumb it down
for some bonehead mass audience.

283
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,827
Not you.

284
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,170
Oh, these brittle bones.

285
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,867
How I long to be rid of the pain.

286
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,048
-Hello.
-Elaine, it's Vincent.

287
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:03,348
Vincent. Where are you?
I have to meet you.

288
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,514
No, I can't bear to have
anyone see me.

289
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:11,755
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you
the way everyone else does.

290
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,698
You're strange and beautiful
and sensitive.

291
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,202
-Now, let's have a look at you.
-All right.

292
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,536
But can you bring me a few things
from the store?

293
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,110
I haven't been out in a while.

294
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,951
Well, go around,
you bunch of crazies.

295
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,714
Maniacs are gonna get us all killed.

296
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,152
Hi, can I help you?

297
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,452
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm Cosmo Kramer.

298
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,892
Yeah, I had an appointment
to annul my living will.

299
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,228
Oh, Mr. Kramer, you had
a 1 0:30 appointment. It's 2:00.

300
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,336
Mr. Shellbach had a tennis lesson.
He's gone for the day.

301
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:11,580
-Too good.
-Another game for Milos!

302
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,624
You're on fire today.

303
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,921
Hey, Patty, look at this guy.
He's awful.

304
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,993
He's not a man, this Jerry.

305
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,157
He's not even married like I am.

306
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,162
Hey, Milos, I don't mind
rolling over here...

307
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,330
...but could you lighten up
on the "not a man" stuff?

308
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:34,536
Hey, everybody, look. The little
chicken girl wants me to ease up.

309
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,843
He can't handle this.
He cries like a woman.

310
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,958
Hello? Vincent?

311
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,329
Elaine?

312
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,028
I got what you asked.

313
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,230
Just leave it and go.

314
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,307
Well, can I come in?

315
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,467
No, go away, now.

316
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:11,613
No, no, Vincent, l....
Oh, don't shut me out.

317
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,651
I just-- I know you feel what I feel.

318
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,756
-Excuse me, can I help you?
-Oh, damn it.

319
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,324
-I'm here to see Vincent.
-Well, I'm his mother.

320
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,827
-Vincent, what's going on here?
-No, my acne!

321
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,231
Acne?

322
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,369
What do you have here?

323
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,530
Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks.

324
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,541
What kind of a sick woman
brings this to a 1 5-year-old?

325
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,679
We have the same taste in movies.

326
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,840
Did he send you part of our VCR?

327
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,289
Vincent?

328
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,435
Look at the big baby.

329
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,739
Hey, big baby,
are you wetting yourself?

330
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,712
Maybe it is time for you
to be changed.

331
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,986
I told you to cut it out.

332
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,886
Come on, what are you doing?

333
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,387
The baby got lucky on that one.

334
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,663
Shellbach. Hey.

335
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,114
Racket?

336
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:19,007
So, George, you're proposing
a Snow Tire Day at Yankee Stadium?

337
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,470
As long as they don't
throw them on the field.

338
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,411
Help yourself to some shrimp.
I brought enough for everybody.

339
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,448
I have to say, this--

340
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,779
This proposal doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

341
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,182
Well, you never know.

342
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,687
Let's see how many
I can fit in my mouth.

343
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,623
You know, George...

344
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,563
...the ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp.

345
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,299
Oh, yeah, Reilly?

346
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,636
Well, the jerk store called.
They're running out of you.

347
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:56,236
What's the difference?
You're their all-time bestseller.

348
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:08,156
Yeah? Well, I had sex
with your wife.

349
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,196
His wife's in a coma.

350
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,850
Hi. How's he doing?

351
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,953
He's been sleeping a lot.
He's still groggy.

352
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,317
I thought a movie
might cheer him up.

353
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,119
-I got him a Gene pick.
-What happened to Vincent?

354
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,826
I'm kind of off of him.

355
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,760
Outlet?

356
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,615
"My wife's in a coma."

357
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:20,326
Yeah? Well, the life-support machine
called and.... Stupid.

358
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:27,666
Wait. Yes.
That's what I should have said.

359
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:37,207
You're meat, Reilly!
You just screwed yourself!
