1
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:06,283
The problem with the beginning
of the relationship...

2
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:09,047
...is each person has their
own sexual timetable...

3
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:12,521
...of what should happen when, that
the other person knows nothing about.

4
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:15,958
That's why I think we need
some sort of sexual rule book...

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,154
...where it's written down
and agreed upon...

6
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:21,199
...sexual standard dating procedure.

7
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:23,928
Know what I mean? So if there's
any problems, you can go:

8
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:27,096
"Look, honey, I'm sorry,
but we've been out three times...

9
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:29,640
...and according to Article 7,
Section 5...

10
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:33,677
...there's got to be some physical
contact, as you can see right there.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,780
Otherwise,
I will report you to the board...

12
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,008
...and they can issue a warrant
for an embrace."

13
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:44,854
Wait a second. Wait a second.

14
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,823
Then the butler says,
"I'm not cleaning it up.

15
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:51,123
- I'm sick of cleaning!"
- That's funny. That's funny.

16
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:53,732
"I'm sick of cleaning."
That's very funny.

17
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:55,865
I've never seen a pilot script
this funny.

18
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:58,027
- Yeah, it's funny.
- How funny is this?

19
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:00,605
- It's funny.
- I mean, we're not stupid, right?

20
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:04,107
- We know when something's funny.
- It cannot not be funny.

21
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:06,939
Come on, let's stay with it.
We gotta finish this today.

22
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:09,446
Maybe I should give it
to my therapist to read.

23
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,483
- She's smart. I trust her.
- Maybe I'll give it to Elaine.

24
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:15,812
We haven't brought the Elaine
character into the show yet.

25
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,513
We should get her into this scene.

26
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:20,592
Right. Right. Okay.

27
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:23,389
"Elaine enters."

28
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:24,791
Right.

29
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:26,993
What does she say?

30
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,396
- I don't know. What do women say?
- I don't know.

31
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:36,804
I don't even know what they think.
That's why I'm in therapy.

32
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:40,244
If we bring Elaine in, it'll be
so many people to keep track of.

33
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:42,746
It's too hard. I forget where
everybody is standing.

34
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,941
You, me, Kramer, the butler.
It's too much.

35
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:48,315
- All right, forget Elaine.
- All right.

36
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,052
- Hey.
- Hey.

37
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,457
You are never gonna believe
who I just ran into today.

38
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,963
- Who?
- Your old flame: Gail Cunningham.

39
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,361
Did you talk to her?

40
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,368
Well, I was on my way to the Y,
and I saw her coming towards me.

41
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:05,903
I didn't know what to do.

42
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:08,007
I remember you had
three dates with her...

43
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,040
...and she wouldn't
kiss you good night.

44
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,770
So now I'm thinking,
"What is my duty to my friend?

45
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:15,039
Do I acknowledge her?
Do I ignore her?"

46
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:17,615
- I mean, what is my responsibility?
- So, what happened?

47
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:21,515
You know, she sees me
and she goes, "Hi, Kramer!"

48
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,246
Like nothing happened.

49
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:27,052
Like she never went three dates
with you and refused to kiss you.

50
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:31,493
- Yeah, I know about the three dates.
- You know what I did? I snubbed her.

51
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:36,528
- What do you mean you snubbed her?
- I walked by her, never said a word.

52
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:39,804
- Right by her?
- Right by her.

53
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:43,136
What do you say about a guy
like this, huh?

54
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,747
You are some great friend. I'll tell you.
Snubbed her. Not that I condone it.

55
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,116
I've never condoned snubbing
in my administration.

56
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:54,310
But your loyalty is beyond question.

57
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,615
Well, you know, she's lucky I was
in a good mood.

58
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,257
Could have been a lot worse.

59
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:04,555
- I'm not even in here.
- Yeah, I know.

60
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,529
I thought there was gonna be
a character named "Elaine Benes."

61
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,828
There were too many people
in the room.

62
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,595
We couldn't keep track
of everybody:

63
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,103
George and the butler...

64
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:16,037
You "couldn't keep track
of everybody"?

65
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,042
Well, we tried. We couldn't.
We didn't know how to...

66
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:23,908
We couldn't write for a woman.
We didn't know what you would say.

67
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,546
Even right now,
I know you're gonna say something.

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,312
I have no idea what it is.

69
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,718
You have no idea?

70
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,019
Something derogatory?

71
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:37,493
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Well, Gail Cunningham.

72
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,655
- Hi, Gail.
- Hi, Elaine.

73
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,960
- What is with your friend, Kramer?
- Why?

74
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,363
He snubbed me.

75
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,196
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

76
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,570
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing. Hey, give me that.

77
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:52,906
- I thought you finished.
- I took two bites. How am I finished?

78
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,708
Plus, you're coming down with
something. You want me to get sick?

79
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,178
Bite?

80
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,216
I wanna know.
Why did Kramer do that?

81
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:03,584
I don't know. Once he leaves the
building, he's out of my jurisdiction.

82
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:07,022
- Tell him that I am mad at him.
- All right. So where you cooking now?

83
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,261
- Pfieffer's.
- Oh, the power-lunch crowd.

84
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:11,588
Nice shoes.

85
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,191
- Thank you.
- Where did you get them?

86
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,563
They're Botticelli's.

87
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:22,432
Botticelli's. Look at you.
I'm afraid to go in there.

88
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,099
Really?

89
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:27,413
- Would you care to join us?
- No, no. I gotta get to the restaurant.

90
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,980
- See you.
- See you.

91
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:35,218
"Look at you with your Botticelli's."

92
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:38,413
- That bothered you?
- Yes, it bothered me.

93
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,890
So I bought a pair of shoes
at Botticelli's.

94
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:42,585
I'm not allowed to shop there?

95
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,696
That really embarrassed me.

96
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:48,596
- It did?
- Yes. Couldn't you see that?

97
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:50,997
No.

98
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,366
This is why you're not in the pilot.

99
00:04:57,244 --> 00:05:00,941
Well, George, I think you're beginning
to get some perspective on things.

100
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,741
I think we're making progress.

101
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,181
- Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
- Good. Let's pick up on this next week.

102
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,581
Great.

103
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:13,554
By the way, did you get a chance
to read the script?

104
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,991
Yes. Yes, I did.

105
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,789
Well, what did you think?

106
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,864
It was...

107
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,295
...good.

108
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,631
You didn't like it?

109
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:27,670
Well, no...

110
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,277
I can't believe this. What was wrong
with it? What didn't you like about it?

111
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:32,502
It wasn't funny.

112
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,477
It wasn't funny?
What, are you kidding?

113
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,947
No. I didn't find it funny.

114
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:41,815
You didn't find it funny?
This is what I'm paying for?

115
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:45,617
Well, that whole story line about a guy
who gets into a car accident...

116
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,421
...doesn't have insurance, so the judge
sentences him to be a butler?

117
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:51,120
I didn't really buy that.

118
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:57,237
Let me tell you who did buy it.
We pitched this story...

119
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:02,364
...to Russell Dalrymple, the president
of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.

120
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,476
If you're going to be
in a creative field...

121
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,272
...you're gonna have to learn how
to deal with criticism.

122
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:08,914
How's this for criticism?

123
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,276
You stink.
How do you like that criticism?

124
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,945
You know what's funny to me?
That diploma up on the wall.

125
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:19,887
That is my idea of comedy.

126
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,392
You sitting here,
telling people what to do.

127
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,998
- I think you'd better go.
- I'm going baby. I'm going!

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,031
It's Jerry's fault.

129
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:34,496
He took out all my good lines.
He's such a control freak.

130
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:42,170
So you send me to this therapist to
help me with my emotional disorders...

131
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,510
...and she criticizes our script.

132
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,675
What kind of a therapist is that?

133
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,378
Well, I guess she didn't
think it was funny.

134
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:53,458
Oh, she didn't think it was funny.
What is she, Rowan and Martin?

135
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,994
We're supposed to meet
with NBC tomorrow.

136
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,993
She completely shattered
my confidence.

137
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,394
And I'm paying for this.
She's my employee.

138
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:05,504
- I thought your mother's paying for it.
- And she slaves to earn every penny...

139
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:08,800
...so that someday I might be able
to walk up to a woman and say:

140
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:12,536
"Yes, I'm bald,
but I'm still a good person."

141
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,306
He's right. It's not her place
to criticize the script.

142
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:18,383
Which reminds me. What did you
think of it? You never told me

143
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,516
- What did I think of it?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:24,820
Hey, buddy,
I got something to tell you.

145
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:28,222
Now, one second. You won't get off
that easy. Tell me what you thought.

146
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:31,091
- Well, you know...
- I just kissed Gail Cunningham.

147
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,732
- You what?
- Yeah, I kissed her.

148
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,600
- You kissed her?
- Right on the mouth.

149
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:42,401
What kind of great friend are you?

150
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,440
How do you go
from snubbing to kissing?

151
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:48,411
I saw her outside the Y. She came up
to me, she started yelling...

152
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:52,278
...because I snubbed her.
Then we started talking a little bit...

153
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:56,081
...and I walked her to her building.
And just before I left...

154
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:59,225
...I put my arm around her waist.
I pulled her to me...

155
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:01,451
...and I planted one.

156
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:06,158
- What did she do?
- She kissed me back.

157
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:09,961
I don't get this. I go out with this girl
three times, she won't shake my hand.

158
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:12,195
Why is she kissing you?

159
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:16,570
Because I snubbed her.
You see? Women, they like that.

160
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:18,176
Yes, I understand women.

161
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:21,802
The snub is good.
They love the snub.

162
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,974
No they don't. I tried that once.

163
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:27,551
I snubbed for a year. Nothing.

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,349
Every woman I saw, I snubbed.
You never saw people so pleased.

165
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:37,361
So I understand you're buying
new shoes now at Botticelli's.

166
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,964
What? Who told you that?

167
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,862
Gail Cunningham.

168
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:45,662
I don't understand. Why is this woman
talking about my shoes?

169
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,865
Why are my shoes a topic
of conversation?

170
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,636
We were just talking,
and she mentioned...

171
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:54,177
...how you're buying your
shoes now at Botticelli's.

172
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:57,680
How I'm buying my shoes now
at Botticelli's.

173
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,375
Did you hear this?

174
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,054
So what?

175
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:08,958
So what? She is talking about my
shoes. She is discussing my shoes.

176
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,463
It is nobody's business where
I buy my shoes.

177
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,868
- Hey, Gail?
- Yeah.

178
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:27,904
Elaine.

179
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,174
- Why are you talking about my shoes?
- What?

180
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,319
My Botticelli shoes. You've been
talking about my Botticelli shoes.

181
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:34,748
What are you talking about?

182
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,823
Did you or did you not tell Kramer
that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?

183
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,459
Too spicy. He wants another one.

184
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:43,994
- You got that pasta primavera?
- Elaine, I am very busy here.

185
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,959
Who else have you mentioned
my shoes to?

186
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:48,930
I want to know why my footwear
is your conversation?

187
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,995
I am not discussing this.
This is insane.

188
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:53,867
You got that pasta primavera?
Let's go!

189
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,945
Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.

190
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:09,017
Sorry for the delay.
Enjoy your lunch.

191
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,456
- Well, come in. Come in.
- Hi.

192
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:12,852
- Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,493
Sorry to make you come up here...

194
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:17,425
...but I wasn't feeling well
enough to go back to the office.

195
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:20,566
Well, it's the only chance I have
to meet with you this week.

196
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,462
- Are you all right?
- It's my stomach.

197
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:26,162
There must have been something in
the pasta primavera I had for lunch.

198
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,598
- Where did you eat?
- Pfeiffer's.

199
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,469
- I know the chef there.
- Food is usually terrific.

200
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,840
My cousin worked for Bouchard's.

201
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:38,074
They used to use the bouillabaise
for a toilet.

202
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,509
What are you saying?

203
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,155
Well, you didn't hear it from me,
but needless to say...

204
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:46,156
...if you go in there,
stick with the consommé.

205
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,960
We better get started.
My daughter's gonna be here soon.

206
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,356
Oh, you have a daughter.

207
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,260
- She just turned 15 last week.
- That's a fun age.

208
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,661
Yeah.

209
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:56,463
All right.

210
00:10:57,437 --> 00:11:00,929
The script. Now, I've read
this thing three times.

211
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:02,335
Yeah?

212
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:05,367
And every time I read it...

213
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,410
What?

214
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:14,418
- Excuse me for a second.
- What?

215
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,852
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.

216
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,449
You think he liked it?

217
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,422
I'm not sure.

218
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,773
- What was that dish he said...
- Pasta primavera.

219
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,907
You know,
"primavera" is Italian for "spring."

220
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,382
- No?
- Yeah.

221
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,818
Really, I'm terribly sorry. It's just...

222
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,289
...all of a sudden, it just hit me.

223
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:58,856
So you were saying,
about the script.

224
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,624
Right. The script.

225
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,164
Your script needs...

226
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:05,862
It needs...

227
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,564
- More jokes?
- Another ending?

228
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,402
A different name for the butler?

229
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,881
Maybe we should go.

230
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,246
We haven't heard his notes yet.

231
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,719
We don't know how he feels
about our work.

232
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:31,254
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

233
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,760
I can't listen to anymore of this.
The guy's losing a lung in there.

234
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:40,700
Hello.

235
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,898
- Hi.
- I'm Molly.

236
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:44,737
- I'm Jerry.
- George.

237
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,936
We're discussing our script
with your father.

238
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,740
He just read it.

239
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:55,577
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, sweetie, I'm fine.

240
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:01,287
- So you live with your mother?
- Yeah.

241
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:05,963
Divorce is very difficult,
especially on the kid

242
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:08,930
Of course, I'm the result of my parents
having stayed together.

243
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,262
So you never know.

244
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,201
Crapshoot.

245
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,101
Dad, you all right?
What's the matter?

246
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:17,299
- It's just a stomach thing.
- Yuck.

247
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:19,411
We're gonna have to do this
some other time.

248
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,673
So if you give me your number,
I'll call you later.

249
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,619
Suddenly I'm in the mood
for pasta primavera myself.

250
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:41,391
Get a good look, Costanza?

251
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:48,603
- What were you doing?
- It's not my fault. You poked me.

252
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:52,040
You're supposed to just
take a peek after a poke.

253
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:55,146
You were like you just put a quarter
in one of those metal things...

254
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:56,975
...on top
of the Empire State Building

255
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,675
It was cleavage.
I couldn't look away.

256
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:03,310
What, am I waiting to win an Oscar
here? This is all I have in my life.

257
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:07,486
Looking at cleavage is like looking
at the sun. You don't stare at it.

258
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,594
It's too risky.

259
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:13,193
- You get a sense of it, then look away.
- All right.

260
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,329
He caught me in a cleavage peek.
So big deal.

261
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,993
Who wouldn't look at cleavage?
She's got nice cleavage.

262
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:21,537
- That's why I poked.
- Why I peeked.

263
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,669
- Hi.
- Hey.

264
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,937
- What is with your friend Elaine?
- What?

265
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:30,640
She comes to my restaurant,
comes right in my kitchen...

266
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:33,308
...starts complaining
that I'm talking about her shoes.

267
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,352
- She did?
- Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.

268
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:38,581
I don't like people coming
into my kitchen.

269
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,955
I think she sneezed all
over someone's pasta primavera.

270
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:45,222
Someone might have gotten sick
because of her.

271
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,370
- Pasta primavera?
- Is that what she said?

272
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:58,541
Hey, she's something, huh? She's
a wild one. She's wearing me out.

273
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:01,202
- She is?
- She's real sensual.

274
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,213
You know, with the cooking and all.

275
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,649
Hello?

276
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:15,221
Hi, Stu.

277
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,157
- From NBC?
- Yeah.

278
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,127
What's going on?

279
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:22,229
What? Really?

280
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,333
Oh, my God.

281
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,697
Did he give you a reason?

282
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,301
Oh, boy.

283
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:31,068
Okay. All right. Thanks.

284
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,935
Dalrymple just canceled the pilot.

285
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:39,417
If you hadn't gone there,
this wouldn't have happened.

286
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:42,452
I don't like people talking about
my shoes behind my back, okay?

287
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:44,419
My shoes are my business.

288
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,923
You two shouldn't have been looking
at some 15-year-old's cleavage.

289
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:51,086
- He poked me!
- There was cleavage in the area.

290
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:55,129
That's a reflex.
Cleavage, poke. Cleavage, poke.

291
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,100
But she was 15.

292
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,034
You don't consider age
in the face of cleavage.

293
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:03,664
This occurs on a molecular level.
You can't control it.

294
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:05,674
We're like some kind of weird fish...

295
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,473
...where the eyes operate
independently of the head.

296
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:11,139
What's the difference?
What are we gonna do now?

297
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,751
He won't take our calls.
We can't get into his office.

298
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,582
You know what we could do?
He eats at Pfeiffer's.

299
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:19,748
We can have Gail call us when he's
there, go there and talk to him.

300
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:22,394
- You're on to something.
- The whole thing is so stupid.

301
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:25,963
Like he wouldn't do the same thing
if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.

302
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:28,890
- Well, maybe not Elaine, but...
- No.

303
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,259
- Somebody like Gail, though.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:33,905
What? What do you mean Gail?

305
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:35,472
What?

306
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,439
Hey, Kramer, listen,
I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor.

307
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:41,478
The next time Russell Dalrymple
comes in the restaurant...

308
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:44,946
...ask her if she would call me.
- All right, I'll call her right now.

309
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:48,751
What do you mean Gail?

310
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:52,652
You don't think I can attract attention,
put asses in the seats?

311
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:57,759
Look, sweetheart,
you know you've got it all.

312
00:16:57,964 --> 00:16:59,625
But let's face it...

313
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,795
- She said she'll do it.
- All right.

314
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,433
- Great. Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

315
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:04,934
But she wants the shoes.

316
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,698
- What?
- She says she wants those shoes.

317
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,341
She wants my shoes?

318
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,272
What kind of person is this?

319
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:16,108
- She is not getting them.
- Come on, I'll buy you another pair.

320
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:18,910
No, these were the last pair
of these that they had.

321
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:22,213
- I'll get you another just like it.
- But these were the only cool ones.

322
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,846
Don't you see how everybody likes
them and everybody talks about them?

323
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,357
Elaine...

324
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:38,163
...this pilot, it doesn't matter to me.
It's not me I'm concerned about...

325
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:42,532
...it's my mother. She's already been
in the hospital this year.

326
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,700
- Yeah, because she caught you...
- Never mind!

327
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:49,109
Oh, come on. Wait a second.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

328
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:51,408
How do I even know she wears
the same size?

329
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,052
- All right, what size are you?
- Seven and a half.

330
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,687
Bingo.

331
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,395
Sauce this.

332
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,397
Yeah, he's here.

333
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:16,173
Oh, and one more thing,
bring the shoes.

334
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:27,214
Hey, will you look!

335
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:29,752
Fancy meeting you here.

336
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:31,583
Hello.

337
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:35,090
Pasta primavera. Back on the horse.

338
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,726
It's funny, after the pilot got canceled,
we hadn't heard from you.

339
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:43,062
- We didn't hear anything.
- We were wondering what happened.

340
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:47,069
Well, it just didn't seem to be
the right project for us right now.

341
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,408
So, what were you saying?

342
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,287
The show. Because if it had anything
at all to do...

343
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,447
...with what you perceived as me...

344
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:08,627
...leering at your daughter,
I really have to take issue with that.

345
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:11,285
- I did not leer. Did I leer?
- No leer.

346
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:14,961
Excuse me.

347
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:18,399
- Are you using that ketchup?
- No.

348
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,840
Because if I'm looking...

349
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:30,413
...straight ahead and something
enters my field of vision...

350
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,915
...that's merely a happenstance.

351
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:34,746
Look, under the circumstances...

352
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,515
...I don't really feel that we should be
in business together.

353
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:40,749
Here's your ketchup back.

354
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:45,095
You know, I had the hardest time
trying to get some out. I just kept...

355
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,664
...pounding and pounding
on the bottom of it.

356
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,358
- Do you ever have any trouble?
- No.

357
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:54,698
Do you have a ketchup secret?

358
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,341
No...

359
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,369
Don't have a ketchup secret.

360
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:04,745
Because if you do have
a ketchup secret...

361
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,785
...I would really, really like to know
what it is.

362
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:19,988
Field of vision, huh?

363
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,928
How's everything?

364
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,366
- Really good.
- This pasta primavera is fabulous.

365
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:28,735
- Very tasty.
- How did it go with that NBC guy?

366
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:30,842
Great. Pilot is back on.

367
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,638
In fact, Elaine's going out
with him tomorrow night.

368
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,047
Hey, listen, Elaine...

369
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:39,741
...if Russell mentions anything
about the pilot...

370
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,444
...you'll, of course,
tell him how much you liked it.

371
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:46,751
You know I happen to have the script
right here with me...

372
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:49,019
...and on page three, for example...

373
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:52,323
...suppose the Elaine character
comes in wearing...

374
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,897
...a low-cut dress...

375
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:58,594
...and the butler is very distracted
and can't work.

376
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:02,463
That kind of comedy,
that's a little broad for us.

377
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:05,043
I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.

378
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,968
- Well, it's a funny idea.
- It's funny.

379
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:10,081
- Come on, funny is funny.
- Funny's funny.

380
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,479
We're here to entertain, right?

381
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,818
All right.

382
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,488
Well, maybe I'll mention it
to Russell tomorrow night.

383
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:19,681
- lf you can.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:22,692
- Where is he taking you, by the way?
- Bouchard's, on 53rd.

385
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,903
I think what he's trying to say is,
"Get the bouillabaise."

386
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,910
Men are obsessed with cleavage,
women are obsessed with shoes.

387
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,611
It's the same for both sexes.
It doesn't matter...

388
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,188
...how many times
we've seen these things.

389
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:54,918
Every time these objects
are presented to us...

390
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:57,119
...we have to look.
We cannot not look.

391
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,890
To men,
cleavage is like the nearest thing...

392
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,795
...to a nearby UFO landing.
That's what it is.

393
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:06,734
Women, if women buy a pair
of shoes that they really love...

394
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:09,340
...this is like boarding the alien ship.

395
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:11,339
It's possible that aliens
have landed...

396
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,978
...and they haven't been able
to get our attention...

397
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,671
...because we're so preoccupied
with cleavage and shoes.
