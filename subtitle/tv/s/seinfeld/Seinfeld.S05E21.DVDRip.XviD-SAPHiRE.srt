1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,233
Human fascination with water
is amazing.

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,340
We're constantly going
to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,477
We're swimming, we're snorkeling,
we're scuba-diving.

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,078
We bathe in it.
Our bodies are mostly made of water.

5
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,579
Everyone's carrying around
these bottles of water.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,047
We can't get enough water.

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,412
Unless it rains...

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,713
...then we're like,
''Oh, look, l'm soaked.

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,524
l am literally drenched.''

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:30,756
For some reason, we have a huge
problem with small, flying water.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,955
lt'll just stop us right in our tracks.

12
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,894
''l felt a drop.

13
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,966
We're gonna get caught in it!

14
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,540
Everyone cover
your water bottles. Run!''

15
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,646
Get off at the next exit.

16
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,942
Kramer, l've driven
to East Hampton many times.

17
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,311
l know the exit.

18
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,350
l hear it's a great house.
Pool, sun deck.

19
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,681
Yeah, l'll be there.

20
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,482
You sure we're making
the right move?

21
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,922
We gotta see the new baby. At least
we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons.

22
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,528
-Didn't they just have a baby?
-That was two years ago.

23
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,324
Remember?
''Jerry, you gotta see the baby.

24
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,900
You gotta see the baby.''

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,631
ls it possible they're just having
babies to get people to visit them?

26
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,740
Hey, Jerry, you ever
wear silk underwear?

27
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,405
-No.
-Put that on the top of your list.

28
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,516
No, not for me.
A little too delightful.

29
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,848
George and Jane
should be almost there.

30
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,885
lsn't it weird that they
haven't had sex...

31
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,920
...but they're spending
a weekend together?

32
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,753
George is pleased.
lt's like she signed a letter of intent.

33
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,259
-When's Rachel coming out?
-The 3:00 train.

34
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,691
Her father is so religious.

35
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,957
l'm amazed he's letting you
see her again...

36
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,931
...after that <i>Schindler's List</i>
make-out session.

37
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,866
l brought him some kishke.

38
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,972
-What's that?
-lt's a stuffed meat thing.

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,234
lsraeli soldiers carry it in case
they're captured behind enemy lines.

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,435
They eat it and it kills them.

41
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,914
l never tasted a cough medicine
l didn't love.

42
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,747
Me too. l love cough medicine.

43
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,685
You see? We were made
for each other.

44
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,390
<i>It's amazing. If I reach out</i>
<i>and touch her breast right now...</i>

45
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,654
<i>...she'd scream and throw me</i>
<i>out of the car.</i>

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,266
<i>But at this time tomorrow,</i>
<i>I could touch it all I want.</i>

47
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,958
-What's your favorite?
-Pertussin.

48
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,071
-Ever try it with club soda?
-No.

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,571
Oh, very refreshing.

50
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,172
<i>Sex is like joining a private club.</i>

51
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,743
<i>I'll be the same me tomorrow...</i>

52
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,040
<i>...but suddenly the ''no trespassing''</i>
<i>sign will be gone.</i>

53
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,350
-Are we almost there?
-Yeah, about 1 0, 1 5 minutes.

54
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,248
But l have to stop
at a vegetable stand.

55
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,287
-What for?
-My mother loves Hampton tomatoes.

56
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,051
She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.

57
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,191
Can you buy them later?

58
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,058
l really wanna get some sun.

59
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,827
Hey, Jerry, rub some lotion
on my back.

60
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,665
Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?

61
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,204
Come on. l'll rub some on you.

62
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,639
-That's not sweetening the deal.
-Oh, come on.

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,868
No.

64
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,672
You know, when l was a kid...

65
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,476
...l once found $ 1 .50 in change
at the bottom of a pool.

66
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,211
-You must have been excited.
-Yeah.

67
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,884
l gotta go get those tomatoes.
You wanna go?

68
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:14,425
-l don't think so.
-Okay. l'll see you later.

69
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,293
-Anybody want some tomatoes?
-No, thanks.

70
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,433
l'm gonna take a dip.

71
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,935
And then there's Maude.

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,532
Look at my face.
Look at it.

73
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,302
-Do you see any lines?
-No lines.

74
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,605
You know why?
One word: shade.

75
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,750
So when are we gonna see this baby?
When is this momentous event?

76
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,612
He's taking a nap or something.

77
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,411
l'm gonna go see if there are
any girls on the beach.

78
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,648
-Elaine, you wanna come?
-No, thanks.

79
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,917
l got plenty of girlfriends.

80
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,757
Well, this is interesting.

81
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,194
What?

82
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,336
Jane's topless.

83
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,168
Yo-Yo Ma.

84
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,107
Boutros Boutros-Golly.

85
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,579
Nice rack.

86
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,514
Come on, you guys.
You can come and see the baby now.

87
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:16,553
-Oh, in a minute, Carol.
-Yeah, we're gonna be right up.

88
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,590
This is weird, wild stuff.

89
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,459
George hasn't even seen her yet.

90
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,756
Why do you think we're getting
the sneak preview?

91
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,627
Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.

92
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:32,634
-What?
-Get some good word of mouth going.

93
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,933
Oh, here she comes.

94
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,213
l'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?

95
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,113
No, thanks.

96
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,054
l'm good.

97
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,860
All right. Show's over.
l'm going to the beach.

98
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,042
Adam, Jerry and Elaine are here.

99
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,645
Where is the cute little
snuggly baby?

100
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,374
-lsn't he gorgeous?
-Oh, he's--

101
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,315
ls he gorgeous.

102
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,652
Gorgeous, yes.

103
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,558
So very gorgeous.

104
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,392
Michael, shut the door.
You're letting bugs in.

105
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:18,742
ls it me or was that the ugliest baby
you have ever seen?

106
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,070
l couldn't look.

107
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,374
lt was like a Pekingese.

108
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,748
Boy, a little too much chlorine
in that gene pool.

109
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,716
The thing is, they'll never know.
No one's ever gonna tell them.

110
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,360
-You have to lie.
-Oh, it's a must-lie situation.

111
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,826
Yes. lt's a must-lie situation.

112
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,262
You know, l don't think we should
tell George we saw Jane topless.

113
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,231
No. l don't think so.

114
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,735
Remind me to tell Kramer too.

115
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,911
Lobster.

116
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,911
-Well, this ointment should do it.
-How are you feeling, Adam?

117
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,721
Elaine. This is our pediatrician,
Ben Pfeffer.

118
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,355
Hi.

119
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,428
Look at him, Elaine.
How gorgeous is he, l ask you?

120
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,430
How gorgeous?

121
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,933
Pretty gorgeous.

122
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,234
-Elaine, do you have children?
-Me? No, but l'd love to have a baby.

123
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,310
l mean, l can't wait to have a baby.
l'm just dying to have a baby.

124
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,211
A beautiful woman like you should.
You're quite breathtaking.

125
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,247
Breathtaking?

126
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,888
l'm breathtaking?

127
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,956
And he's very particular.

128
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,252
Ben, you're staying
over tonight, right?

129
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,020
Sure.

130
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,499
l<i>....</i>

131
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,766
l'm gonna go pick up Rachel
at the station.

132
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,837
-Yeah, see you.
-Okay.

133
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,734
Oh, just look at him.

134
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,571
Yeah, he really is breathtaking.

135
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,683
The train was so crowded,
l had a seat facing the wrong way.

136
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,552
Oh, l like that.
lt's like going back in time.

137
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,186
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.

138
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,330
-l'm gonna go in and get changed.
-Okay.

139
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,424
What kind of a greeting was that?

140
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,299
-She's got greeting problems.
-Yeah.

141
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,603
Boy, l love these Hampton tomatoes.

142
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,004
You know, you can eat them
like apples.

143
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,010
lt's funny. The tomato never really
took off as a hand fruit.

144
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,579
Well, the tomato's an anomaly.

145
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,807
So successful with the ketchup
and the sauce...

146
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,451
...but you can't find a good one.

147
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,882
Look at what l got!

148
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,318
The K-man!

149
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,051
You got lobster for everybody?

150
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,595
Yeah, and they're fresh.
Right out of the ocean!

151
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,995
This is fantastic.
Man, what a weekend!

152
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,896
Swimming, lobster for dinner.

153
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,559
l know. lt's great.

154
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,036
l saw Jane topless.

155
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,285
You saw who what?

156
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,890
Yeah, l saw Jane topless.
Well, we all saw her.

157
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,285
All right.

158
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,396
You saw Jane topless?

159
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,001
Well, when you went for the
tomatoes, she lied out topless.

160
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,865
Oh, you mean facedown
on her chest.

161
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,666
No.

162
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,775
-Faceup on her back?
-Yeah.

163
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,312
-Well, why'd she do that?
-Well, l guess she was hot.

164
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,240
You mean she just
lay there topless?

165
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,181
No, no. She got up,
she walked around.

166
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,945
Walked around?

167
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,817
-And you looked?
-Of course.

168
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,424
She's got a great body, buddy.

169
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,756
All right, l'm gonna go upstairs.
l'll be right back.

170
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,625
l can't believe that you saw her
before me!

171
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,360
Think of me as a doctor.

172
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:08,740
-Well, how good a look did you get?
-What do you mean?

173
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,240
Well, if she was a criminal...

174
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,107
...and you had to describe her
to a police sketch artist...?

175
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,480
They'd pick her up
in about 1 0 minutes.

176
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,918
Great. Great.

177
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,023
So any time you want,
you can just visualize her naked.

178
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,616
l guess that's true.

179
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,852
Stop it. Stop it.

180
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,462
This is not fair! lt's not fair.

181
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,496
l don't like this.
l don't like it one bit.

182
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,066
What do you want me to do?
You wanna see Rachel naked?

183
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,533
Yes! Yes!

184
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,003
-Yeah, right.
-The punishment should fit the crime.

185
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,574
You could see me naked.
l could offer you that.

186
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,836
lt's like l'm Neil Armstrong.

187
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:51,074
l turn around for a sip of Tang
and you jump out first!

188
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,581
Nobody ever called me
breathtaking before.

189
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,281
l've never been called
breathtaking either.

190
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,022
l mean, if he thinks that
that baby is breathtaking...

191
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,958
...then who's not breathtaking?

192
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,691
Maybe he just said it
because the mother was in the room.

193
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,301
Yeah. Right.
That's a possibility.

194
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,868
l have to find out.

195
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,666
-How you gonna do that?
-l can be very clever.

196
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,071
-l'm gonna take a swim.
-Oh, me too. l'll meet you down there.

197
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,737
Don't go in.
Rachel's getting undressed.

198
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,642
Oh, okay.

199
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,520
-Hey!
-Oh, sorry.

200
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,521
-Don't you knock?
-l'm sorry.

201
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,989
Not like l'll see something
l've never seen before.

202
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,354
-You might have.
-l didn't.

203
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,052
You won't.

204
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,722
What do you want anyway, George?

205
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,596
Yes, George. l'm kind of
wondering myself.

206
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,033
What is it that you want?

207
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,574
No, l was just wondering
if you guys had any gum.

208
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,170
So you were swimming
in the pool...

209
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,577
...and you wanted some gum.

210
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,810
Yes, because the water
was cold...

211
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,682
...and the chewing warms me up.

212
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,592
We don't have any gum.

213
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,228
Okay. Thanks anyway.

214
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,259
Strange man.

215
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,594
Wait till you get to know him.

216
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,169
-So where is this baby, anyway?
-Oh, check it out.

217
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,172
l guarantee you've never seen
anything quite so objectionable.

218
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,640
lt's down the hall,
third door on your left.

219
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,177
Oh, my God!

220
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,983
l'm sorry, l thought this was
the baby's room.

221
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,518
l'm really sorry.

222
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,665
l was in the pool!

223
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,233
l was in the pool!

224
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,339
Did she do it on purpose?

225
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,378
lt was my fault.
l told her the wrong door.

226
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,480
l was supposed to see her.
She wasn't supposed to see me.

227
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,044
So what?

228
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,715
Well, ordinarily l wouldn't mind.
But<i>....</i>

229
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,149
But what?

230
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,390
Well, l'd just got back
from swimming in the pool...

231
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,996
...and the water was cold.

232
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,229
-You mean shrinkage.
-Yes.

233
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,430
Significant shrinkage.

234
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,437
So you feel you were shortchanged?

235
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,075
Yes.

236
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,212
lf she thinks that's me, she's under
a complete misapprehension.

237
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,245
That was not me, Jerry.
That was not me.

238
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,246
Well, so, what's the difference?

239
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,875
-What if she discusses it with Jane?
-Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.

240
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,885
-How do you know?
-Women aren't like us.

241
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,047
They're worse!
They're much worse than us.

242
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,386
They talk about everything.

243
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,552
Could you tell her about
the shrinkage factor?

244
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,856
No. l'm not gonna tell her
about your shrinkage.

245
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,592
Besides, l think women know
about shrinkage.

246
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,395
How do women know
about shrinkage?

247
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,629
lsn't it common knowledge?

248
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:00,999
-Elaine.
-Elaine.

249
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,697
Elaine!

250
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,874
-What?
-Do women know about shrinkage?

251
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,605
What do you mean, like laundry?

252
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,605
No.

253
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,845
Like when a man goes swimming,
afterwards<i>....</i>

254
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,587
lt shrinks?

255
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,254
Like a frightened turtle.

256
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,332
-Why does it shrink?
-lt just does.

257
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,867
l don't know how you guys
walk around with those things.

258
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,938
-Excellent lobster, Kramer.
-Really good.

259
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,247
Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?

260
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,545
No, l can't.

261
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,916
l'm kosher. We don't eat shellfish.

262
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,615
You mean you've
never tasted lobster?

263
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,088
No.

264
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,589
You're so pious.

265
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,322
l really respect that.

266
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,727
You know, when you die...

267
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,199
...you're gonna get
some special attention.

268
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,906
The baby's crying.
l'll go get him, he can sit with us.

269
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,009
No, no. You don't want to do that.

270
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,236
-You'll be uncomfortable.
-Yeah. Finish eating.

271
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,472
The baby's not gonna have
any fun over here.

272
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,549
-We're not fun for a baby.
-Yeah.

273
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,344
The lobsters will scare him.

274
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,389
l'm gonna get him.

275
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,659
See? Look at this.

276
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,892
Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk.

277
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,193
lt used to be much bigger,
and now it shrunk.

278
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,061
See, that's what water does.

279
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,297
lt shrinks things.

280
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,239
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science.

281
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,546
What are you doing?
What are you laughing at?

282
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,810
-lt's nothing, George.
-lt's very impolite to tell secrets.

283
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,819
-Are you talking about me?
-What is it with you?

284
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,548
Easy, big fella.

285
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,790
Kramer, where did you
get these lobsters?

286
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,624
-At MacLeish's Fish Market?
-No. l got them in the ocean.

287
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,827
The ocean? What do you mean?

288
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,561
Well, l found this rope
and l kept tugging on it...

289
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,398
...all these lobsters came up.

290
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,669
Those are commercial lobster traps.
You can't take lobsters from there.

291
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,936
-That's against the law.
-Hey, take it easy.

292
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,580
There are plenty of lobsters
in the ocean for everyone.

293
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,341
My father was a lobsterman.

294
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,314
He got up every morning at 4...

295
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,579
...and came home at night
stinking of brine.

296
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,722
He sent me through law school
with the lobsters he caught.

297
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,724
Here he is.

298
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,300
-Some night, huh?
-Yeah.

299
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,535
l wish l had my telescope.

300
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,345
-Some dinner, huh?
-Yeah.

301
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,075
Nothing like really
fresh-caught lobster.

302
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,242
Some house, huh?

303
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,252
lt was built by Mark Farbman.

304
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,549
He built a lot of these homes here.

305
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,325
Some ugly baby, huh?

306
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,461
-What did you say?
-l said...

307
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:18,763
...''some snuggly baby.''

308
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,437
He is something.

309
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,571
Well, to tell you the truth,
Dr. Pfeffer...

310
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,680
...l was surprised to hear you use
a word like ''breathtaking''...

311
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,543
...to describe a baby.

312
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,948
l mean, because you also
used it referring to me.

313
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,784
Well, you know, Elaine, sometimes
you say a thing like that just to be nice.

314
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,894
You told her?

315
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,092
-Yeah. What's the big deal?
-You don't understand this organ.

316
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,863
lt's very schizophrenic.

317
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,571
Anyway, what's the difference?

318
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,300
You're the ones who are
obsessed with this stuff, not us.

319
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,239
l'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.

320
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,777
You're going back
to New York now?

321
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,246
Yeah. l have some things
to do tomorrow.

322
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,147
l think you spoke to your little friend
Rachel, that's what l think.

323
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,823
So what if l did?

324
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,483
And she didn't say something to you
about a certain something?

325
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,357
l don't know what
you're talking about.

326
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,361
l think that you think...

327
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,092
...that a certain something
is not all that it could be...

328
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,034
...when, in fact, it is
all that it should be and more.

329
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,903
-l'm sure it is.
-Look, you don't understand.

330
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,703
There was shrinkage.

331
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,478
You looking for this?

332
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,252
Oh, Kramer. You startled me.

333
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,830
Well, l thought you might
wind up around here.

334
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,330
Yeah, well, l couldn't stop...

335
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,800
...thinking about the way everybody
was enjoying the lobster so much.

336
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,769
And, well, l thought a little taste
couldn't hurt.

337
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,068
-May l?
-No, l'm afraid l couldn't do that.

338
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,874
-Why not?
-Well, now, it wouldn't be kosher.

339
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,713
Come on, Kramer.
l really wanna try it.

340
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,649
No, l'm sorry, honey.
Not on my watch.

341
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,551
Come on, Kramer.

342
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,555
l just heard a car drive out.
What was that?

343
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,791
Oh, just Jane driving back
to New York in the middle of the night.

344
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,999
George, thanks so much
for making breakfast.

345
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,269
These are the best
scrambled eggs ever.

346
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,741
l didn't know you could cook.

347
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,371
Well, l'm just expressing my gratitude
to our gracious host.

348
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,848
Yes, George, the whole breakfast
is breathtaking.

349
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,981
-Good morning.
-Hey!

350
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,921
-Hey, morning.
-Morning.

351
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,994
Kramer, l wanna thank you
again for last night.

352
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,529
-You really saved me.
-What happened?

353
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,461
Well, l almost tried the lobster...

354
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,932
...but Kramer stopped me.

355
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,072
Well, l knew you'd regret it
for the rest of your life.

356
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,968
You're right. l would have.

357
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,973
Hey, look at this guy.

358
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,078
-A little breakfast?
-Yeah.

359
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,544
-And you eat eggs, don't you?
-Yes, l do.

360
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,513
-All right.
-Thank you.

361
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,413
Delicious. Where did you learn
to make eggs like this?

362
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,120
These are so good.

363
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,918
Enjoying them?

364
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,583
Oh, good.

365
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:36,161
You know, you might wanna try
eating it with one of these.

366
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,704
There's lobster in these eggs?

367
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,963
Not that much.

368
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,664
You know, they tend
to shrink in the water.

369
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,479
Well, l guess l gotta go too.

370
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,772
Well, this has turned out
to be one hell of a weekend.

371
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,882
Excuse me.

372
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,648
Sorry to bother you.

373
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,020
We're trying to track down
a lobster poacher...

374
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,923
...that cleaned out one of the traps.

375
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,254
l wonder what's going on.

376
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,430
Guess l should go up
and apologize.

377
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,967
-There he is, officer.
-Yeah.

378
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,637
Don't you ever knock?!

379
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,203
l don't know why Rachel had
to drive back with Michael and Carol.

380
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,575
Hey, if you saw me naked...

381
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,309
...l wouldn't wanna ride
in the same car with you either.

382
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,680
l still can't believe
Michael finked on Kramer.

383
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,187
How is he gonna pay off
a $ 1 000 fine?

384
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,621
They got some sort of program.

385
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,021
What?

386
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,429
Hey, there's a tomato stand.
Let's stop. l can get some more.

387
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,105
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?

388
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,541
-There's Rachel.
-Where?

389
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,090
Look at the work that people
will do to get to the ocean.

390
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,526
They'll fight traffic and the heat
and the parking and the hot sand...

391
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,359
...trying to get through the waves...

392
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,898
...and the ironic thing is...

393
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,526
...the ocean doesn't
even really want us in there.

394
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,831
That's what surfing is.

395
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,840
Surfing is the ocean
throwing us out of itself.

396
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,477
You see?

397
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,077
We keep trying to paddle in...

398
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,976
...and the ocean is saying,
''No, you don't.''

399
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,874
The ocean is like a nightclub...

400
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,884
...and the waves are bouncers
tossing us out.

401
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,079
The undertow is like
the really mean bouncer.

402
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,487
lnstead of throwing you out, they take
you in the back and rough you up.

403
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,720
''Oh, you wanna come in?
How about coming in like 25 miles?''
