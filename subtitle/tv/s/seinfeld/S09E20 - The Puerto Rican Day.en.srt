1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Man, I'm starving.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,000
How can you be hungry 
after what you ate at that Mets game?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Because ballpark food 
doesn't count as real food.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,700
Right. It's just an activity. 

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,200
It's like that paddle 
with the ball and the rubber band.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,400
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano 
made a fortune off of those.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,400
See, he came up with the idea 
for the rubber band. 

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Before that, people would just hit the ball, 
and it would fly away.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,900
I can't believe you all 
made me leave before the end of the game.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,800
Oh, come on, Jerry. 

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
It was 9 to nothing. 
We were getting shellacked.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
Those nachos are killing me.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,100
I thought you were hungry.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,600
It's complicated.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,800
Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,600
Keep your shirt on. I got it.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,500
Watch out for that maroon Golf.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Oh, boy.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,800
This guy is trying to box me out.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,300
I'll tell you when you can go. 

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait-- 

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,100
now, now, now. 

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,400
No, no, no. 

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Go, go! 

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,100
No, no. 

26
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,100
Wait-- 

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,000
now, now! 

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,700
Now! 

29
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Jerry! Go--

30
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,900
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. 

31
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,800
He thinks I cut him off. 
He accelerated.

32
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
You want me to moon him? 
Ooh, let's moon him. 

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,300
Roll up your window. 
Let's do a pressed ham under glass.

34
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,100
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

35
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Look at this, look at this. 
He's giving us the finger.

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, all right.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,500
So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.

38
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, yeah. What's that called?

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,200
Blimp: The Hindenburg Story.

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,300
How was it?

41
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,800
I found it morose. 

42
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,100
Why dwell on these negative themes?

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Yeah. They should make a movie 
about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.

44
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,400
Anyway, right in the middle-- 

45
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,900
the ship blows up-- 
burning debris, bodies falling-- 

46
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,900
and then just as this eerie silence 
settles over the airfield, 

47
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,600
I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,400
The place went nuts.

49
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten 
if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.

50
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,900
Yeah.

51
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,200
Why are we slowing down?

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,700
What is that music?

53
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,700
What's with all these flags?

54
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,100
Oh, no.

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,800
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!

56
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth Avenue. 
They never let anyone through.

57
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,500
We're never getting home.

58
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
All right. I'm gonna check it out. 

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Aaah! Mucho tráfico!

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,100
Well, the streets are all blocked. 

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,500
I think every Puerto Rican 
in the world is out here.

62
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Well, it is our day.

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.

64
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,700
<i>And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.

65
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,300
See? If we had stayed, 
we could have seen those runs.

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,500
I could have had some ice cream. 

67
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,200
That might have calmed down the nachos.

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. 

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,700
It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.

71
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,700
I don't know how you can unwind 
with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. 
I think we can get out over there.

73
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,300
But that's a one-way street 
coming this way. 

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,200
Besides, how am I gonna get 
all the way over there?

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Just inch over. 
You worm your way.

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,700
Just do it, Jerry. 

77
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,200
This exhaust. 
I'm gonna throw up.

78
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,000
You know, you should 
make yourself throw up.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,100
Huh?

80
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,200
You know you're going to.

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,000
All right, I'm worming.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hey, Jerry. 

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You know who the grand marshal is 
of this thing? 

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,700
None other than Miss Chita Rivera.

85
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,900
They're not letting me in.

86
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,000
My hand is out.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,100
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. 

88
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,800
They have to see a human face.

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,900
You sure you want his face?

90
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,300
No, no, no. 
It was María Conchita Alonso.

91
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,000
This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,400
The stare-ahead. I hate that. 
I use it all the time.

93
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Look at me! 
I am man! I am you!

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,900
All right, he's letting you in. 
Thank you! Creep.

95
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Oh! I know who it is. 
Stacy Keach.

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,700
One more lane to go.

97
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,700
All right! We're here!

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, look who's here. 
My old buddy, black Saab.

99
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Maroon Golf.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where you going, black Saab? 
You seem to be a tad askew.

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Could you move your car back a little?

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,800
Oh. Sorry. 
I seem to have cut you off.

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,700
All right, I think I know 
where this is going, 

104
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,700
and I am going somewhere else.

105
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,100
You can't do that. 
You can't just leave the group.

106
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,800
I've been trying to 
leave this group for 10 years. 

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,900
Vaya con dios.

108
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,400
¿Con dios? 
Well, that's rude.

109
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Can you believe her?

110
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,900
Yeah. I'll see you later.

111
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,100
Where are you going?

112
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,700
The movies. 
Blimp is playing right there.

113
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,500
You're going to that again? 
Why? Just to do that stupid line?

114
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a performance, Jerry. 
Like what you do.

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,900
That's not what I do.

116
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,300
Isn't it?

117
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,500
Maybe a little. 

118
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Ah, hell, I guess it is.

119
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,400
You know, actually, Jerry, 
you haven't worked a room that big in a while.

120
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,200
Look at that guy's dog. 

121
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I hate it when their ears 
get flipped inside out like that. 

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Why doesn't he fix it?

123
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Hey! 
Fold your dog's ear back!

124
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Oh! This isn't moving! 
I could walk faster than this.

125
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
No, you can't.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, I can. 
Here. I'm outta here.

127
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Oh, now it's moving. 
Oh, yeah. I knew it. 

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Hey! Hey!

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
Where to?

130
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
That's cute. That's really cute. 

131
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Oh! Come on! 

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,500
All right. 

133
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Bye again.

134
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,900
Hey. Taxi! Taxi!

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,900
Ladies. 

136
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,500
I, uh, I haven't seen this before.

137
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
What is that dot?

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, I think someone has 
one of those funny laser pointers.

139
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,100
Gimme a box of those 
and one of those.

140
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Excuse me, are you the guy 
with that funny laser?

141
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,400
The laser's not funny. 
I'm funny.

142
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,500
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...

143
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,300
I had this little zinger of my own 
I wanted to try.

144
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,500
Uh-huh.

145
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,700
It's right in the explosion scene. 

146
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,700
So if you could just...
leave me a little window. 

147
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
You know, my, uh, my aunt 
had a thing removed with a laser. 

148
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,300
All right, I don't want to 
interrupt your meal, so...

149
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,500
<i>What a comeback for the New York Mets.

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,600
<i>Six runs in the bottom of the ninth.

151
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,300
I've gotta see this game. 

152
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,900
If it wasn't for this guy, 
we could get out of here.

153
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,300
This traffic's a killer, aingt it?

154
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,500
You want to get outta here? 
Here's what we do. 

155
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
We leave the car here, 
we take the plates off, 

156
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,400
we scratch the serial number 
off the engine block, and we walk away.

157
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Walk away?

158
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,700
You've got insurance. 

159
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,600
You tell them that the car was stolen, 
and then you get another one free.

160
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Isn't there a deductible?

161
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
All right, what is your deductible?

162
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Yes, because they've already deducted it.

164
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,100
From what?

165
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
The car, which we're leaving. 

166
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,600
So the net is zero. 

167
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
See you pocket the money, 
if there is any, and you get a new car.

168
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,100
We're not leaving the car!

169
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,900
All right. 

170
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,900
If you refuse to grow up 
and scam your insurance company, 

171
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,900
you'll have to work this out 
with maroon Golf.

172
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,100
Absolutely not. He sped up.

173
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,500
<i>Swung on, lined hard 
toward left center field. 

174
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
<i>That's in the gap, 
that's a base hit.

175
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,900
I'm ready to talk.

176
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,300
Hey! There's that laser guy again.

177
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,700
He's funny. 
I never meet anyone funny.

178
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
I know. 

179
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,700
A sense of humor is so much 
more important to me than looks or hair.

180
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Mmm, yeah.

181
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,300
That's gotta hurt!

182
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,200
It's...gotta hurt! 

183
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Hurt! 

184
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300
Because...

185
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,000
Damn you, laser guy! 

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,900
You had to grab it all 
with your lowbrow laser shtick! 

187
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,900
You're just a prop comic! 
Where's the craft?!

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,100
Look! It's on the bald guy.

189
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,100
I am so glad we came to this showing.

190
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
OK, here's the deal. 

191
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,800
He wants you to acknowledge that you 
cut him off with an "I'm sorry" wave.

192
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,900
What's that?

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,500
You raise the hand, lower the head-- 

194
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,400
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
The buttons are really big on the car. 

195
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,600
I don't understand it. 
I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" 

196
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,200
You get my drift.

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
OK!

198
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,600
Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. 

199
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
But I'll take it.

200
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes! 

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,600
All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit 
so we can get out now.

202
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,900
All right. At last, 
we're finally getting out of here.

203
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,500
What's that on your forehead?

204
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,800
It's probably chocolate.

205
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,500
Hey, is that one of those 
laser pointers?

206
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. 

207
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,500
It's a George laserium!

208
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,900
All right, stop it! 

209
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,300
Stay away from my breast! 

210
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,400
Chest!

211
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
See ya around, maroon Golf. 

212
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,300
And, by the way, 
that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.

213
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,000
What was that?

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm glad I cut you off, 
because black Saab rules! 

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,400
So long, jackass!

216
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
Elaine?!

217
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,100
Jerry?!

218
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Jackass? 
So I'm a jackass now?

219
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
So if everyone would just 
put their cars in reverse at the same time, 

220
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,900
we can do this. 

221
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,000
All right, on the count of three. 

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
Can everyone hear me? 

223
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?

224
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,400
Buenos días, my friend.

225
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Not you! 
The guy in the Amigo.

226
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Uh, well-- here--
here is good.

227
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,900
Oh, yeah, sure, 
and now I'm gonna be stuck here. 

228
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,900
But you knew the way to go! 
You went to college!

229
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,700
Hey, I went to Tufts! 
That was my safety school! 

230
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,700
So don't talk to me about hardship.

231
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,300
Boy, can you believe this mess?

232
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,000
Elaine, why did you have the cab 
come down the street?

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,700
We were almost out!

234
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,300
So that was your girlfriend 
that blocked you in. 

235
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,800
That's real good.

236
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm not his girlfriend. 

237
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,600
Well, actually, we used to date, 
but not anymore.

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,500
Elaine, he doesn't need--

239
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,400
Used to date? 

240
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
So I guess you found out he's a jackass.

241
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,400
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.

242
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,300
Wow. He's giving you a mustache. 
Where is this guy?

243
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
Don't look around. Don't look around. 
That's what he wants.

244
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,400
All right. Well, I'll see ya. 

245
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Hey, George, I think there's 
a sniper looking to pop ya.

246
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,400
This thing can't hurt me, can it? 

247
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,400
I mean, it is a laser. 
What if it hits my eye?

248
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,700
I don't know.

249
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
I can't be blind, Jerry.

250
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,200
The blind are courageous.

251
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,700
You'll be fine as long as 
it doesn't hit you right in the pupil,

252
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,700
'cause then the whole ball 
will go up like the Death Star. 

253
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,400
I gotta go find a bathroom.

254
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Hold it, George. Don't move. 
It's right between your eyes.

255
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh, my God.

256
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,600
Hey, there's the soda guy.

257
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,500
Hey, jackass! 
Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!

258
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
All right!

259
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,400
Hey, hey, hey!

260
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh, this is nuts! 
I can't get across anywhere!

261
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Well, none of us can! 
We're trapped!

262
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,900
Hey! 

263
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,800
Hey, everyone this way! 
I think we can get out through here.

264
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
Oh, I don't know 
if that's such a good idea.

265
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Look! No one knows 
how long this parade is gonna last! 

266
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,300
They are a very festive people. 

267
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
All I know is that it's Sunday night, 
and I have got to unwind! 

268
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,200
Now who's with me?

269
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,500
Father?

270
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,500
None of us saw the nylon flap. 
That might mean something.

271
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh, all right, all right!

272
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,100
All right! Come on. Come on. 
Let's go. Let's go.

273
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,000
But it's dark!

274
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Get in there!

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,300
Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.

276
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,900
Yes! Come in, come in.

277
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,400
OK.

278
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,100
I'm Christine Nyhart.

279
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,200
Oh. Delicious to meet you.

280
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,800
Did the broker send you over?

281
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. 

282
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. 

283
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm a wealthy industrialist and 
philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. 

284
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,900
Yes, I'm looking for a place 
where I can settle down 

285
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,900
with my, uh, peculiar habits, 
and, uh, the women that I frequent with. 

286
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,200
 Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?

287
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
The asking price is $1.5 million.

288
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,300
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. 

289
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Yes, I buy and sell 
men like myself every day. 

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Now, I assume that 
there's a waterfall grotto?

291
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
No.

292
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
How about a bathroom?

293
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,600
It has 4.

294
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, and where would 
the absolute nearest one be?

295
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
Just down the hall.

296
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Oh, thank you.

297
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Oh, don't worry. 

298
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,100
We'll get you home to your husband real soon.

299
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
I'm not married.

300
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,600
Well, I, for one, 
really respect that.

301
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,100
Oh, thank you.

302
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,800
Hey! Guess who's not married.

303
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Is the boyfriend 
still in the picture?

304
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,400
Come on, father, you can make it.

305
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,100
No, I can't.
I've got a bad hip. Go on without me.

306
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,700
No! I won't!

307
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,200
Leave me! You must.

308
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,700
All right. Take it easy.

309
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,000
All right, we can move faster 
without Father O'Gimpy.

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,900
I heard that!

311
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,900
You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man 
driving a Saab convertible. 

312
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Still haven't.

313
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,400
What seems to be the problem, officer?

314
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,100
They're for protection, Jerry. 
Can you tell where I'm looking?

315
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,300
At me?

316
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,700
No.

317
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,800
Oh. It's back.

318
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,300
Bring it on, baby.

319
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
What if it gets in the side?

320
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,900
The side?

321
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth 
between your cornea and the mirror, 

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,100
faster and faster, 
getting more and more intense, 

323
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,900
until finally--
- All right!

324
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Oh. It's in your eye now.

325
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,600
Hola, Jerry! 
I'm into this Puerto Rican day! 

326
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,100
The sights! The sounds! 
The hot, spicy flavor of it all! 

327
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,500
It's caliente, Jerry!

328
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,700
Kramer, the Mets 
have got men on base!

329
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Yeah, I know! I was watching the game.

330
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,200
You were watching? Where?

331
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh, that was a strike! 
Did you see that?!

332
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,600
Would you like to see 
the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--

333
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,400
Eh... Varnsen. 
Kel Varnsen. 

334
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,600
Actually, this room intrigues me. 
Why is it called the TV room?

335
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Well, it's--

336
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Balk? How was that a balk?
You have any snacks?

337
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Mr. Varnsen, 
if you like the apartment, 

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I should tell you I've also had 
some interest from a wealthy industrialist.

339
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,500
Not Pennypacker!

340
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,300
You know him?

341
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,800
I wish I didn't. 

342
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,900
Brace yourself, madam, 
for an all-out bidding war. 

343
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,900
But this time, advantage Varnsen!

344
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,700
Wait a second.

345
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,400
I think I see where that laser guy is. 

346
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,000
No! Don't look! Don't look.

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,700
Oh, yeah, that's him. 

348
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,700
OK. I'm gonna sneak up on him.

349
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

350
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,900
We should be able 
to get across right through here!

351
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,700
It's a dead end!

352
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,200
Oh, no! I thought--

353
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,900
You thought? 
We're gonna die in the dark! 

354
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,800
I knew it! I knew it! 
We're gonna die!

355
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Get a hold of yourself!

356
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, come on!

357
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Sorry. Somebody... help us!

358
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,300
¡Mira, mira! ¡Stacy Keach!

359
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,200
We're down here! Help!

360
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,200
There's people down there! 
Hold on!

361
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,900
Let us out. 

362
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,200
There's an unmarried 
pregnant woman down here.

363
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,900
Don't judge me!

364
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,200
Help us up 
so we can cross the street?

365
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,800
Nah, nah, You can't cross here. 
There's a parade.

366
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,800
But we've come so far. 
We just want to unwind.

367
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Hey, what can I tell ya?

368
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
Wanna make out some more?

369
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Oh, God! Let us out!

370
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Got it!

371
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,500
That wasn't a laser pen.

372
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
No. It's just a pen.

373
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,200
Oh, that's funny

374
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
No. You have, 
like, a dot on your face. 

375
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Whoever's doing that is very clever.

376
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,300
Come on, man. 
You need to lighten up. 

377
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
You know, a feeling like this 
only happens once a year.

378
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Yeah, it's like this 
every day in Puerto Rico.

379
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,300
See, now you're 
getting the spirit of it, huh?

380
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Ooh! ¡Dios mío!

381
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,300
Hey! There's a guy 
burning the Puerto Rican flag!

382
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Who! Who is burning the flag?!

383
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,600
Oh, no.

384
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Him?!

385
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,100
That's not very nice.

386
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,400
It was an accident.

387
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,500
Do you know what day this is? 

388
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Because I know what day this is, 
they know what day this is, 

389
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,400
so I was wondering 
if you know what day this is!

390
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Because it's Puerto Rican day.

391
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Maybe we should estomp you 
like you estomp the flag! 

392
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,500
What do you think of that?

393
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Now look, I just have one thing 
to say to you boys. 

394
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Mama!

395
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.

396
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,600
Well, this is a lovely apartment. 

397
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. 

398
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. 

399
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Preferably one with some paint thinner 
and, uh, some rags?

400
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,500
It's down the hall.

401
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,200
Oh, hello...

402
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,300
Art.

403
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Mr. Vandelay, of course.

404
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,500
You two know each other?

405
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,600
Mr. Pennypacker!

406
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,800
Uh, yes, uh, 
I--I wanted to, uh, stop by

407
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,400
and make sure that my 
shark tank fits in--

408
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,700
Uh, hello.

409
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,100
Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay.
And you know Mr. Varnsen.

410
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,900
Uh, Varnsen.

411
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,600
Pennypacker.

412
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,400
Vandelay.

413
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Pennypacker. Varnsen.

414
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,900
Vandelay. 

415
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,600
Wait a second. 

416
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, 
and Mr. Vandelay is also here, 

417
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
then who's watching the factory?

418
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,600
The factory?

419
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,600
The Saab factory?

420
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Jerry, that's in Sweden.

421
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,900
My car!

422
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,500
Well, you know, it's like this 
every day in Puerto Rico.

423
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,900
Jerry, the Mets lost.

424
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,900
I love a parade!

425
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,500
How do you suppose they did that?

426
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,000
Well...

427
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,600
there's no logical explanation. 

428
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
All right. 
Well, shall we go home?

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
Well, what about my car?

430
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.

431
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
Hey, there's Elaine.

432
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Hey.

433
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,300
Well, you look, uh...

434
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,400
relaxed.

435
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Well, it is Sunday night, 
and you know how I like to unwind.

436
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,400
Hey, black Saab. 

437
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,300
Looks like that building cut you off! 

438
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,100
See ya around!

439
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,600
Well, at least he didn't--

440
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Jackass!

441
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,900
Somebody remember where we parked.

442
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,900
This was a fun day. 
It's nice to get out.
