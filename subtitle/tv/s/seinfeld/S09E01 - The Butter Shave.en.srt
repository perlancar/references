1
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:03,784
What is Holland?

2
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:09,753
What do you mean, "what is it"?

3
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:11,743
It's a country right next to Belgium.

4
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:14,560
No, that's the Netherlands.
Holland *is* the Netherlands.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,094
Then who are the Dutch?

6
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:19,682
You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,742
I know, I hate it too.

8
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:23,175
I feel like an out of work
porn star.

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,212
I told you, we should have taken
some kind of vacation.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,628
Well why didn't we?

11
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:31,004
Because you said this would be better.
Remember?

12
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,891
A  vacation from ourselves.
That's what you said.

13
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:36,830
What if we grew muttonchops?
No.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,431
Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!

15
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:40,868
Stop it, George. Stop it.

16
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,124
I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.

17
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:47,148
Dammit.

18
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:54,533
Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?

19
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:57,875
No more crutches,
that must be a relief.

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,588
Yeah, with crutches
everyone has questions.

21
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,795
Not with a cane?

22
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:02,467
Nah, with crutches
it's a funny story,

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,698
with a cane it's a sad story.
You through with those?

24
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:09,239
Always a sad story. Hey, you
should have been here tonight.

25
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:12,248
Some guy from NBC saw my set,
he wants me to do a showcase.

26
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,326
I might have another shot
at a pilot.

27
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:18,279
Alright, we're back in!
We? No.

28
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania.

29
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,274
Thank you, thank you,

30
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:25,006
Hey, Jerry, didja see me up there?

31
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:27,199
I was killing, Jerry.
Killing. I killed.

32
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,469
Killed?
Killed.

33
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,302
I'm gonna go pick
up some chicks.

34
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:35,359
Good looking ones,too!
Hey, what's your name?

35
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:38,646
Killed.

36
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:40,783
Because I killed first
and warmed up the crowd.

37
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:43,390
He's like that fish
that attaches himself to the shark.

38
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:44,749
And you're the shark?

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,818
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's
the fish eating my laughs.

40
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,175
I don't know how
a fish could eat laughs.

41
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,176
Well, I'm glad
I brought it up.

42
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:01,566
Got any shredded coconut?

43
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,449
Uh, we're not doing that anymore.

44
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,537
Yeah, yeah, right.

45
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,688
Oh my god.
What?

46
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:11,849
I got a job interview.
They want to see me this afternoon.

47
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:13,737
So what's this job?

48
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:15,441
Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.

49
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,705
Knicks? Rangers?
Playground equipment.

50
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,585
Welcome back to the show.

51
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,089
Yeah, this is better.

52
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:27,667
So, you got any shredded coconut?
No.

53
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:29,545
I gotta hobble.

54
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:41,184
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving
cream. I'm getting no protection.

55
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:43,414
What kind do you use?
Whatever you get.

56
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,674
Look, postcard from Elaine
from Europe.

57
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,088
Don't tell me she's dragging another
poor guy across Europe.

58
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,502
Remember David Puddy?

59
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:55,165
She's dating him again, huh?

60
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:56,651
Well, I guess she's batted around

61
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,369
and she's back at the top of the order.

62
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:01,040
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine.

63
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:04,520
That guy's coming home in
a body bag.

64
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:13,279
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner,
a five kroner, a twenty kroner.

65
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,559
No wait, that's another ten kroner.

66
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,495
A fimty kroner?
How much is that?

67
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:23,872
We have to break up.
What?

68
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:26,144
I can't take this anymore!

69
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:29,486
I don't want to hear how interesting
the change with the hole in it is!

70
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,862
And if you tell me what time
it is in New York again,

71
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,075
you are going home in a body bag!

72
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:35,594
Well what about you?

73
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,145
What do you think The Gap in Rome
has that's notin The Gap on Broadway?

74
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,800
Okay, alright listen. Forget about

75
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,213
The Gap because we are through!

76
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:43,542
Fine!
Fine!

77
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:46,190
Okay, terminal three.
Have a nice flight.

78
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,712
Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time,

79
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:51,069
with stopovers, will be
approximately 22 hours.

80
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:57,093
Hey, you gonna bust out
that drink cart or what?

81
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,495
Hey, what are you doing?

82
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,414
Oh, I'm taking this lace out.

83
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,190
It came undone and
touched the floor of a

84
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,597
men's room. That's the end of that.

85
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,137
Did you see Bania's set last night?

86
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:13,484
'Cause I read on the Internet
he killed.

87
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:16,154
He killed. He only does well when
he has me for a lead-in.

88
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:17,524
He's a time slot hit.

89
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,418
Well, you gotta give him
some credit.

90
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:25,810
You're just being totally ridiculous.
I'll see you later buddy.

91
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:31,193
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
What?

92
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:33,927
Do I have to ask?

93
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:37,994
I ran out of butter so I had
to borrow yours.

94
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,440
Anything else, Mr. Nosy?

95
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:47,530
Why are you buttering your face?

96
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm shaving with it.

97
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:51,521
Oh Moses smell the roses.

98
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:55,234
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any
commercial shaving cream.

99
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,435
Now feel  my face.
No.

100
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:03,609
Feel it.
I don't want to.

101
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:05,778
Feel it. Feel it.

102
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:08,130
That is close.

103
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:15,370
I got the job?

104
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:26,823
I don't want you to think that

105
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:29,715
anyone's gonna treat you any differently

106
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:31,003
just because of your, uh, handicap.

107
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,888
Handicap?
I'm not handicapped.

108
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,443
I'm sorry. Differently, uh, advantaged.

109
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:40,651
Yeah, I didn't mean that.

110
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:44,098
Of course you will have your own private,
fully equipped bathroom.

111
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:50,343
When do I start?

112
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,171
Whenever you feel
that you're able.

113
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,611
Um, you need a hand here.

114
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:58,834
Yeah, what the hell.

115
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:01,811
You got the job?

116
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:05,067
Jerry, it's fantastic.
I love the people over there.

117
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:07,284
hey treat me sogreat.
You know they think I'm handicapped,

118
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,940
they gave me this incredible
office, a great view.

119
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,562
Hold on, they think
you're handicapped?

120
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,850
Yeah, yeah, well,
because of the cane.

121
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,730
You should see the bathroom
they gave me!

122
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:17,554
How can you do this?

123
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,195
Jerry, let's face it,
I've always been handicapped.

124
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:22,562
I'm just now getting
the recognition for it.

125
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:27,217
Name one thing I have that puts me in a
position of advantage. Huh?

126
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,633
There was a guy that worked
at the Yankees-- no arms!

127
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,167
He got more work done than
I did, made more money,

128
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,113
had a wife, a family, drove
a better car than I did.

129
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,474
He drove a car
with no arms?

130
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:41,269
Alright I made up the part about the car,
but the rest is true.

131
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:44,085
He hated me anyway!

132
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:47,166
Do you know how hard it's getting
just to tell people I know you?

133
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,718
I love that bathroom.
It's got that high, high toilet.

134
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,765
I feel like a gargoyle perched
on the ledge of a building.

135
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:58,381
They hooked me up.
What's with all the butter?

136
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:00,668
I'm shaving with it, and you know
what I discovered?

137
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,229
You can eat it?

138
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:06,044
No, my face feels so good,
I'm gonna use it all over my body.

139
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:12,212
Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
Who?

140
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,207
The tooth brush
in the toilet bowl.

141
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,788
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna.
Pretty good lookin' huh?

142
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:22,821
Jerry's the guy that I dated
right before you.

143
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,012
Oh. This is awkward.

144
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:26,766
Don't worry, Kenny.

145
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:29,573
After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure.

146
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:33,268
I don't believe this.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,787
You miss her, don't you?

148
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,684
No! He's riding my coattails again.

149
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,596
He's getting everything off me,
first laughs now ladies.

150
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:41,852
You miss her.

151
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:48,269
You know I think ultimately,
I'm upset with myself.

152
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:52,349
I knew what I was getting into,
she's a bitter, unstable person.

153
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:54,652
I   mean the sex was good.

154
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:58,148
I'm sure it was fine for her.
I need more.

155
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:02,764
Huh. You believing this?
Excuse me, I was sleeping.

156
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,892
You missed quite a performance.

157
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:09,387
That's my apple juice.

158
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,970
Someone's cooking.

159
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:56,363
Hello, Jerry.
Hello, Newman.

160
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:00,010
You know, old friend,

161
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:05,642
sometimes I ponder this silly gulf
between us and I say, "Why?"

162
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,914
Are we really so different. For what is--

163
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:11,146
I'm not the one doing the cooking,
Newman.

164
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,906
Damn you Seinfeld.
You useless pustule.

165
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:20,123
Um, somebody's got something
on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.

166
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,394
No, he's up on the roof getting
some sun with the butter

167
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,305
Oh no!
Butter?

168
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,347
-Fimty kroner.

169
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:36,065
You know my last boyfriend, he had
a real kroner comprehension problem.

170
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,649
No what I mean?
A real cement head.

171
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,738
David, you are so funny.
Yeah, I know.

172
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:45,850
What are you doing?

173
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,457
It's a long flight, Elaine.
I had to get on with my life.

174
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,881
By making time with some floozy
across the aisle?

175
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:52,105
Yeah, that's right.

176
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,385
Well, what's going on over there with you
and, uh, vegetable lasagna?

177
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,185
This guy? He's an idiot.

178
00:09:58,082 --> 00:09:59,542
I can here you.

179
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:01,931
Well, she doesn't mean
anything to me either.

180
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,780
If it were up to me, we'd
still be together.

181
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:05,779
Well maybe I feel
the same way.

182
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,350
Ok.
Ok, so now what?

183
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:09,365
Let's make out.

184
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:16,067
Kramer!
Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.

185
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:23,550
Look at your skin.
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.

186
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:36,022
I'm fried.
Technically, you're sautéed.

187
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:37,990
So, what are you doing for that?

188
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:40,411
Well, I just gotta keep my skin
moist so I don't dry out.

189
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,587
Is that what the doctor said?

190
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:44,207
No, I read an article in
Bon Appetite magazine.

191
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,255
Hmm. Game hen?

192
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:54,815
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing
your work home with you?

193
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,283
No, I fake limp on my right.

194
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:00,155
This is a real limp because
I sprained my ankle.

195
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:01,433
What happened?

196
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:04,530
Well, I was buttering myself up
for a nice shave

197
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,351
Oh no, not you too?

198
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,576
I must have dripped some
on the floor and I slipped and...

199
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,923
You know what's good for that?
Relish.

200
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:17,182
Hello? Yeah, this is
Jerry Seinfeld.

201
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:24,647
What? No. No! No! No!! No!!!
Thank you.

202
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:27,334
I don't believe this.

203
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,167
They've added Bania to the
network showcase

204
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,743
and he's going on right after me.

205
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,742
So what, he's got
a couple of good jokes.

206
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:36,726
Like what, Ovaltine?
Why do dogs drink out of the toilet?

207
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,433
Shopping carts with
one bad wheel?

208
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,310
That's true, that always happens to me.

209
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,550
You think that's funny?

210
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:47,142
I don't know, I like stuff
you don't have to think about too much.

211
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:50,669
You like Bania's act.
You're a closet Bania fan!

212
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,043
maybe I am.
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

213
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:55,453
Puke! That's a funny word.

214
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:02,301
Puke. puke! Don't have to
think about that.

215
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,822
I can't believe
we broke up like that.

216
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,855
Do you want something to read?
Nah.

217
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:30,629
Well, are you going
to take a nap or

218
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,648
You're just going to sit there
staring at the back of a seat?

219
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,445
Yeah.

220
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,813
That's it! I cannot
take this!

221
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,052
I mean, look at this,
nothing has changed.

222
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:55,070
We're back together two hours,

223
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:57,453
we're having the same problems
we had  12 hours ago.

224
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:59,580
Tell me about it, I don't know
why I ever took you back.

225
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,780
Please! I took you back.

226
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,060
You know it, I know it,
vegetable lasagna here knows it.

227
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:08,316
I don't want to get involved.

228
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:13,707
and we just ram right into it
and end this whole thing!

229
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:18,571
Oh god.
Ow! Ow!!

230
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:28,909
How much longer you gonna be,
I'm starving here.

231
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:32,211
Just a few more squirts.
Cause I gotta stay juicy.

232
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:36,155
The smell. It's still
with you, huh?

233
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,324
Yeah, it's baked on it.

234
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:43,511
Put some butter in.
Stir it up so it melts.

235
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:58,390
Ahh, now I'm simmering.
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.

236
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,118
Good morning, George.

237
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:04,366
Is something wrong
with your other leg

238
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:07,470
Oh, no, that's just the
old handicap acting up.

239
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:10,135
But your cane's on
the wrong side.

240
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:15,302
That's just because we're standing
on opposite sides.

241
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,557
See, when we
met, I was over there a

242
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:23,574
and you were over here so the image
was reversed, like in the mirror.

243
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:27,926
See? This looks right to you,
doesn't it?

244
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:30,463
Uh, yeah, I guess.

245
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:39,986
But, see here.
Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right.

246
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,020
Will you stop it, George?
Just stop it!

247
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:44,419
I think I can see
what's going on here.

248
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:58,515
Well, you're not gonna believe
what happened.

249
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,305
You mugged Stephen Hawking?

250
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:08,544
Play Now thinks I got problems
in both legs.

251
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:12,874
My own personal Rascal,
Jerry. On the house.

252
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:18,960
Well it must be comforting to know

253
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:23,416
you'll be going straight to hell at
no more than three miles an hour.

254
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,235
Hello?
Jerry.

255
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:27,154
Hey, Lainie, how's
the trip going?

256
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:32,235
Awful. This trip was
a *huge* mistake. Huge!

257
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:35,184
Please don't shout.
I can't take it.

258
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,835
Who's that?
It's Vegetable Lasagna.

259
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:39,984
Who?
Vegetable Lasagna!

260
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:42,264
My name is Magnus.

261
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:45,304
Shut up or I'll snap you in half
and stuff you in the overhead!

262
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:47,937
Get me some duty free Kahlua.

263
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:49,472
How's the trip?
Sounded good.

264
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,359
Well. Gotta motor.

265
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:53,509
Hey, if you got any juice left,

266
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,335
you might wanna roll by
the big showcase  tonight.

267
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,939
Ah, you still going on in front of
Bania, eh?

268
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,202
That's right, and I'll tell you what.
I'm feeling a little off.

269
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:05,178
What are you talking about?
You're not!

270
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:07,282
That's right, I'm taking
a dive.

271
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,685
You're throwing the set?

272
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:11,647
I'm laying down! Then let's see
how he does up there,

273
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,347
without all the
assistance.

274
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,932
Listen Jerry.

275
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:20,700
Bania's voice is the voice of
a  new generation. My generation.

276
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,764
We're four months apart.

277
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,226
nevertheless. His time has come.

278
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,124
Now if you will kindly help me
unwedge my front wheel,

279
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:37,652
I'll be on my
way.

280
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:47,293
Butter. Kramer.
Butter. Kramer.

281
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:58,227
Hey buddy.

282
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:04,699
What are you doing?

283
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,803
George tells me you're gonna
throw your set?

284
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:08,506
That's right, Choochie.

285
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,811
Let's see how Bania does
without the cushy timeslot.

286
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,459
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jerry Seinfeld!

287
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:15,883
If you'll excuse me.

288
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:22,268
Hey everybody! Who's ready
to laugh?

289
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,342
What's the deal with lampshades?

290
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:30,187
I mean if it's a lamp, why
do you want
shade?

291
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:36,043
And what's with people
getting sick?

292
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,786
I mean, what's the dea
l with cancer?

293
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:44,826
I have cancer!
Oh, tough crowd.

294
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:52,482
Hey, hey! You dented
my ride.

295
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:58,863
Whatcha got there, the 4 volt?
Heh, I did you a favor.

296
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,801
How about I do you a favor
upside your head?

297
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,194
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah.

298
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,234
Hey!
Get the bikes.

299
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:21,154
Ouch.
You didn't do so bad.

300
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,595
What are you talking about?
I bombed!

301
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:26,307
No, you had some good stuff.
The cancer bit?

302
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,864
It was edgy, it was not my sort of thing
but some of those people out there,

303
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:32,558
they really liked it.
Like who?

304
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:34,534
Like that guy who yelled out.

305
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:36,229
He had cancer!

306
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:38,854
And laughter is the
best medicine.

307
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:44,432
Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania!

308
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,151
Hey, Jerry, he could have used
your laugh.

309
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:52,189
He was a big turkey out
there.

310
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:55,069
Turkey?
A big fat turkey.

311
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,734
I'm sorry I missed that.

312
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:00,342
He worked so hard
and then he just--

313
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:04,294
What is this, oregano?

314
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:11,557
Look at me! I'm all covered
in oregano and Parmesan,

315
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:17,470
and it's sticking to me because
of the butter! Look at me!

316
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:22,453
Here. Hold this.
What is this, parsley?

317
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,776
Ah, the sweet stench
of failure.

318
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:31,023
Get off of me,
get off of me!

319
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:51,996
Now I got you!

320
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,116
George? Your legs!

321
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,484
Are you a religious man, sir?
no.

322
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:11,699
Eat hickory!!

323
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,316
Hey Jerry, didja see it?
Ouch.

324
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:23,883
Kenny! There you are.
Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC.

325
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:26,880
Listen, Kenny.
Really funny out there.

326
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,146
What?

327
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,381
That thing you did having
the two guys running through?

328
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:32,912
I love stuff you don't have
to think too much about

329
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,262
Give us a call. We want to be
in the Kenny Bania business.

330
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:40,103
By the way, Jerry? The suspenders?
A little hacky.

331
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:44,287
How about that Jerry?

332
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,463
First you had a pilot on NBC
and now I'll have one.

333
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:48,502
Looks like I'm following
you again.

334
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,608
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

335
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:53,766
Puke? That's a funny word.
Can I use that?

336
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,984
David, this has been the worst
month of my life

337
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:08,115
and if I never see you
again it'll be too soon.

338
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:10,209
Ditto.
Oh that's origi-

339
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:11,345
Shut up.

340
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:16,720
86th and Broadway please.

341
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:19,245
I'm sorry lady, there's a
cab shortage.

342
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:21,321
The Transit Police are
making everybody share.

343
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:25,601
Oh no.

344
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:30,435
Hello! Oh no. I'm sorry.

345
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:35,537
Noooooooooooo!
