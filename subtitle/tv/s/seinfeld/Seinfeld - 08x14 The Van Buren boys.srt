1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,065
-The last president to have a beard?
-Nixon.

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,074
-No, I mean a real thick beard.
-His was thick.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,509
No, I mean like a full, long beard,
like Smith Brothers Cough Drops.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,670
Falkmore.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,682
-Who?
-Artemis N. Falkmore.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,479
-You made that up, right?
-Yeah.

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,587
-But it sounds like a president name?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,417
Why do presidents all
have bad names?

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,024
Woodrow, Grover, Millard.

10
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,285
The presidency attracts
the badly named.

11
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,520
Their ambition is based on
personal insecurity.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,392
It's classic male overcompensation.

13
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,363
Are you wearing lifts
in those shoes?

14
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,996
Cab.

15
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,703
So they have this clock now,
where you punch in your age...

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,710
...and all your risk factors...

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,044
...and it actually counts down
how much time you have left to live.

18
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,151
What's the great moment?
On your deathbed.

19
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,948
They're pounding on your chest,
and you're going: "Ten, nine, eight--

20
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,057
I told you this thing was good."

21
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,960
-I can't believe this is our first date.
-I know. Dessert?

22
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,461
I suppose I have to get
a piece of cake.

23
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,726
-Why?
-Today is my birthday.

24
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,767
What? Today?

25
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,097
-Really?
-Yep.

26
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,410
So she went out with you
on a first date and it was her birthday?

27
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,919
Yeah, and she picked the day.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,614
Is she socially...

29
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,190
...awkward?

30
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,587
No, she's great.

31
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,821
-She's attractive and fun.
-Well, maybe she decided...

32
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,693
...to celebrate her birthday on
the Monday after the weekend.

33
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,301
She's not Lincoln.

34
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,402
Hey.

35
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,632
Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?

36
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,775
-I'll pass.
-Oh, really?

37
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,912
Hey, George. Pizza.

38
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,240
I can't. I gotta go down
to the foundation.

39
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,374
I'm interviewing high schoolers
for the Susan Ross Scholarship.

40
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,216
Does it ever bother you
that this organization...

41
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,946
-Nope.
-...is beating the bushes...

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,184
-No.
-...to basically give this money away...

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,055
-No.
-...to virtually anyone...

44
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,026
...as long as they're not you?

45
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,562
I'm fine with it.

46
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,632
Fine, I say.

47
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,467
And then I received a 740
on the English Achievement Test.

48
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,700
Quick, what's your favorite animal?

49
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,746
I don't know. Frog?

50
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,876
Frog?

51
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,350
-Well, l--
-Frog is wrong.

52
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,249
I see here that you play the harp.

53
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,687
Tell me, why do they have to tilt it?

54
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,129
Can't they just build it on an angle?

55
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,924
Save you a lot of trouble.

56
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,227
Well, the modern-day harp has been
refined over thousands of years...

57
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,633
-...back to--
-Yeah, yeah, we'll let you know.

58
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,003
I see your GPA is 4.0.

59
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,839
You like that, don't you?

60
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,680
So, Steven, I see you're
president of the chess club.

61
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,114
State champs.

62
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,519
Who's your favorite chess player?

63
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,758
Nastercoff?

64
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,456
Right.

65
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,363
Nastercoff.

66
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,899
What country is he from again?

67
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,076
I don't know.

68
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,908
I made it up.

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,904
I'm never gonna get this thing.

70
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,850
What are you telling me for?

71
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,248
You really had me going there.

72
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,719
Come on, sit down.

73
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,955
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

74
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,395
Well, I've been telling people
that I'd like to be an architect.

75
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,399
So get this, Mr. Peterman is finally
letting me do some real writing.

76
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,804
He's got this book deal
for his autobiography.

77
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,604
He's gonna let me ghostwrite it.

78
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,473
Wow, that's great.
When it comes out...

79
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,138
...I'll have to get someone
to ghost-read it.

80
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,544
-Hey. Oh, hi.
-Hey.

81
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,583
-Hey.
-So there I am at Lorenzo's...

82
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,280
...Ioading up my slice
at the fixings bar.

83
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,255
Garlic and whatnot.

84
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,985
When I see this guy over at
the pizza boxes...

85
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,528
...giving me the stink eye.

86
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,730
So I give him the crook eye back,
you know?

87
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,703
And I notice that he's not alone.

88
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,934
I'm taking on
the entire Van Buren Boys.

89
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,408
-Van Buren Boys?
-Yeah.

90
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,446
There's a street gang named after
President Martin Van Buren?

91
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,413
Oh, yeah, and they're
just as mean as he was.

92
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,780
So I make a move to
the door, you know?

93
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,182
They block it.

94
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,586
So I lunge for the bathroom.
I grab the knob.

95
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,420
Occupied.

96
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,365
Then they back me up
against the cartoon map of ltaly...

97
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,559
...and all of a sudden they just stop.

98
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,169
What? What happened?

99
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,830
Because I'm still holding
the garlic shaker, like this:

100
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,532
I'm only showing eight fingers.

101
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,111
-Well, what does that mean?
-That's their secret sign.

102
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,243
See, Van Buren, he was
the eighth president.

103
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,387
They thought I was
a former Van B Boy.

104
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,821
-How was the pizza?
-lt was a little oily.

105
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,559
Jerry, can you hold on a sec?
I just wanna check my messages.

106
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,495
Oh, Melissa, Kim.

107
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,570
-Ellen.
-Hey. I want you to meet Jerry.

108
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,997
Oh, we've heard a lot about you.

109
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,738
It is so sweet of you to take her out.

110
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,107
Yeah, you don't even know
how much she needs this.

111
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,873
Is she coming off a bad breakup?

112
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,277
No.

113
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,975
See you.

114
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,285
-Get your messages?
-Yeah. No one called.

115
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,924
They acted like it was some
act of charity, going out with her.

116
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,032
So she's the loser of the group.

117
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,465
Every group has someone
that they all make fun of.

118
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,900
Like us with Elaine.

119
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,435
There's no way Ellen
is the loser of that group.

120
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,446
Are you looking deep down
at the real person underneath?

121
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,710
No, I'm being as superficial
as I possibly can.

122
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,320
-Well, stick with it.
-Yeah.

123
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,822
-I found someone for the scholarship.
-Yeah?

124
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,291
I'm interviewing all these
annoying little overachievers...

125
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,989
...and finally this kid walks in,
Steven Koren, a regular guy.

126
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,225
Likes sports, watches TV.

127
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,838
-ls he smart?
-He knows how to read.

128
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:51,240
And he also knows that finishing
an entire book doesn't prove anything.

129
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,742
But get this:

130
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,402
He's into architecture.

131
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,140
Hey, just like you pretend to be.

132
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,576
Yes, with a little guidance...

133
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,121
...Steven Koren is going to be
everything I claim to be, only for real.

134
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,293
That's my dream, Jerry.

135
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,921
I had a dream last night
that a hamburger was eating me.

136
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,835
Mr. Peterman, thanks
for having me over. I--

137
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,638
Your place isn't quite
what I imagined.

138
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,111
Oh, it's just a place to flop.

139
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,946
Well, what part of your life
do you want to start with?

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,782
Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?

141
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,016
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that
in the catalog, ad nauseam.

142
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,458
No, I would like this book
to be about my day-to-day life.

143
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,597
Oh, damn, they changed
the cable stations again...

144
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,361
...just when I finally
memorized them.

145
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,669
-Well, Mr. Peterman, do you want to--?
-Two: CBS.

146
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,308
-Get started?
-Three....

147
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,842
I don't know what that is.

148
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,180
Where's my damn
preview channel?

149
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,610
Well, I gotta tell you, Mr. Peterman...

150
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,516
...I don't know if I see
a whole book here.

151
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,647
Well, I'm sure we'll
come up with something.

152
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,555
What do you say you and l
order ourselves a pie?

153
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,195
Do you like Lorenzo's?

154
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,730
A friend of mine almost got beat up
at that place by the Van Buren Boys.

155
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,164
-You don't say?
-Yeah.

156
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,861
The only thing that saved
him is...

157
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,268
...he accidentally flashed
their secret gang sign.

158
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,369
-Well, that's pretty exciting.
-Yeah.

159
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,602
Let's put that in the book.

160
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,671
But that didn't happen to you.

161
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,842
Well, so we pay off your friend,
and it becomes a Peterman.

162
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,549
No, I really don't think
you can do that.

163
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:49,627
Oh, damn, I forgot to buy
plant food again.

164
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,156
I'll bet I got a coupon for it.

165
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,392
You know what?
Maybe I better talk to my friend.

166
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,136
Is that the same outfit
you were wearing yesterday?

167
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,711
No, this is brand-new.
Do you like it?

168
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,438
Actually, yeah.

169
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,921
Wait a second.
Is that the fork that fell on the floor?

170
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,546
Are you using the fork
that fell on the floor?

171
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,250
No, Jerry, the waitress
gave me another one.

172
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,794
I guess that's all right.

173
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:29,867
-ls something wrong, Jerry?
-No, absolutely nothing.

174
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,131
You're fantastic.

175
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,569
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

176
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,674
Kramer, George, this is Ellen.

177
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,612
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to introduce you...

178
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,777
...to the first Susan Ross Scholar.

179
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,115
This...

180
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,916
...is Steven Koren.

181
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,756
His GPA is a solid 2.0.

182
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,559
Right in that meaty part
of the curve.

183
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,429
Not showing off, not falling behind.

184
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,867
George, the qualifications
for this scholarship...

185
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,472
...were supposed to be
largely academic.

186
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,699
I'm sure we're all aware
of the flaws...

187
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,037
...and biases of standardized tests.

188
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,306
These aren't standardized tests.
These are his grades.

189
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,179
Besides, Steven Koren has
the highest of aspirations.

190
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,548
He wants to be...

191
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,716
...an architect.

192
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,118
Is that right?

193
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,284
Actually, maybe I could set
my sights a little bit higher.

194
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,125
Steven, nothing is higher
than architect.

195
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,166
I think I'd really like to be
a city planner.

196
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,498
Why limit myself to one building
when I can design a whole city?

197
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,640
-Well, that's a good point.
-No, it's not.

198
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,934
Isn't an architect just
an art school dropout...

199
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,135
...with a tilting desk and a big ruler?

200
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,576
It's called a T-square.

201
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,348
You know, the stupidest guy
in my fraternity became an architect...

202
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,543
...after he flunked
out of dental school.

203
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,855
Congratulations, young man.

204
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,218
Susan would be very proud
of what you're doing.

205
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,826
Thank you.

206
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,725
And they made it their sign because
Van Buren, our eighth president...

207
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,833
...was the man they most admired.

208
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,428
Kramer, my friend,
that is one ripping good yarn.

209
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,609
You know, if you liked that one,
I got more.

210
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,607
What are you looking for?

211
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,545
Romance? Comedy? Adventure?

212
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,582
Erotica?

213
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,514
No, Kramer, I don't think--

214
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,657
How much would you take
for the whole lot?

215
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,885
-My whole life?
-Name your price, man.

216
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,191
$1 500.

217
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,722
-I'll give you half that.
-Done.

218
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,461
Kramer, my friend, you consider
Elaine at your disposal.

219
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,766
Okay.

220
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,236
Well, l....

221
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,967
I like to work in the evenings.

222
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,210
Would you please just get on
with the stupid Bob Sacamano story?

223
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,482
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob,
and I realize right then and there...

224
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,719
...that I need to return this pair
of pants. So I'm off to the store.

225
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,487
What happened to Bob Sacamano?

226
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,256
Well, nothing. His part
of the story is done.

227
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,670
I'm waiting for the subway.
It's not coming.

228
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,635
I decided to hoof it
through the tunnel.

229
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,239
Well, now, that's something.

230
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,501
I don't know
if I lost track of time or what.

231
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,111
-The next thing I knew--
-A train is bearing down on you?

232
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,611
No, I slipped and fell in mud...

233
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:34,014
...ruining the very pants
I was about to return.

234
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,686
I don't understand.

235
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,088
You were wearing the pants
you were returning?

236
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,786
Well, I guess I was.

237
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,263
What were you gonna
wear on the way back?

238
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,430
Elaine, are you listening?

239
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,968
I didn't even get there.

240
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,374
-All right. Next story.
-I think I've got enough for one day.

241
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,340
-Yeah, chew on that.
-I'll chew on that.

242
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,572
Hey, listen. By the way, I'm hosting
a little get-together tonight...

243
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,978
...in honor of my little
financial upturn.

244
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,142
Oh, thanks, I've got plans.

245
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,685
Yeah, Elaine, you should be there
to document it.

246
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,791
Oh, you're getting together with
some of your jackass friends?

247
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,484
-You want me to take notes?
-Yeah, but get there after 9.

248
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,688
You know, give the people
a chance to loosen up.

249
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,571
So you're denying him the scholarship
because he wants to be a planner?

250
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,141
I was betrayed.

251
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,640
That kid was like a son to me.

252
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,283
If there's one person
you should be able to hold down...

253
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,213
...it's your own flesh and blood.

254
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,583
Like my father
and my father's father before him.

255
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,989
You know, maybe philanthropy
is not your field.

256
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,494
Hello. Oh, hi, Ellen.
Yeah, I called the hotel.

257
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,360
-We're set for the weekend.
-Spending the weekend with Ellen?

258
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,497
Vermont.

259
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,533
You know, we can stay
an extra couple of days if we want.

260
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,435
Four days at a beautiful
bed-and-breakfast.

261
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,939
I can't wait.

262
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,871
Bye-bye.

263
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,114
What?

264
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,647
What is this?

265
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,250
-You wanna start?
-No, no, no. You go ahead.

266
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,553
I gotta get my thoughts together.

267
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:28,456
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation
has gone far enough.

268
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,895
-What?
-Jerry, she's a loser.

269
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,969
Where is this coming from?
She's great.

270
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,233
Why are you doing this, Jerry?

271
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,537
Is it your career?
Things are gonna pick up.

272
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,210
There's nothing wrong
with my career.

273
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,249
I like the Bloomingdale's
executive training program for him.

274
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,976
We weren't gonna
discuss that now.

275
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,054
-It's something he should consider.
-Of course he should.

276
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,283
-But now is not the time.
-Listen, these issues are interrelated.

277
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,122
All right. Excuse me.

278
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,888
I'm not buying
any of this.

279
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,158
So, what are you saying? That we're
wrong? Everybody's wrong but you.

280
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,026
This is like that Twilight Zone
where the guy wakes up...

281
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,672
...and he's the same,
and everybody else is different.

282
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,841
-Which one?
-They were all like that.

283
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,848
Why did you take away
my scholarship, Mr. Costanza?

284
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,609
Well, Steven, l....

285
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,680
These are my new friends...

286
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,224
...the Van Buren Boys.

287
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,693
He became so disillusioned,
he had to join us.

288
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,895
-Nice.
-I want my scholarship back...

289
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,694
...so I can be a city planner.

290
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,829
What about architect, Steven?

291
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,031
City planner.

292
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,181
-Great party, K-Man.
-You got that straight.

293
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:55,150
Elaine, try the beef, because that's
real au jus sauce. Real au jus sauce.

294
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,755
-I'll make a note of it.
-Hey, Kramer.

295
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,221
-Yeah.
-Ramirez has never heard your story.

296
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,654
Oh, okay.

297
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,658
Well, I had Bob Sacamano
on the phone...

298
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,525
-...and I suddenly realized that l--
-Hey, Kramer, Kramer.

299
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,496
You can't tell that story now.

300
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,964
It belongs to Peterman.

301
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,604
-What do you mean?
-You signed the release.

302
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,569
-Yeah.
-He sat in mud, not you.

303
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,077
-But I did sit in mud.
-You didn't.

304
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,803
You never sat in mud.

305
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,710
I was all dirty.

306
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,750
-lt never happened, you understand?
-Come on.

307
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,917
-Hey, all right. Yeah.
-Finish the story?

308
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,286
Oh, yeah, well, l--
Yeah, the pants-- They--

309
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,226
They-- They fit well and so I decided
I wasn't gonna return them.

310
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,325
-Getting late. We better get going.
-Okay.

311
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,061
You're gonna go now?

312
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,701
Hey, whoa. Come--

313
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,405
I don't--

314
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,677
Kramer, Kramer, I got big trouble
with the Van Buren Boys.

315
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,906
-They're tough cookies.
-I heard that you...

316
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,947
...got on their good side.
What did you do?

317
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,415
Oh, nothing, nothing.

318
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,786
No, I certainly don't have any stories
if that's what you're implying.

319
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,787
You know what those guys
are gonna do?

320
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,185
Yeah, well, you didn't hear it
from me...

321
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,697
...but the Van Buren Boys,
they never hassle their own kind.

322
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,401
You mean, like a former member?

323
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,974
These Kramer stories are unusable.

324
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,271
I mean, some of them
aren't even stories.

325
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,983
Look, this is the list
of things in his apartment.

326
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,053
Is my toaster oven on there?

327
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,417
How am I ever gonna
turn this into a book?

328
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,085
Well, just shape them, change them.
You're a writer.

329
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,358
Yes...

330
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,331
...I'm a writer.

331
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,159
Make them interesting.

332
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,162
Interesting.

333
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,907
Of course.

334
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,407
People love
interesting writing.

335
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,578
Well, I gotta go to the airport.
I'm picking up my parents.

336
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,149
What? Weren't they just here?

337
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,684
Yeah, I'm flying them in
to meet Ellen.

338
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,287
I don't know where to turn.

339
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,516
-I gotta see what they think of her.
-Maybe we can have dinner later.

340
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,253
I don't think so. I'm gonna try
to get them to fly right back tonight.

341
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,359
Oh, hey. Hey, have I told you
about my bunions?

342
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,999
You're going to love
this story.

343
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,861
So I line up my cold cuts
on the couch next to me...

344
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,097
...but as I'm stacking them up
they keep falling into my footbath.

345
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,002
Kramer, this is awful.

346
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,665
We don't wanna hear about this.

347
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,678
-Damn.
-What?

348
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,211
Oh, I bought a bunch
of bunion stories from Newman.

349
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,247
But they all stink.

350
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,985
-How much did you pay for them?
-Eight bucks.

351
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,917
I think I'm getting ripped off.

352
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,152
Newman!

353
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,894
Well, what didn't you like
about the first chapter?

354
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,965
Well, it started out nicely.

355
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,796
I'm returning some pants...

356
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,803
...a very identifiable problem.

357
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,538
I set off down a train tunnel.

358
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,507
Now, that's where the story takes
a most unappealing turn.

359
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,839
Oh, no, no, that's where
it gets interesting.

360
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,040
Don't you see? The train
is bearing down on you...

361
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,708
...you dive into a side tunnel...

362
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:19,221
...and you run into a whole band
of underground tunnel dwellers.

363
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,456
It just seems so clichéd
and obvious.

364
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,425
It's not interesting writing.

365
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,165
Yeah, yeah, I know.

366
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:33,698
How about if instead
of diving from the train, you...?

367
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,710
I don't know. You slip
and fall in some mud...

368
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,242
...and ruin your pants?

369
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,117
The very pants I was returning.

370
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,683
That's perfect irony.
Elaine, that is interesting writing.

371
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,526
I have a Cosmo Kramer on line four.

372
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,625
-Peterman here.
-Mr. Peterson...

373
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,530
...you gotta sell me
my stories back.

374
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,866
You wanna know something?
I no longer need them.

375
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,203
No, no, no, Mr. Peterman, why
don't we keep them as a reference.

376
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,841
Nonsense.

377
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,845
I have Benes' wonderfully
imaginative mind to spin my stories.

378
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,142
You take back your tales,
you vagabond.

379
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,120
There you are, Elaine.
Go forth and create.

380
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,258
And by the way, when you get to that
chapter about romantic escapades...

381
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,894
...feel free to toss yourself
into the mix.

382
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,663
Hey, Van B Boys.

383
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,427
So, Mr. Costanza,
did you get my scholarship back?

384
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,870
Now, fellas, fellas, easy.

385
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,066
Wouldn't wanna beat up
on one of your own.

386
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,710
Is that right?

387
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:50,177
Then why don't you
flash us the sign?

388
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,974
Right.

389
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,915
The sign.

390
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,025
That's not the sign.

391
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,330
It was when I was banging.

392
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,025
All right...

393
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,067
...if you are really one of us...

394
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:16,037
...Iet's see you take the wallet
off the next guy who walks by.

395
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,675
Love to.

396
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,047
And after college I got my
master's at the Sorbonne.

397
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,948
Sorbonne.
Oh, hey, that's in Paris.

398
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,112
Jerry, your parking meter
is about to expire.

399
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,053
Don't get up.
I've got change.

400
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,392
-So, what do you think?
-Jerry, she is fantastic.

401
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,726
I knew it. I'm not crazy.

402
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,129
She's so sweet.

403
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,134
And she's got some body on her.

404
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,865
And smart, like a computer.

405
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,037
And so much personality.
But it doesn't matter what we think.

406
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,509
Do you like her?

407
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,750
Now I'm not so sure.

408
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,819
She's 1 0 times better than that
awful Amber girl that you were with.

409
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,755
Yeah, Amber.
I wonder if she's back from Vegas.

410
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,395
All right, no more stalling.

411
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,090
Next one or you're meat.

412
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,792
All right. All right.

413
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,566
-Seinfelds.
-Hey, George.

414
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:24,970
You gotta do me a favor.

415
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,475
Give me your wallet.
I'll give it back to you later.

416
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,874
How are your folks?

417
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,513
Trying to pick out a new couch.
You don't wanna know.

418
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,744
Give me your wallet or I'll spill
your guts right here on the street.

419
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,611
What did you say?

420
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,313
Come on, hurry up, old man.

421
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,856
I'm an animal.

422
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,017
You're being very rude.
Come on, Morty.

423
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,686
-Please, they're gonna hit me.
-What?

424
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,732
George Costanza,
what is the matter with you?

425
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,128
Tell your parents we said hi.
