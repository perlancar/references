1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,245
All right, what am I
supposed to do here?

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,455
Should I go over there?

3
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,421
It's not like somebody died.
It's Beaches, for God's sake.

4
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,190
If she was sitting next to me,
I'd put my arm around her.

5
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,198
I can't see making a big move
like going all the way over there.

6
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,894
I can't.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,697
I won't.

8
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:48,404
So she calls me this morning, tells me
she's upset that I didn't console her.

9
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,106
I mean, it was Beaches,
for God's sake.

10
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,883
I mean, what do you do
in a situation like that?

11
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,146
- Where were you?
- I was sitting on the chair.

12
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,951
She was over here on the couch.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,552
Well, if you were sitting next to her,
you'd have to console her.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,992
Of course.

15
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,396
But when you're talking about
a movie like Beaches...

16
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,469
...moving from the chair
to the couch...

17
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,629
...that's quite a voyage.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,337
Hey. Hey, we gotta
get going, come on.

19
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,272
- Where are you going?
- Show League game.

20
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,936
The Improv is playing
Rochelle, Rochelle: The Musical.

21
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,411
Really?

22
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,675
Is Bette Midler playing?
Is she gonna be there?

23
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,012
She might be.
She's the star of the show.

24
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,452
Bette Midler is gonna be
in the park today?

25
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,587
Jerry, don't tease me.

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,422
I didn't know you were such a fan.

27
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,429
So maybe I'll go down there
and watch. She'll be there, maybe?

28
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,261
- So is Gennice playing today?
- Yeah, she might be.

29
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,495
- What Gennice?
- That's the understudy. I'm dating her.

30
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,506
- Is this Bette Midler's understudy?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,245
Understudies, now,
they're a shifty bunch.

32
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,213
The substitute teachers
of the theater world.

33
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,317
I'm glad that she's an understudy.

34
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,182
I avoid having to go backstage
and think of something to say.

35
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,220
Going backstage is the worst.

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,950
Especially when they stink.
Then it's a real problem.

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,493
Just once I'd like
to tell someone they stink.

38
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,428
"Hey, you know what,
I didn't like the show, I didn't like you.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,795
You just really stunk.

40
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,234
The whole thing, real bad.
Stinkaroo.

41
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,930
Thanks for the tickets, though."

42
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,576
- Ms. Elaine, you late.
- I know, I know.

43
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,546
I didn't have change for the bus.
Nobody will give you change.

44
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,083
So they threw me off the bus.

45
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,882
But you have to wait
for Lotus now.

46
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,823
Well, how long is that gonna take?
I have, like, a million things to do.

47
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,333
What?

48
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,667
Not long.

49
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,019
What is so funny?

50
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,286
Sunny tell a knock-knock joke.

51
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,695
I'm telling you, I have a sneaking
suspicion they're talking about me.

52
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,902
I think they've been
calling me a dog.

53
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,939
How would you know?
You don't speak Korean.

54
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,134
Because this woman
came in with a dog...

55
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,940
...and Ruby calls the dog
the same word they were saying...

56
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,638
...when they were pointing at me.

57
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,318
You know, maybe in Korean,
"dog" isn't an insult.

58
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,512
It could be like the word "fox" to us.

59
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,056
"Oh, she's a dog!"

60
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,053
Why don't you go to
another nail shop?

61
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,788
Because they're the best, Jerry.
The best. Look.

62
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,431
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

63
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,131
What you need is a translator
to go in with you...

64
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,893
...and tell you what they're saying.

65
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,834
- Yeah, who speaks Korean?
- Do you know who speaks Korean?

66
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,270
- Who?
- George's father.

67
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,605
Oh, God, you've gotta be kidding me.
How does he speak Korean?

68
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,076
- He used to go there on business.
- What did he do?

69
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,306
Sold religious articles.

70
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,178
Statues of Jesus, the Virgin Mary,
manufactured in Korea.

71
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,687
George, does your father
speak Korean?

72
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,321
- Yeah, fluently.
- Really?

73
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,084
In fact, he once spoke to
the Reverend Sun Myung Moon.

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,223
Thanks.

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,423
- Oh, hi, Gennice.
- Hey, Jerry.

76
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,030
You know George.
This is Kramer.

77
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,167
Nice to meet you.

78
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:33,902
- Playing today?
- No. I'm a bench player.

79
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,799
Boy, they really stick
to that understudy rule.

80
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,005
- So she's coming?
- Oh, yeah, she'll be here.

81
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,411
Guaranteed.

82
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,518
Oh, no.

83
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,549
My frankfurter.

84
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,391
My frankfurter fell. Oh, no.

85
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,001
It was really good.
I can't believe that I dropped it.

86
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,939
It's okay. It's just a hot dog.

87
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,911
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

88
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,550
It was really good.

89
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,276
It's Bette!

90
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,551
Hi. Hi.

91
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,390
Look, there she is.
It's Bette. It's Bette.

92
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,092
Bette?

93
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

94
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,539
You know, I just wanna say
I think you're wonderful.

95
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,008
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,613
You know, I've seen you
in everything you've done.

97
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,806
- Really?
- Anything I can get you? A water?

98
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,747
- They got Italian ice over here.
- What flavors do they have?

99
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,354
Well, they've got chocolate,
lemon and cherry.

100
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,922
- How about pineapple?
- Sure. I'll be right back.

101
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,821
Thanks.

102
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,220
- One pineapple.
- No pineapple.

103
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,695
Just cherry, lemon and tutti-frutti.

104
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,402
All right.

105
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,067
Anyway, Mr. Costanza,
what I want you to do...

106
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,210
...is to go into the shop with me
and tell me what they're saying.

107
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,868
You do speak Korean?

108
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,977
I once talked to
the Reverend Sun Myung Moon.

109
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,810
He bought two
Jesus statues from me.

110
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,849
He's a hell of a nice guy.

111
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,384
You ever seen that face on him?

112
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,756
It was like a big apple pie.

113
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,719
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,188
Listen, Mr. Costanza,
if you do this for me...

115
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,492
...I can get you a manicure.
I'll pay for it.

116
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,992
Or you can get
a pedicure if you want.

117
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,895
No one's touching my feet.

118
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:52,033
Between you and me, Elaine,
I think I got a foot-odor problem.

119
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,453
- Hold it up. Time.
- Time.

120
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,228
- How you feeling?
- Pretty good.

121
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,194
Your arm feeling okay?

122
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,194
What's your problem?

123
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,200
Now, listen, she's all over
the inside of the plate.

124
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:22,364
You know, she thinks she's a big star,
thinks she owns the inside corner.

125
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,602
I say we back her off with a little
chin music, you know I what mean?

126
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,111
I know what you mean. Why don't you
go back and play your position there.

127
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,271
Just trying to help.

128
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,248
I know what you're trying to do.
You're throwing off my rhythm.

129
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,081
Go get her.

130
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,624
Caught that, what is it, Beaches,
on cable last night.

131
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,459
"Wind Beneath My Wings," huh?

132
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,032
Give me a break.

133
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,670
Hey, get some talent,
then you can mouth off.

134
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,066
- Strike three.
- What, are you blind?

135
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,998
You stink.

136
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,737
- What's that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

137
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,653
I had an affair with a Korean woman.

138
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,156
Mr. Costanza, I don't...

139
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,063
No, I feel I need to unburden myself.

140
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,896
I loved her very deeply...

141
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,472
...but the clash of cultures
was too much.

142
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,508
- Her family would not accept me.
- Mr. Costanza, I'm not sure...

143
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,373
Maybe it was because I refused
to take off my shoes.

144
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,311
Again, the foot-odor problem.

145
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,075
The father would
look at me and say:

146
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,990
Which means, "This guy...

147
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,895
...this is not my kind of guy."

148
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,995
- Pineapple? Sure, I got pineapple.
- Yeah, all right, okay.

149
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,634
Move in.
Move in, everybody.

150
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,938
Get your shrimp here.

151
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,106
Bigmouth shrimp on special today.

152
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,914
Come on, George,
we just need one run.

153
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,522
Come on, George!

154
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,723
I got the pineapple!
I got the pineapple!

155
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,436
Keep going! All the way!

156
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,972
- Come on, come on!
- Keep going. Run, run!

157
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,138
- Safe.
- Yes!

158
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,110
Yes!

159
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,782
Oh, my God, Bette's hurt!

160
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,321
The understudy's boyfriend
probably put him up to it.

161
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,419
That's his friend.
You're gonna pay for this.

162
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,927
Fellas, fellas, that was a clean play.
Come on, it's just a game.

163
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,189
It's just a game!

164
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,365
Oh, God!

165
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,133
Now, don't worry. I'm with you.

166
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,898
Kramer's here. Kramer is going
to take care of everything.

167
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,907
Here, see? I got your pineapple.

168
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,773
And I saw Beaches last night
for the fourth time.

169
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,057
Our top story:

170
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,199
The show will go on,
but not Bette Midler.

171
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,234
While playing softball in the park,
Ms. Midler was injured...

172
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,861
...when another player thoughtlessly
rammed her at home plate...

173
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,770
...all captured
on amateur videotape.

174
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,604
She'll be out for at least a week...

175
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,714
...from her new Broadway show,
Rochelle, Rochelle: The Musical.

176
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,389
Thank you.

177
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,494
- Well, we...
- No, please.

178
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,191
This is the first time in my life...

179
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,794
...that anyone has ever done
anything like this for me.

180
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,400
I've always had to struggle so hard
for everything I ever got.

181
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,308
And for you two to do
what you did...

182
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,781
...I just know this is
gonna be my big break.

183
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,894
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

184
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,523
Jerry.

185
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,693
Come on, Jerry, open up.
I know you're in there!

186
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,168
Kramer, come back another time.

187
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,006
Yeah.

188
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,148
So you're all in here together.

189
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,876
Well, how convenient.

190
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,390
I hope you're all
very proud of yourselves.

191
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:10,086
So, my dear, you think
you can get to Broadway.

192
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,752
Well, let me tell you something:

193
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,525
Broadway has no room
for people like you.

194
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,190
Not the Broadway I know.

195
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,930
My Broadway takes people like you
and eats them up and spits them out.

196
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,703
My Broadway is the Broadway of
Merman and Martin and Fontanne.

197
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,869
And if you think you can
build yourself up...

198
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,040
...by knocking other people down,
good luck!

199
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,185
Hello, everyone. Hi.

200
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,725
This is my friend Frank.

201
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,462
What would you like today?
Manicure? Pedicure?

202
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,095
I'll take a manicure.

203
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,964
- I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
- Yeah, I know.

204
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,963
What's that?

205
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,011
What'd they say?

206
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,206
They made a derogatory
comment about me.

207
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,361
- Okay, that's it.
- What?

208
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,839
Where's my tail?

209
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,838
I heard every word you said.

210
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,567
You got some nerve!

211
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,006
That voice.

212
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,647
It sounds so familiar.

213
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,984
It reminds me of when
I was a young girl in Korea...

214
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,421
...and I met
an American businessman.

215
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,029
He was a very unusual man.

216
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:56,499
Quick-tempered, with a strange,
halting way of speaking.

217
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,001
We fell in love.

218
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,297
But when I brought him home
to meet my father...

219
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:06,240
...he refused to take his shoes off,
and there was a terrible fight.

220
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,240
This man also refuses
to take his shoes off.

221
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,445
I've never seen people
treated like this!

222
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,523
So you brought in a spy?

223
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,425
Now, take your dry,
bitten nails and get out!

224
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,807
Frank?

225
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,371
Kim?

226
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,382
Yeah, right. It's a turkey sandwich,
a side of slaw.

227
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,415
- You want white or dark meat?
- White meat.

228
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,450
Yeah, white meat.

229
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,955
And if I see one piece of dark meat
on there, it's your ass, buster.

230
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,252
Oh, get me one of those
black-and-white cookies.

231
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,019
All right, yeah.

232
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,291
They don't have any,
but don't worry.

233
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,898
I'm gonna get you one somewhere.

234
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,193
Good. If I don't get a
black-and-white cookie...

235
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,429
...I'm not gonna be
very pleasant to be around.

236
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,900
Now, that's impossible.

237
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,511
- Is there anything else I can do?
- I don't think so.

238
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,511
Well, can I do that for you?

239
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,445
All right, what the hell.

240
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,288
So, what's the scoop on Bob Barker?

241
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,017
Does he really give a damn
about what those things cost...

242
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,626
...or is he just acting?

243
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,361
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I don't even know where I'm going.

244
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,901
Well, that's the best way to get
someplace you've never been.

245
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,774
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

246
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,468
Have you been crying?

247
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,609
Yeah, see, this woman,
this manicurist...

248
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,513
No, no, it doesn't matter why.
That's a very nice jacket.

249
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,381
Oh, thanks.

250
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,682
Very soft. Huge button flaps...

251
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,052
...cargo pockets, drawstring waist...

252
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:05,856
...deep bi-swing vents in the back,
perfect for jumping into a gondola.

253
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,694
How do you know all that?

254
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,165
That's my coat.

255
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,362
- You mean...?
- Yes.

256
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,029
I'm J. Peterman.

257
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,503
I don't know why I have to go.
I didn't do anything to Bette.

258
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,978
Could you stop over here?
We're picking somebody up.

259
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,140
It's that understudy
who put the hit on Bette!

260
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,583
Hey, I didn't do anything.
I was never informed.

261
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,280
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- That's not what they said in the paper.

262
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,052
You can all go straight to hell.

263
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,755
You see that? Do you see
what I'm going through?

264
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,920
So what?

265
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,591
Someone dropped an egg on my head
as I went into my building last night.

266
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,567
I'm being heckled on-stage.
People are yelling out "Gillooly."

267
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,765
Well, I'm having
a little trouble with all this.

268
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,103
I mean, all I ever wanted
to do is sing...

269
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,213
...and now I'm the focus of
this big media frenzy.

270
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,146
And none of the other actors
in the show will even talk to me.

271
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,945
Stop your crying, will you.

272
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,587
- What?
- You heard him.

273
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,053
Don't you chime in.
You're the reason this happened.

274
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,658
Oh, yeah? I read what you
said to the papers yesterday.

275
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,384
How you werert in on the planning.

276
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,552
What planning?
You think we planned this?

277
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,426
- How dare you say we planned this!
- Wait, I know you three.

278
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,468
You knocked Bette Midler out of
Rochelle, Rochelle: The Musical.

279
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,195
I want you creeps out of my cab.

280
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,533
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Get out of my cab!

281
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,643
You should go to prison,
eat prison food the rest of your life.

282
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,506
Get out. Get out, each of you.

283
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,943
Each and every one of you,
get out of my cab!

284
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,543
Then, in the distance,
I heard the bulls...

285
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,323
...and I began running
as fast as I could.

286
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,785
Fortunately, I was wearing
my Italian capto oxfords.

287
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,830
Sophisticated yet different,
without making a huge fuss about it.

288
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,597
Rich, dark-brown calfskin leather.

289
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,259
Matching linen vamp.

290
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,932
Mers whole and half sizes,
7 through 13, price $ 135.

291
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,576
Oh, that's not too expensive.

292
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,110
I like that shirt.
Where did you get it?

293
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,342
This innocent-Iooking shirt has
something which isn't innocent at all.

294
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,950
Touchability.

295
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,581
Heavy, silky, Italian cotton...

296
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:16,421
...a fine, almost terrycloth-like feeling.

297
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,128
Five-button placket, relaxed fit.

298
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,927
Innocence and mayhem at once.

299
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,262
That's not bad.

300
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,697
So many years, Frank.

301
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,309
So many years.

302
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,311
If only you had taken
your shoes off.

303
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,813
Couldrt, because I had
a potential foot problem.

304
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,679
I thought maybe you had
holes in your socks.

305
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,616
I wiped them for two minutes
on the mat.

306
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,154
I don't know why your father
made a case out of it.

307
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:50,057
Anyway, that's all in the past.
We have our whole future ahead of us.

308
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,355
Between you and me...

309
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,159
...I think your country is placing
a lot of importance on shoe removal.

310
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,170
You stopped short with me?
We don't do that in Korea.

311
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,899
Take me home!
I never want to see you again.

312
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,611
Hi.

313
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,008
Here.

314
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,480
I made this for you.

315
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,516
- What is it?
- It's Macaroni Midler!

316
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,592
- Macaroni Midler?
- Yeah, yeah.

317
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,694
- See how you're singing?
- Yeah.

318
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,474
- What's that from?
- That's a song from my show.

319
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,225
What do you think?

320
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,802
You are so freaking talented.

321
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,468
So look who's here.

322
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,510
- What do you want?
- We want to talk to her.

323
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,707
We want to apologize and tell her
the whole thing was an accident.

324
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,852
No, I'm sorry,
it's out of the question.

325
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,317
- What?
- Bette is recuperating right now...

326
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,752
...and I'm not gonna allow
anything to disturb her.

327
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,489
Who are you to decide?

328
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,255
I'm calling the shots around here
so there won't be any more accidents.

329
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,764
- Hey, look, Kramer, don't you...
- I don't want her disturbed.

330
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,165
All right, we are gonna
go find a security guard.

331
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:49,243
- What's wrong?
- I have a very bad feeling about this.

332
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,847
Yeah.

333
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,951
Wait a second. What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

334
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,954
There's only one place
where I know you'll be safe.

335
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,092
Are you insane?!

336
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,957
- Hello, Elaine.
- Oh, hi.

337
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,826
- We're so excited.
- Thank you so much.

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,524
Oh, you're welcome.

339
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,431
- See you inside.
- Okay.

340
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,870
What happened?

341
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:20,307
Well, I felt bad about the spying,
so I got them tickets to the show.

342
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,174
That's nice.
All right, see you later.

343
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:26,306
Wait, wait, wait. I didn't even get
to tell you about my new job.

344
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,478
- Where?
- Writing for the J. Peterman catalog.

345
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,647
How did you get that?

346
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,149
I met him.

347
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,618
- You met J. Peterman?
- Yeah.

348
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,784
What is he like?

349
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,932
He wore a classic
horsemars duster...

350
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,035
...beige corduroy collar,
100 percent cotton canvas, high waist.

351
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,296
Nine pockets, six on the outside.

352
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,101
Great for running
alongside a train...

353
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,176
...waving last goodbyes,
posing on a veranda.

354
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,842
- Mers sizes small, medium, large...
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

355
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,506
- Well, break a leg tonight.
- I'm really nervous.

356
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,779
Here, you got a telegram.
Well, look who's here.

357
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,252
- Listen, buddy...
- What, are you gonna break my legs?

358
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,518
You don't scare me.
You or your goons.

359
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,723
How do you like that.

360
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,730
- What is it?
- My grandmother died.

361
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,801
- Oh, I'm so sorry...
- Oh, no, it's okay. I'm fine.

362
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,203
So you don't cry
when your grandmother dies...

363
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,275
...but a hot dog makes
you lose control?

364
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,741
Places, everyone!

365
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,846
- I gotta go on now.
- Good luck.

366
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,414
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this evening's performance...

367
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,815
...the part of Rochelle will be played
by Gennice Graham.

368
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,190
- Gennice...?
- Gennice Graham?

369
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,521
- What happened to Bette Midler?
- Oh, she got hurt.

370
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,163
No Bette Midler?

371
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,877
Wait, wait.

372
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,481
Hold it.

373
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,344
Stop!

374
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,282
I'm sorry, I have to start it over.

375
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,755
Look at my shoelace.

376
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,827
I can't do it like this.

377
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,829
Please let me start it over?

378
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,762
Please?

379
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,998
Please?

380
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,108
Your turn!
