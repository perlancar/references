1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy birthday to you.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,500
Thanks.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,300
Elaine, cake?

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,400
Uh, no, thanks.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,500
It's Walter's special day.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,300
You know, there are 200 people 
who work in this office. 

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,000
Every day is somebody's special day.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,500
Elaine! Where're you going? 

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,400
It's Walter's last day. 
We have to celebrate.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
It's his birthday and it's his last day?

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,700
This is other-Walter, from returns.

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, what's going on here?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Surprise!

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Oh guys.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Elaine, it's my last day. 
Have a piece.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,900
All right, pile it on.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,900
For he's a jolly good fellow...
happy birthday to you...

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,900
What is so bad about 
having a little piece of cake?

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,200
It is the forced socializing. 

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,200
I mean, just because we work in the same office, 
why do we have to act like we're friends?

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,700
Why aren't you there now?

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,700
I had to take a sick day, 
I'm so sick of these people. 

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,600
By the way, I talked to Lisi, 
and tomorrow night's good for her.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,100
You know, I shouldn't go out 
with a friend of yours. 

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,500
I foresee messiness.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,200
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, 

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,100
reading comic books, 
and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,100
Speaking of tomato sauce-- you want to 
come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,400
Your old high school hangout? Why?

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,000
They're closing. 
We're going for one last slice.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey. All right. Hi. 

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Check it out, official police caution tape. 

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,500
Step back, son, 
there's nothing to see here.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,700
Where did you get this?

35
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,600
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,300
You sure have a lot of friends. 
How come I never see any of these people?

37
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
They want to know why they never see you.

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm gonna eat that later.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
So they just gave you this?

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,100
Oh no, no, no. 

41
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,500
I had to fish around 
in the evidence room for it. 

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
You know, they're all preoccupied, 

43
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,600
trying to hunt down 
this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. 

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,500
All right, I'll see ya.

45
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
Who is the Lopper?

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,700
Oh, it's no big deal. 

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,200
It's just some guy who's been 
running around Riverside park. 

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
You know, cutting people's heads off.

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,900
How come I haven't read about this?

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,500
The police, they've been having some 
internal dissension about the name.

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,800
Really? What're the other titles?

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Uh, Headso... 
uh...The Denogginizer...

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Son of dad.

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,100
Son of dad?

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,100
Yeah. That was my suggestion. 
It's sort of a catchall.

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Mario's Pizza.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Just as she was. 

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, Mario! 
Remember us?

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
No.

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
We used to come in every day.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,800
So where ya been? 
We're tanking here.

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,100
We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, thanks. 
That'll save us.

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,000
All right, make it the large sodas.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? 
I used to be so into this game. 

66
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,800
Gettin' that frog across the street 
was my entire life.

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Yeah. And then you went on to...

68
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,700
Well, it's a good game.

69
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,900
Watch the truck!

70
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,300
Double jump! 

71
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,000
Eat the fly! Eat it!

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
Thanks a lot.

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,300
Ah, beat it, punk.

74
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Hey, look at the high score!

75
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,600
"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. 

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
That's not you, is it?

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,800
Yes! 860,000. 

78
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I can't believe it's still standing. 
No one has beaten me in like 10 years.

79
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,500
I remember that night.

80
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh, I was unstoppable.

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,300
Perfect combination of 
Mountain Dew and mozzarella.

82
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,200
Just the right amount of 
grease on the joy stick.

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Here's your pizza pea brains.

84
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,600
I think I remember 
why we stopped coming here.

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Yeah.

86
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,500
<i>This pen smells really bad. 

87
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,100
<i>So why do I keep smelling it?

88
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,100
<i>Is it too late for me to go to law school?

89
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
What is this?

90
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,000
You were out sick yesterday, 
so we got you a get-well cake.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,700
It's carrot. 
It's good for you.

92
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,500
Get well, get well soon, 
we wish you to get--

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,200
Stop it! 

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,900
That's not even a song!

95
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,600
I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?

96
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I think it's nice.

97
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,400
What? What is nice? 

98
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Trying to fill the void in your life 
with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? 

99
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,700
I mean, we are all unhappy. 
Do we have to be fat, too? 

100
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,200
Not you, Becky. 
I know you have a slow metabolism. 

101
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,700
I don't want 
one more piece of cake in my office!

102
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,600
Get well, get well soon--

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not happening.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Can we still it eat?

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I'll tell you Lisi, 
I never expected that movie to...

106
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,100
... end under water?

107
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,700
... be that long. 
I mean, most action movies are...

108
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,900
... so much more violent.

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,400
... not as long.

110
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,700
Well, I should probably...

111
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,000
... get going.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,200
Yeah.

113
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Well, it was nice meeting you. 
I'm sure I'll see you...

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
... eight tomorrow?

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,500
Actually, that's...

116
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,300
... what you were thinking.

117
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Right.

118
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,500
Oh! Here you are. 

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
You, uh, you want to--

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,500
Sure.  

121
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,600
How about this one?

122
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,500
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. 

123
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm buying the Frogger machine. 
Now the torch will burn forever.

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,200
Fabulous. See, now 
you're really doing something.

125
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza 
with me and help me pick up the Frogger?

126
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,100
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine 
plugged in while you move it?

127
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
What?

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,100
Once you unplug the machine, 
all the scores will be erased.

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
You're right. 
Why must there always be a problem? 

130
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,700
You'd think just once I could get a break. 

131
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,700
God knows I earned it with that score!

132
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,400
Well, more bad news Jerry.

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,500
You know the police, they found another 
victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. 

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,200
I saw the photo, 
and it looked a lot like you.

135
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Oh, come on.

136
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,500
There's a lot of people 
walking around the city that look like me.

137
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Not as many as there used to be.

138
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,400
No. I need a guy that can 
rig a Frogger machine,

139
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,700
so that I can move it without losing power,

140
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,700
'cause I have the high score. 
H-hello?

141
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,100
You know, George, you're not gonna find 
an electrician like that in the yellow pages. 

142
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,400
Now, I know just the guy who can do this.

143
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,100
Another friend?

144
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Oh, no no no. This guy is no friend. 
In fact, we don't even get along.

145
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Well, is he good, Kramer?

146
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Oh, he's the best...

147
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,700
and the worst.

148
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Kramer, listen to me. 
I'm never gonna have a child. 

149
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
If I lose this Frogger high score, 
that's it for me.

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Believe me, George, 
you can count on Slippery Pete.

151
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,600
Slippery Pete?

152
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Yeah, I don't care for 
the name either. 

153
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,100
In fact, that's one of the things 
that we argue about.

154
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,600
All right. 
I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. 

155
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,600
GLC must live on!

156
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Come on.

157
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,500
Hello?

158
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,100
So how's it going with my friend?

159
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,100
She's a sentence finisher. 
It's like dating Mad Libs.

160
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,100
What is that?

161
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Oh, it's a cake party. 
It's the third one today. 

162
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,100
I didn't realize how hooked I got 
on that 4:00 sugar rush.

163
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,000
So join in.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I can't. I denounced them. 

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. 
He's always got a truffle or something in there.

166
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,700
All right.

167
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Hey, wh-what--

168
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Yeah. I dropped an egg. 
Be careful.

169
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,200
Anybody here? 

170
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Peterboy?

171
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Ooh, it's a cake walk.

172
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Get well, get well soon, 
we wish you to get well.

173
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,700
Oh, what a stirring 
little anthem of wellness.

174
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,300
Elaine!
- Mr. Peterman, um--

175
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,700
We missed you at the get well party. 

176
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. 

177
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,000
It's benign, but-- ooh-- still a bastard. 

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, Elaine-- 
can you keep a secret?

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, sir, I can't.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Inside that small college boy minifridge 
is my latest acquisition. 

181
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,900
A slice of cake from the wedding 
of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson.

182
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Circa 1937, 
price-- $29,000.

183
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,500
Well Lisi, that was another...

184
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,200
... lovely evening.

185
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,400
... really bad meal. 
I was thinking maybe we should...

186
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,600
... go for a hansom cab ride?

187
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
... call it a night. 

188
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,500
I'll walk you home. 
Where do you live?

189
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
84th street, right off Riverside Park.

190
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
Riverside Park.

191
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
I thought we were going--

192
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Back to my place. 
That's right.

193
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
So you slept with her?

194
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,200
She lives right off Riverside Park. 

195
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,000
I was scared of the Lopper, 
so I let her stay over.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,800
And you automatically sleep with her?

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, I just wanted to make out a little, 
but she kind of...

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
... finished your thought.

199
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Guess what I ate.

200
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,300
An ostrich burger.

201
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,300
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. 

202
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Peterman got it at the 
Duke and Duchess of Windsor auction. 

203
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,900
It's the most romantic thing 
I've ever eaten.

204
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,600
How did it taste?

205
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
A little stale.
- Yeah.

206
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,900
So, uh-- 
are you sleeping with Peterman?

207
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,800
No. 

208
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,200
He doesn't know I ate it. 

209
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,700
In fact, he almost caught me. 

210
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,900
I have to sneak back in 
and even it out.

211
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,900
You know, they say ostrich has less fat, 
but you eat more of it.

212
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Hey, so I talked to Lisi 
and she has got a big surprise for you. 

213
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,300
She's planning a weekend trip 
to Pennsylvania Dutch country.

214
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,700
Pennsylvania Dutch country? 

215
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh, that's the 
serious relationship weekend place.

216
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,300
What is going on with you two?

217
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Well, I think by sleeping with her, 
I may have sent her the wrong message.

218
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,200
What's that?

219
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,700
4:00 sugar fix.

220
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Well, I'm calling this off right now.

221
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,700
No, no. You are way past 
the phone call breakup stage.

222
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,600
Well, I'm not going over there. 
That's where the Lopper is.

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
It's daylight. 

224
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,600
It won't take you that long. 
Just make a clean break.

225
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Just a little off the side...

226
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,600
Perfect.

227
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Well, no point in wasting $1,200.

228
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,600
<i>Oh, commander, 
isn't the wedding marvelous? 

229
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,800
<i>More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. 

230
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,300
<i>I mustn't. 

231
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,300
Ah, what the hell.

232
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,100
Now, each of you is here 
because you're the best at what you do.

233
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me 
you are one hell of a rogue electrician. 

234
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,700
And Shlomo, you're the best truck driver.

235
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,200
I don't know If I'm the best.

236
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh... you're very good.

237
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Let's say "good."

238
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,300
Ok. Good. 

239
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,600
And Kramer, you're in charge of 
taping off the loading zone.

240
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,300
Lock and load.

241
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,200
You think you can handle that, 
numb nuts?

242
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,900
All right, all right, 
come on, now.

243
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,700
That was my mail-order bride.

244
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Hey, you weren't home, 
so I signed for her.

245
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,900
It doesn't give you the right 
to make out with her.

246
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
You weren't even married yet.

247
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,100
All right, all right, 
calm down, calm down. 

248
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Whatever happened in the past is past.

249
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,000
Now, this is the basic layout 
for Mario's Pizza.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So what kind of a jail time 
are we looking at if we're caught?

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,800
What do you mean?

252
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,200
We're stealing this thing, 
right?

253
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,600
No. I--I paid for it.

254
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
I thought we were stealing it.

255
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,100
Yeah. 
It feels like we're stealing it.

256
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,300
We're not stealing it.

257
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,000
I definitely thought we're stealing it.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,600
All right, let's--let's focus. 
Can we get back to the plan?

259
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,700
Well, I need a battery 
for this kind of a job. 

260
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,100
Can I at least steal a battery?

261
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,400
Fine. Steal the battery. 

262
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Now, all right, here is the Frogger. 

263
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,500
This is the front door, 
and this is the outlet.

264
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,700
What's that?

265
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,500
The outlet?

266
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Mm-hmm.

267
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,100
That's where the electricity comes out.

268
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Oh, you mean the holes.

269
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,300
Which one's the bathroom?

270
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,800
Uh, here.

271
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,900
They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.

272
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,100
The Frogger is here.

273
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
George, I thought that was the door.

274
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,500
Where are all the pizza ovens?

275
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,700
I thought the bathroom was here.

276
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,700
All right. You understand now? 
It's not that complicated.

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I need to replace 
an antique piece of cake.

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you have anything that's been--
you know, laying around for a while? 

279
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Something pre-war would be just great.

280
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Oh, hey, Elaine. 

281
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,900
What, you got the munchies?

282
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,100
Oh, Kramer, 
I am in big, big, big trouble. 

283
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,100
I need a cake that looks like this.

284
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. 
Yeah. They make good cake.

285
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,100
Do any of these look close?

286
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,000
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. 

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
Oh-- Entenmann's. Yeah.

288
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,700
Entenmann's? 
From the supermarket?

289
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,600
Well, no. 
They're not really in the supermarket. 

290
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Yeah, they got their own case 
at the end of the aisle.

291
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,100
Hi, Lisi.

292
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,700
Hi, honey. 
Is that a bat?

293
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,800
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. 

294
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,300
It's gotta be worth something.

295
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,500
So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?

296
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,200
Well, before we do anything...

297
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Maybe we should talk.

298
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing 
comes out of nowhere. 

299
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,500
I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?

300
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Then may I say something... 
without being interrupted?

301
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. 
That's exactly what I set out to do.

302
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,500
Are you afraid to kiss me in public?

303
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Have we even been in public?

304
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,400
So now you're going to tell me 
what I'm thinking. 

305
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, go ahead, 
'cause I'd really like to know.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are not dumb. 
Don't say that.

307
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,900
These beans are pretty good.

308
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,600
20 minutes.

309
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Well, I'm sorry. 
I'm not Brad. I'm me!

310
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Nice to meet ya!

311
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Boy, did your mother 
do a number on you.

312
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Fine. So it's over.

313
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,500
Oh, thank God. 

314
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,000
Why is it dark out? 
What time is it?

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
9:30.

316
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,500
We've been breaking up for 10 hours?

317
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Good-bye, Jerry.

318
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,800
Lopper. 

319
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,600
You know, Lisi, maybe 
we should give this a little more time. 

320
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,700
See how it looks in the light of day.

321
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Out!

322
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,900
Lopper.

323
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,500
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! 

324
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,200
We can work this out. 
I was wrong, you were right. 

325
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I'll do anything!

326
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,100
Jerry, you came for the big moment.

327
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,300
No. I'm waiting for...

328
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,500
Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. 

329
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,600
Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, 

330
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,100
the truck will be there any minute,
and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.

331
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Sounds great.

332
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,700
Yeah, yeah. 

333
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,900
You gotta come over tonight. 
We can play.

334
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,100
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. 
I'm going away on a long weekend.

335
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,300
Where?

336
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Look what I found. 
I got one for you, too.

337
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,000
Great. 
Uh, you know what? 

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,800
Why don't you put it in the car

339
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,000
so I don't accidentally 
toss it in that dumpster?

340
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
OK. I'll meet thee 
in front of your place, 15 minutes.

341
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,700
A long, long weekend.

342
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,700
I hear thee.

343
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,400
Elaine! Excellent. 

344
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,300
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, 
Irwin Lubeck.

345
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, hello.

346
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
Charmed.

347
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
All right, 
brace yourself, Lubeck. 

348
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
You are about to be launched via pastry 
back to the wedding of one of the most 

349
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,500
dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers 
of the entire British Royal family.

350
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,200
I guess I'll just--

351
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,700
Oh, no, Elaine, stay. 

352
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Lubeck here is the world's foremost 
appraiser of vintage pastry.

353
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,900
All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?

354
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,200
I'd say about two-nineteen.

355
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,200
$219,000! 
Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. 

356
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,500
You just made me a profit of $190,000.

357
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,500
No, $2.19. 
It's an Entenmann's.

358
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,800
Do they have a castle at Windsor?

359
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
No. They have a display case 
at the end of the aisle.

360
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh, good Lord.

361
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,200
You all right, Peterman? 
You look ill.

362
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Get well, get well soon, 
we want you to get well.

363
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Get well, get well soon,
we want you to get well.

364
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,600
What are you guys doing?

365
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Eat the fly. Eat the fly. 

366
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,100
Got him!

367
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,400
You idiots. 
You're gonna wear down the battery.

368
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
The batteries are fine. 

369
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
We've got...oh, God. 
Only 3 minutes left.

370
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,900
Quick. Get this thing 
back in the pizzeria!

371
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,300
George, they closed up.

372
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,000
I need an outlet!

373
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,900
A what?

374
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
Holes! 
I need holes!

375
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,100
The pharmacy's still open.

376
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,800
All right. 
Kramer, you block off traffic. 

377
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,200
You two go sweet-talk the pharmacist.

378
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,200
You owe me a quarter.

379
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,500
Slippery Pete.

380
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Kramer, hurry up!

381
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm out! No tape left!

382
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
Well, come on, George, 
I'll help you push it across.

383
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,900
Wait a minute. 
This looks familiar. 

384
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,600
This reminds me of something. 

385
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,900
I can do this.

386
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,800
By yourself?

387
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Jerry, I've been preparing 
for this moment my entire life.

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,600
He looks like a Frog.

389
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,600
So do you.

390
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Game over.

391
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
Mr. Peterman, 
you wanted to see me, sir?

392
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Elaine, up until a moment ago I was 
convinced that I was on the receiving end 

393
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,500
of one of the oldest 
baker's grift in the books-- 

394
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,400
the Entenmann's shim-sham.

395
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Ohh...

396
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,800
Until I remembered 
the videotape surveillance system 

397
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
that I installed 
to catch other-Walter using my latrine. 

398
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,500
But it also caught this.

399
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,100
Mr. Peterman, I, uh...

400
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Elaine, I have a question for you. 

401
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Is the item still... with you?

402
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Um...

403
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,900
As far as I know.

404
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,700
Do you know what happens 
to a butter-based frosting 

405
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,700
after six decades 
in a poorly ventilated English basement?

406
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,300
Uh, I guess I hadn't--

407
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,300
I have a feeling, what you are about to 
go through is punishment enough. 

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Dismissed.
