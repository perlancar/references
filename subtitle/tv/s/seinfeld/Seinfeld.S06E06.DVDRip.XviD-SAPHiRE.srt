1
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,299
I never figured out why
they make these bizarre toilet seats.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:10,409
You know? Like those clear Lucite
ones with all the coins in it?

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:14,377
It's a lovely tribute to our
past president. It's not bad enough...

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:19,246
...Lincoln got shot in the head, we
gotta drop our pants and sit on it too.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,281
It's just incomprehensible
that you would buy a thing like this.

6
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,948
You install it on your toilet seat.
And this says what about you?

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,888
I can't afford to throw money down
the toilet, but look how close I am.

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,107
I cannot believe Lindsay's seeing you
after that Breakfast at Tiffany's thing.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,141
I think she finds
my stupidity charming.

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,603
- As we all do.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,547
Anyway, she's having some kind
of a family lunch. I'll swing by after.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,414
- So you gonna meet the mother?
- I'll zip in. "How do you do?"

13
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,249
- Zip out. She'll love me.
- You're good with the mothers.

14
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,723
You know, I'm better with the mothers
than I am with the daughters.

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,988
- Maybe you should date the mothers.
- Lf I could talk to the mothers...

16
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:08,294
...and have sex with the daughters,
then I'd really have something going.

17
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,129
- You've got something going.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,967
- Hey.
- Hey.

19
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,333
- You got a hammer?
- What do you need a hammer for?

20
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,499
I got this new poster, 3-D art.
Computers generate it.

21
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,407
- Yeah, I wanna see that. Bring it over.
- I don't have it now.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,640
I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's.
Elaine was framing stuff for him...

23
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,751
...so she did me a favor.
Wanna take a ride?

24
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,047
- No, I don't think so.
- George, you wanna go for a ride?

25
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,849
- No.
- Oh, come on!

26
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,084
Could you wait until the man
finishes...?

27
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,219
All right, I've had it with you two.

28
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,728
Hey, guess what? Remember that
woman you saw me with?

29
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,593
She used to be
an Olympic gymnast.

30
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,368
- A gymnast?
- Yeah. She's Romanian.

31
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,595
She won a silver
at the '84 Olympics.

32
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,173
A gymnast, Jerry.
Think of the flexibility.

33
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,441
That sex will melt your face.

34
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,277
- Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
- Bailing?

35
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,941
Kramer, there's always a price
to pay for just a sexual dalliance.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,281
Jerry, you should pay that price.

37
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,553
She's Romanian. What will I talk
to her about? Ceausescu?

38
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,518
Ch... What?

39
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,724
Gymnast? I can't believe it.
You didn't tell me she was a gymnast.

40
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,958
What is this?

41
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,403
I'm putting my shirt back on.

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,678
Back on? What was it doing off?

43
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,878
I take it off when I go to the...
You know, to the office.

44
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,049
What for?

45
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,852
Frees me up, no encumbrances.

46
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,153
- Unbuttoned or all the way off?
- All the way, baby.

47
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,127
Of course.

48
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,095
Again? Kramer, if you keep
getting these attacks...

49
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,603
...you should see the doctor
and have it checked out.

50
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,365
Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,244
- You always take the shirt off?
- Always.

52
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,279
I tell you, knowing you is like going
into the jungle.

53
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,248
I never know what I'm gonna find next,
and I'm real scared.

54
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,924
Elaine, I need you to proofread
this report for my meeting...

55
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,582
...with the Poland Creek
bottled-water people.

56
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,626
- What meeting?
- I told you.

57
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,264
I sit on the board of trustees
for Morgan Springs...

58
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,026
...and we're trying to acquire
Poland Creek.

59
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,898
Are you using a fountain pen?

60
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,867
- Yes.
- They smear.

61
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,002
Under no circumstances is ink
to be used in this office.

62
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:39,314
All right, I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.

63
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,949
- Elaine.
- Come in. Come in.

64
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,022
Yeah.

65
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,057
Hi, right there. Yeah.

66
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,924
- That's not it.
- Kramer, it's that...

67
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,590
- There she blows.
- Kramer?

68
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,799
Kramer, could you do this at home?
I don't think...

69
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,906
- I've got work to do, okay?
- These are nice corners.

70
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,977
Elaine, did I hear...?
This is very odd.

71
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:10,343
Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers
generate them, big computers.

72
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,781
Yes, I've heard about these.
How do they work?

73
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,047
You blur your eyes like you're staring
straight through the picture...

74
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,589
...and you keep
your eyes unfocused.

75
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,351
Then...

76
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,625
Yeah!

77
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,897
- I don't see it.
- It's a spaceship...

78
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,526
...surrounded by planets, asteroids.
- I still don't see it.

79
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,970
Okay. Kramer, that's enough.
Mr. Pitt has got work to do.

80
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,632
You ever dream in 3-D?

81
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,937
It's like the boogeyman
is coming right at you.

82
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,876
- A spaceship, where?
- Right in here.

83
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,413
Just keep your eyes unfocused.

84
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,318
- Oh, Mama.
- Kramer, what's wrong?

85
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,354
- Mama.
- Kramer, are you okay?

86
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,424
I think I got to go to the doctor.
Oh, Mama!

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,485
How long does it usually take?

88
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:07,229
George, it is so nice
to finally meet you.

89
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,705
And I'm sorry
we've kept Lindsay so long.

90
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,605
- Mother.
- No, no, not at all.

91
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,872
I have always felt that the
most important thing in the world...

92
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,811
...is spending time with family.

93
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,342
Are you and your family close?

94
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,922
Very close. Almost painfully close.

95
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,522
Mother, I'm gonna walk Nana
and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator.

96
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,628
George, do you mind
waiting one more minute?

97
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,287
Mind? Why would I mind?
I would love to wait.

98
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,923
Nana, nice to see you.
Nana!

99
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,134
Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure,
what a pleasure.

100
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,865
Hey, let's do this again real soon.
I had fun.

101
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,168
- Can I offer you anything to eat?
- No, I'm fine.

102
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,336
- Let me help you with these dishes.
- George, you don't have to.

103
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,175
No, I know I don't have to,
I want to.

104
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,616
George, you are such a gentleman.

105
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,721
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright.

106
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,220
Here we go. All right.

107
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,883
Mrs. Enright!

108
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,542
Mrs. Enright!

109
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,588
Look, there's a spaceship.
That is so cool.

110
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,658
Where is it?

111
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,384
- Right here.
- I'm looking there!

112
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,394
- No, no, unfocus.
- I am unfocused!

113
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,192
Hello?

114
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,530
Oh, yeah. Okay, fine.
He'll be right down.

115
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,108
Car's here to pick you up
and take you to the meeting.

116
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,074
Meeting?

117
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,743
The Poland Creek merger.

118
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,819
- Why don't you go for me?
- How can I go?

119
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,080
All they're gonna do
is read the report.

120
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,423
Mr. Pitt, I do not think
that is just such a good idea.

121
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,583
Oh, damn this thing!

122
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:15,898
So Ceausescu,
he must have been some dictator.

123
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,868
Yes, he was not shy about dictating.

124
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,767
He must have been dictating
first thing in the morning.

125
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,208
- I want a cup of coffee and a muffin.
- And you could not refuse.

126
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,507
No, you'd have to be crazy.

127
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,008
- He was a very bad dictator.
- Yes.

128
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,319
Very bad.

129
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,253
Very, very bad.

130
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,459
So let me get this straight.
You find yourself in the kitchen.

131
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,828
You see an eclair
in the receptacle...

132
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,563
...and you think to yourself:

133
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,467
"What the hell,
I'll just eat some trash."

134
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,539
No, no, no. It was not trash.

135
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,476
- Was it in the trash?
- Yes.

136
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,476
Then it was trash.

137
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,847
It wasrt down in.
It was sort of on top.

138
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,315
- But it was in the cylinder.
- Above the rim.

139
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,221
Adjacent to refuse is refuse.

140
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,055
It was on a magazine,
and it still had the doily on.

141
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,290
- Was it eaten?
- One little bite.

142
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,993
Well, that's garbage.

143
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,206
But I know who took the bite.
It was her aunt.

144
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:33,571
You, my friend, have crossed the line
that divides man and bum.

145
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,044
You are now a bum.

146
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,875
Hey.

147
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,283
What's with you?

148
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,251
I got a stone.

149
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,756
- What stone?
- A kidney stone.

150
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,416
What is that, anyway?

151
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:53,156
It's a stony mineral concretion...

152
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,698
...formed abnormally in the kidney.

153
00:08:55,868 --> 00:09:00,100
And this jagged shard of calcium
pushes its way through the ureter...

154
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:04,869
...into the bladder.
It's forced out through the urine.

155
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,678
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

156
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,508
Our shareholders
have given basic approval...

157
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,655
...for the merger,
including the stock swap.

158
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,592
The stock swap.
Let's swap some stock.

159
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,489
If you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt
and tell him that we expect...

160
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,099
...to be in full-scale production
by the spring.

161
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,735
All right. Hey, you guys,
what's the name...

162
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,304
...of the new company gonna be?
- Moland Spring.

163
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,775
- Moland?
- Yes.

164
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,309
We combined Morgan and Poland.

165
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,174
Yeah, I know, but Moland?

166
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,011
I wouldn't drink
anything called Moland.

167
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,743
But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.

168
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:54,023
Well, what's in a name?
I mean, water is water, right?

169
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,060
We've got to do something
about that name.

170
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:02,557
No, Lindsay, it was not in the garbage.
It was above the garbage.

171
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,602
Hovering like an angel.

172
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,433
Of course I know your aunt bit it.
I kissed her goodbye.

173
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,845
Listen, can I tell you something else?
In my family...

174
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,211
...we used to eat out of the garbage
all the time. It was no big thing.

175
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,046
That's right. Okay.

176
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,314
Bye-bye. I'm back in.
She gave me a second chance.

177
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,355
- Good for you.
- Yes. Good for me.

178
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,460
You know what you should do now?
Get her flowers, smooth it out.

179
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,726
Yes. Flowers. I will get her flowers.
I will go to the florist.

180
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,529
Behold, the games
of the '84 Olympiad.

181
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,971
- Katya's silver-medal performance.
- Kramer, you're still on this?

182
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,168
I've seen gymnasts.
I know what they do.

183
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,473
- It's not gonna make any difference.
- Jerry, what is your problem?

184
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,449
Kramer, you know,
guys like you with no conscience...

185
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,678
...don't know what it's like
for guys like me.

186
00:10:55,855 --> 00:11:00,155
I'm in the unfortunate position of
having to consider people's feelings.

187
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,193
All right, Jerry, are you familiar
with the Kama Sutra?

188
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,920
- No.
- Tantric yoga.

189
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,430
- No.
- Jerry, you stand on the threshold...

190
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,161
...to the magical world
of sensual delights...

191
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,329
...that most men dare not dream of.

192
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,865
Boy, you can really talk some trash.

193
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,341
I guess that's better than eating it.

194
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,346
All right, why don't we just watch
the tape, huh?

195
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,144
- Did you pass your stone yet?
- Not yet.

196
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,284
But the suspense is killing me.

197
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,790
- Hey, that's her.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's her.

198
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,394
Look at the height, Jerry,
the extension.

199
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,464
Watch the tuck,
handstand, half turn...

200
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,158
...giant into a straddle,
back into another handstand...

201
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,496
...nice kip, reverse hecht.

202
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,730
Nice leg extension. Good form.

203
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,375
Here comes the big dismount.
Look at the rotation.

204
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,377
Full in, double back,
and she sticks the landing.

205
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,916
Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape.

206
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,186
I'll take that as a yes.

207
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,423
Well, here we are.

208
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,525
Yes, we are here.

209
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,899
How did you stay on that beam
like that? It's only this wide.

210
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,532
I can balance myself in any position.

211
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:31,113
It is amazing, after years of training,
how one can contort one's body.

212
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:36,118
Of course, it is only useful
in gymnastics.

213
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,784
Oh, boy.

214
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,625
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was entering...

215
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,563
...a magical world
of sensual delights.

216
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:54,502
It was just so ordinary.
There was nothing gymnastic about it.

217
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,036
What did you think
she was going to do?

218
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,773
You know, I mean... I don't know.

219
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,508
No, what?

220
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,814
- Obviously, I prefer not mention any...
- Did you think she was gonna take...

221
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,650
...some of that chalk and...
- I really don't wanna get into it.

222
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,159
- Oh, come on. One thing.
- You know, any kind of specifics.

223
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,158
One thing. What?

224
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:24,402
Well, frankly, I thought, you know,
I was gonna be like the apparatus.

225
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,669
You mean like
the uneven parallel bars?

226
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,037
- Again, I don't feel like...
- The balance beam?

227
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,578
- Could we stop?
- Not the pommel horse.

228
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,316
Let's just drop it.

229
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,215
So let me ask you this.
How long would you say...

230
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,826
...I have to put in now
because of, you know, last night?

231
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,190
- I don't know, at least three weeks.
- Oh, great.

232
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,331
Jerry, that is such small potatoes.

233
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,026
I think that I may have
single-handedly put the kibosh...

234
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,536
...on the big water merger.
- Between Poland and Morgan?

235
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,106
Yeah. Started a big
name controversy.

236
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,942
Kramer. The stone.

237
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,743
What happened?
Did you pass the stone?

238
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:16,081
No, I tried to do a reverse hecht
off my couch, and I didn't make it.

239
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,392
You call this coffee?

240
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,024
Hey!

241
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,068
What the hell was that?

242
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,432
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Clean that up!

243
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,735
Oh, sure. Of course.

244
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,502
Could you hold these
for just a second?

245
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,482
Here you go.
Don't worry about a thing.

246
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,553
It's gonna be fine.
Here we go. Look at this shine.

247
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,157
Look at this sparkle.

248
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,167
Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!

249
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,763
Mrs. Enright!

250
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,978
Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled
coffee on the gentlemars windshield.

251
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,275
Why would I do that? I have a job.

252
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,385
Well, did she see a squeegee?

253
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,054
You're not gonna make
a dime without a squeegee.

254
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,925
That's right. Just tell your mother
it was all a big misunderstanding.

255
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,825
You won't regret it.

256
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,330
Okay, I'll see you later.

257
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,599
Bye-bye.

258
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,595
Strike two.

259
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,607
- You think I'm going down?
- You're behind in the count.

260
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,471
- Hey, what are you doing later?
- Going out with Katya, thanks to you.

261
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,083
Well, you know,
maybe you should try again.

262
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,814
You know what happens the first time.
People are a little shy, a little reticent.

263
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,517
If I do it again, that extends
my payment book another two weeks.

264
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,617
- Where are you going?
- The circus.

265
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,855
One of her old Olympic teammates
is an acrobat.

266
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:10,559
- I don't even feel like going out.
- Jerry, it's your obligation, come on.

267
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,569
Yeah, well, if I gotta go
and spend time with this girl...

268
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,536
...you're coming with me,
Dr. Cyclops.

269
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,734
- No, I don't wanna go to the circus.
- Yeah? Well, you're going.

270
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,209
But I'm afraid of clowns.

271
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,518
I didn't send you over there
to complain about the name.

272
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,985
I couldn't help it. Moland Springs?

273
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,953
I like the name Moland.

274
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,649
I picked it out.

275
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,159
After all those months
of negotiating.

276
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,890
- Well, I'm so sorry.
- Well, I'm going riding.

277
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,334
I haven't been on Jenny
for three days.

278
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,233
All because of this blasted painting.

279
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,037
- Elaine?
- Oh, sorry.

280
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,678
Hello.

281
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,042
Wait a minute.

282
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,877
Wait a minute.

283
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,395
So, Jerry,
you're enjoying the circus?

284
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,431
Greatest show on earth.

285
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,465
My father used to take me
to the circus.

286
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,407
When the elephants came by,
he would scream curses at them...

287
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,173
...blaming them for all the ills
of society.

288
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,245
Well, they certainly take up
a lot of space.

289
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,788
- Misha.
- Katya.

290
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,390
Misha, this is Jerry.

291
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,323
Yes, the comedian.

292
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,767
Oh, yes. Yes, I'll tell him.
Yes, thank you.

293
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,600
Hold on, hold on. Mr. Pitt?

294
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,002
I think I'm on to something.

295
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,303
Mr. Pitt, the board of directors
is on the phone.

296
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,036
They've called
an emergency meeting.

297
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,078
You need to be there
to discuss the merger.

298
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,808
You said keep your eyes out of focus,
which is misleading.

299
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,713
You want deep focus.

300
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,083
Yes, hi, okay. Fine. Yeah.
Hold on just a second. Let me just...

301
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,548
Yeah, I've got it...

302
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,958
Yeah, he'll be there.

303
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:22,258
Mr. Pitt, you have got to stop
staring at that poster!

304
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,165
I see something that could be a
spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointed?

305
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,432
No! You don't see it,
and you're never gonna see it!

306
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,603
Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the
shareholders. You have to leave now.

307
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,146
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

308
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,875
My goodness.
What's happened to me?

309
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,884
- Whers the meeting?
- In about 20 minutes.

310
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,454
Do I have time to change?

311
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,985
- No.
- Well, excuse me.

312
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,025
I better get straight over there.

313
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,623
- Mr. Pitt...
- Yes?

314
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,532
- There's a...
- Is that ink?

315
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,302
No.

316
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,335
Well, here we are.

317
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,676
Do you wanna come in?
My mother's having a little party.

318
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,586
- Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
- Sure.

319
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,848
Ladies and gentlemen, may I direct
your attention to the center ring...

320
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,585
...where the incomparable Misha
will balance 10 stories...

321
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:27,027
...above the circus floor on a wire
no wider than a human thumb.

322
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,230
It is time.

323
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,162
Break a leg.

324
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,132
- Show biz.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

325
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,175
...the incomparable Misha!

326
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,172
Those capes
are really coming back.

327
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:51,017
Sorry I took so long. They've got
one of those 3-D art posters in there.

328
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,919
It's mesmerizing.

329
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,184
What is that sound?

330
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,226
It is horrible.

331
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,780
Anybody see that poster in there?
That is weird, wild stuff, huh?

332
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,902
I have been accused
of wrongdoing...

333
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,175
...but these false accusations
will not deter us.

334
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:24,475
We will annex Poland by the spring
at any cost!

335
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,650
And our stock will rise high.

336
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,699
The doctor said Misha
is going to be all right.

337
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,893
I must go and be with Misha now.

338
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,868
- I don't want you to come with me.
- Why not?

339
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,770
It has been three days
since our night together.

340
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:54,571
Misha said that was all the time
I needed to put in.

341
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,046
- Really?
- In my country...

342
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,913
...they speak of a man so virile,
so potent...

343
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,250
...that to spend a night
with such a man is to enter a world...

344
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,690
...of sensual delights
most women dare not dream of.

345
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,923
This man is known
as the comedian.

346
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,204
You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld,
but you are no comedian.
