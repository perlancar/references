1
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:07,830
I think people think of their office
as a stationery store with Danish.

2
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:10,197
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry...

3
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:12,430
...your envelopes, your supplies...

4
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:15,575
...your toilet paper, six cups of coffee,
and you go home.

5
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:17,704
Why do people that work in offices...

6
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:21,075
...have pictures of their family
on their desk facing them?

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:23,340
Do they forget that they're married?

8
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:26,350
Do they go, "5:00. Time to hit the bars
and pick up hookers.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,511
Hold it a second.

10
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,317
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.

11
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:32,857
I completely forgot."

12
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:43,494
- She hasn't told her father yet?
- We're supposed to tell him tonight.

13
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,697
- What do you mean, "we're"?
- Susan wants me to be there.

14
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:49,172
You're meeting the father
for the first time?

15
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:53,575
- Yeah.
- You'll make quite an impression...

16
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:56,341
...when you tell him how
you burned his cabin down.

17
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,017
I didn't burn it down. Kramer did.

18
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:03,520
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.

19
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,717
The guy's nice enough to give you
a box of very fine Cuban cigars...

20
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:08,361
- I know what happened.
- No, wait.

21
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:11,623
- Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
- I know.

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,963
Who proceeds to burn
the man's cabin down...

23
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:19,537
...with one of those
very same cigars.

24
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,372
It's very comical.

25
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:25,211
Maybe we shouldn't
start writing today.

26
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,607
I got a lot on my mind.

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,044
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.

28
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:31,184
I wonder how Susan's
father's gonna react.

29
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,683
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.

30
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,082
Come on.

31
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:37,051
Not even a house. It's like a cabin.

32
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:38,816
We could build a cabin like that.

33
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:41,620
Well, maybe not us,
but two men could.

34
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:45,028
BICs? What, did you get BICs?

35
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,099
What, you got a problem
with the pen, now?

36
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:49,064
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.

37
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,670
All right, let's just get to work.

38
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:54,367
NBC pilot. Seinfeld Project.

39
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,840
Act 1, Scene A.

40
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:00,741
So you're gonna sit there?

41
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:02,677
Let me explain to you...

42
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,444
...one of the key elements involved
in the writing process.

43
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,109
Because it may seem outwardly...

44
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:10,120
...that the pen and the paper
and the chair play a large role.

45
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:15,759
But they're all somewhat incidental
to the actual using of the brain.

46
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:18,964
Okay, so just... Just park yourself.

47
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,260
All right. Act 1, Scene A.

48
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,926
- Drink?
- No. No drink.

49
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,407
- All right. Here we go.
- Act 1, Scene A.

50
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:38,349
- Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
- Yes.

51
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,687
Hi, is Elaine there?

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,452
Oh, hi, Sandra.

53
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,557
Yeah, I can hold.

54
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:54,462
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat
with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.

55
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:56,830
Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen,
I'm at a pay phone.

56
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,063
There's a lot of people
waiting to use it.

57
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,037
I'll be off in a minute!

58
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,074
Yeah, could you put me through
to Elaine?

59
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,610
Okay, thanks.

60
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,775
Are you thinking of ideas?

61
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,879
Is there any way I can
get you directly?

62
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:15,579
Every time I call, Sandra bends
my ear for, like, 20 minutes.

63
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:16,984
So we're on for later?

64
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:19,352
Yeah, I'll come by after work.

65
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:22,359
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing
happening here.

66
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:24,925
I gotta go. I gotta go.

67
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:26,929
Sandra? Sandra?

68
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,533
Can you come here
for a second?

69
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,702
- Okay. Let's go.
- Here we go.

70
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:32,930
- You got it? Here we go.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,338
Okay, how about this:

72
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:39,001
I'm in my apartment.
You come in.

73
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,147
It's beautiful.

74
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,340
And what do I say?

75
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:52,849
Could you do me a favor?

76
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,550
When my friends call...

77
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,692
...could you not talk to them
for too long?

78
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,060
Why, did Jerry say something?

79
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,724
No. No.

80
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,199
He must've said something.

81
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,735
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.

82
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,338
- I can't work for you.
- Oh, God.

83
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:09,339
- I can't. I'm leaving.
- No, Sandra...

84
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.

85
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:14,713
Listen, Jerry's under a lot
of pressure right now.

86
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:17,578
It's very hard being
a stand-up comedian.

87
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:20,584
Sometimes they don't laugh.

88
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,050
- All right, let's get going.
- All right, let's go to work.

89
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,523
- Let's go.
- Okay.

90
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:30,659
- Hey.
- We're in the middle of something.

91
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:33,391
- We're trying to do a little work here.
- Yeah, come on.

92
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,864
What's with you?

93
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,230
- No more golf.
- Why?

94
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:40,630
Remember I told you about the pro
at the Westchester Country Club...

95
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,742
...who's letting me play every time
I gave him those Cuban cigars?

96
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,744
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!

97
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:54,578
Hey, George, maybe you can
ask Susan's father for some more.

98
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:55,983
What are you, crazy?

99
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:59,421
I can't ask the guy for more cigars
after you burned down his cabin.

100
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,493
What's one thing got to do
with another?

101
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:03,824
Kramer, please.

102
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,192
Well, I can't go back
to the public courses now.

103
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,766
I can't. I won't.

104
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:11,131
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.

105
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:13,535
The grass has
big brown patches in it.

106
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:15,072
They don't rake the sand traps.

107
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:18,211
Not to mention the caliber of people
you have to play with.

108
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,614
I can't help you. You're gonna have to
get them someplace else.

109
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,773
Where? They're Cubans.

110
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:27,211
- You know what? I should take off.
- What?

111
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:30,151
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house
for dinner.

112
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:33,020
I wanna shower first,
and I wanna leave plenty of time.

113
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:35,320
You got four hours.
What about the script?

114
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,492
I think we got a bite on it.

115
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,962
Doesn't George look like
your sister Sara?

116
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:51,071
A slight resemblance.

117
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:53,778
Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

118
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:58,344
Oh, I have tremendous respect
for people who work with feet.

119
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:01,351
I mean, to dedicate yourself
to the foot...

120
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:05,716
You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean...

121
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:10,319
How are you enjoying those cigars
I gave you?

122
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:13,899
Oh, the cigars.

123
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,661
I'm sucking them down.

124
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:19,328
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

125
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:21,838
You know, those cigars
are made special for Castro.

126
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,936
I did not know that.

127
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:26,409
Weird. Wild.

128
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:31,548
- What?
- He's doing Johnny Carson, Daddy.

129
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,581
I didn't care much for his jokes.

130
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:37,722
- Daddy never laughs.
- Oh, well, so what?

131
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:39,882
Laughter. What is that?

132
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,587
I mean, what is the point
of opening your mouth and going:

133
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,693
What is that?

134
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:51,397
You know, you can't get
those cigars anywhere.

135
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:54,267
You and your cigars.

136
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,739
Wear some more lipstick.

137
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:02,846
Daddy, there's... There's something
that we have to talk to you about.

138
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:06,110
Oh, I forgot to ask you:
how'd you like the cabin?

139
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,051
Oh, the... The cabin.

140
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:10,883
Well...

141
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,190
After we get off the phone
you tell her?

142
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:18,354
Of course she knows it was me
who complained.

143
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:20,466
Now I'm responsible
for this woman quitting.

144
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,728
- Oh, this is unbelievable.
- I know.

145
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:26,634
I screwed up. It's all my fault.

146
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,742
- Would you call her?
- Oh, dial the number.

147
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,469
How could you do this?

148
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,673
I was just trying to help you.

149
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,648
Trying to help me.

150
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:42,382
Hello. Sandra.

151
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:44,183
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

152
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:47,815
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

153
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,791
See, I told Elaine...

154
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:53,091
...that it was a real treat
talking to you on the phone.

155
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,599
And she thought I was being sarcastic
because I'm a comedian, and all.

156
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,206
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a
real treat talking to her on the phone."

157
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:03,570
But I was really being sincere.

158
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:06,143
No, of course I like you.

159
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,375
Tonight?

160
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,213
Hold on a second.

161
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,650
- She wants to have a drink with me.
- Just go. Go.

162
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:17,517
- Oh, I don't...
- Go.

163
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,989
Yeah, I think I can.

164
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,455
Yeah, I know where that is.

165
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,224
Okay. I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.

166
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,390
Now I gotta have a drink with her.

167
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,365
The cabin.

168
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:32,628
Well...

169
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,073
Susan?

170
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,643
- About the cabin...
- I love that place.

171
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:42,407
My father built that cabin in 1947.

172
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:45,983
My mother was recuperating
from impetigo at the time...

173
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:49,987
...and Dad thought it would be a good
idea to get her out into the fresh air.

174
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:51,852
She died there the following winter.

175
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:57,158
And Dad passed away
10 years later to the day.

176
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:00,833
His last words to me were:

177
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,666
"Cherish the cabin."

178
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,732
Not, "Take care of your sister."
She's a paraplegic.

179
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:15,610
But, "Cherish the cabin."

180
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:18,945
And I have, for 45 years.

181
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:23,382
It's often been a sanctuary for me.

182
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,953
Kind of like Superman's
Fortress of Solitude.

183
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,288
What?

184
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:31,253
Superman.

185
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:34,366
He built a Fortress of Solitude
up at the North Pole...

186
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:37,867
...to, you know, sort of
get away from it all.

187
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:41,531
When I go, I'm passing it on to her.

188
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:46,168
Well, I'll take a hotel any day.

189
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:47,711
- Daddy?
- Yes.

190
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:50,111
Daddy, about the cabin.

191
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:54,345
Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me.

192
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:57,388
- What about it?
- Well, the thing is...

193
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:00,958
- What, what is it?
- Well, the cabin is kind of...

194
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,789
- George?
- Burned.

195
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,199
- Burned?
- There was a fire, and it...

196
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:09,801
Burned.

197
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:14,534
- The cabin burned?
- Yeah, burned.

198
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,472
Burned?

199
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:18,872
Was anything found?

200
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,071
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?

201
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,911
- No. Nothing.
- Nothing?

202
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,884
But, you know, Mr. Ross,
if you look at the whole situation...

203
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:32,616
...what with it being your cigars
and everything...

204
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,657
...it's really rather ironic.

205
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:37,922
One might even say,
in a sense, comical.

206
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:43,031
Really. Think about it.

207
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:45,763
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?

208
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,169
How could you say
something like that to me?

209
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:50,775
What? You were the one
who was talking dirty.

210
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,343
I was just trying to keep up.

211
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:56,243
- That was a weird thing to say.
- Why? It didn't mean anything.

212
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,941
I was trying to join in
so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

213
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:03,283
- Oh, I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.

214
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,481
You said much sicker things
than me.

215
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,517
- I'm leaving.
- You're making too much of this.

216
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:09,923
Excuse me.

217
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:12,087
- Let me walk you to a cab.
- That's okay.

218
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,665
The main thing is that this is
just between us.

219
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,598
- And that'll be the end of it.
- Oh, really?

220
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:20,433
I mean, people, they're not interested
in things like this.

221
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:23,098
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.

222
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,938
So we're drinking and talking.

223
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:31,481
And so she starts rubbing my leg.

224
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:34,586
Wow, what did you do?

225
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:37,154
Have you ever told a woman
to stop touching your leg?

226
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,722
- Yeah. Right.
- I know it's the wrong thing to do.

227
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:44,193
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.

228
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:47,731
I'm looking at the hand thinking,
"That hand should not be on my leg."

229
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:51,632
But I can't make my brain to get
my mouth to say the words:

230
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:53,272
"Would you mind?"

231
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:57,272
Yet women have no problem getting
the hand off. How do they do that?

232
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:59,935
I don't know. They're working
on a whole other level.

233
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,943
- All right, so go ahead.
- So then we go back to my apartment.

234
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:08,083
So we're fooling around there.

235
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:10,245
You know, it's getting
a little passionate.

236
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:13,620
And she starts with the dirty talking.

237
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:16,455
All right, all right. Hold on.

238
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,620
Time out.

239
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,269
- What did she say?
- You know. The usual.

240
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:26,462
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?

241
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,733
- Typical things.
- What's typical? Give me typical.

242
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:34,111
She says...

243
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,455
That's very dirty.

244
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,463
That's absolutely filthy.

245
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,828
And then she starts talking
about her panties.

246
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:58,696
I'm gonna need some water here.

247
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:01,798
So I said something.

248
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:03,575
Okay, what did you say?

249
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,735
Now, bear in mind,
I am just trying to keep up.

250
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:09,040
- Of course.
- Okay.

251
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:12,446
So she's talking about her panties.

252
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,553
So...

253
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,787
So I said:

254
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:20,084
"You mean, the panties your mother
laid out for you."

255
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,769
"The panties your mother
laid out for you"?

256
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:39,411
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

257
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,509
It just popped out.

258
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:45,845
- Well, how did she react?
- She flipped out. Just left.

259
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,452
Well, that's not offensive.

260
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,986
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

261
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:53,319
Look, the main thing is I don't want
Elaine to know about any of this.

262
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,222
I mean, especially the pantie remark.

263
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:58,296
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.

264
00:13:58,498 --> 00:14:00,125
What if this girl says something?

265
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,892
She will. She's going back to work.

266
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,628
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.

267
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:07,603
So Susan's father took that news
pretty hard, huh?

268
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,402
Yeah. He went into the bedroom
and started sobbing.

269
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:13,546
- Guess he didn't see the humor in it.
- Yeah.

270
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,379
- Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.
- All right.

271
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,781
- Big workday.
- That's right.

272
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:23,116
- Okay.
- Let's go.

273
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,517
- Right now.
- Let's do it.

274
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:26,386
- Okay.
- All right.

275
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:30,429
- What do you got?
- I got, you enter, you go, "Hi."

276
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:32,497
And I go, "Hello."

277
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,735
Now, we need something here.

278
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:39,398
- Oh, hey.
- Kramer! Hey!

279
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,972
- Buddy!
- You guys are working. I'll come back.

280
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:43,540
- No, no! Come on.
- No, no!

281
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,870
No, you guys should
get back to work.

282
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,536
- Don't leave. We're taking a break.
- Oh, yeah?

283
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,377
George, did you talk to that guy
about getting more cigars?

284
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:53,710
I told you. I'm not gonna do that.

285
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:56,048
Okay. Well...

286
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:59,555
I guess I'm just gonna have to
take matters into my own hands, huh?

287
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,250
All right. I'll see you guys.

288
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:04,487
Where are you going?
Don't run off like that.

289
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:16,336
Okay...

290
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:22,981
- I need to talk to someone.
- Well, what is this about?

291
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,709
Well, it's a very private matter,
but extremely urgent.

292
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:28,647
- Are you an American?
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:30,152
I see.

294
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,188
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

295
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,956
- Okay, let's get going.
- Let's get focused here.

296
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:42,829
Come on, now.
Come on, let's get it together.

297
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,334
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

298
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:47,336
Come on up.

299
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:52,110
All right, you know what
we should do?

300
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:54,405
We should go to the movies.

301
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:56,776
- Get away from the script for a while.
- We should.

302
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,442
I just have to go over to the Rosses'
and drop off Susan's sunglasses.

303
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,850
- Come with me?
- Yeah. Does she live with them?

304
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:04,250
No, no.

305
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:08,485
- Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld.
- What?

306
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:11,992
I just got a message from Sandra.
She's coming back to work.

307
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:14,232
Well, then you've just gotta fire her.

308
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,868
Don't even think about it.
There's no two ways about it.

309
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:20,569
- Why, what happened? Did you talk?
- Talk? Did I talk? l...

310
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,573
You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.

311
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,870
I've concluded,
from the basis the those talks...

312
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,513
...that this isn't anybody
you should be talking to.

313
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:31,047
- You really think I should fire her?
- Oh, yeah.

314
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:35,347
In fact, if George and I weren't
so busy working, I'd do it myself.

315
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,065
What is your name, señor?

316
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:50,463
Kramer.

317
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:53,663
So Señor Kramer,
what is this about?

318
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,173
- Cigars.
- Cigars?

319
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,178
- Cigars.
- What about cigars?

320
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,442
See, here, l...

321
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:04,810
I saved one of the cigar rings.

322
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:10,481
- You mean, one of these.
- Yeah, yeah. That's them.

323
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:14,457
Okay, so I'd like to buy
a couple of boxes of those from you.

324
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:17,926
You realize, of course,
these are illegal in your country.

325
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:20,428
Well, illegal, huh?

326
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:26,332
I like that jacket.

327
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:36,677
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

328
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,111
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

329
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:39,945
I thought you guys were
working today.

330
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,350
- Just taking a little break.
- Yeah.

331
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:45,514
- Oh, here's your sunglasses.
- Oh, thanks. Come on in for a second.

332
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:49,021
This is my brother Ricky. He's home
from college for the weekend.

333
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,163
Hey, there, young fella.

334
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,195
- What's your major?
- I don't have one.

335
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,631
Well, you should always
consider podiatry.

336
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,560
Nothing wrong with the feet.

337
00:17:57,737 --> 00:17:59,295
And this is my aunt, Sara.

338
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,536
He doesn't look like me.

339
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:06,472
Sara, what do you have
on your wheels?

340
00:18:06,646 --> 00:18:08,511
Nothing. They're clean.

341
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,410
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

342
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,019
- Yes.
- Well, they're filthy.

343
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:18,021
It's just a matter
of common courtesy.

344
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:23,126
You come in the house,
you wipe your wheels.

345
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,095
Excuse me.

346
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,894
Hello, Raymond.

347
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,365
The man from the insurance company
dropped this off.

348
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:33,232
Said it was the only thing left
from the remains of the fire.

349
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:35,340
Oh, thank you.

350
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,502
Wow, I've never seen this before.

351
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:39,940
Oh, they're letters.

352
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:42,543
- Here.
- Oh, sure.

353
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:47,815
From... From John Cheever!

354
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,714
"Dear Henry...

355
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:55,622
...last night with you was bliss.

356
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:57,763
I fear my...

357
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:02,531
...orgasm has left me a cripple.

358
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:06,229
I don't know how I shall ever
get back to work.

359
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:09,806
I love you madly, John.

360
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:13,369
P.S. Loved the cabin."

361
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,917
- Well, we really should be...
- Yeah, look at the time.

362
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:23,681
...heading out.
You know, it's a time...

363
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,483
The box!

364
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,182
My letters! Give me that!

365
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,023
Who told you to open it?

366
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:31,561
Who's John? Who's John?!

367
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,631
- I knew it.
- I wanna know who John is!

368
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,064
John Cheever? Dad!
You and John Cheever?

369
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:40,137
Yes. Yes, he was the most
wonderful person I've ever known.

370
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:42,704
And I loved him deeply.

371
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,569
In a way you could
never understand.

372
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,917
Well, we really should be
heading out.

373
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,113
Jerry hates to miss
the coming attractions.

374
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,350
- Yeah, and because of the time.
- Yeah.

375
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:03,689
Time is what he's indicating there.

376
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:07,629
Anyway, onward and upward.

377
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:11,964
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

378
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,503
- Come on, now.
- Right now.

379
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:15,607
- You and me. No fooling.
- You got it.

380
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:18,710
- All right, what do you got?
- I got, you come in, you say, "Hi."

381
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:21,278
And then I say, "Hello."

382
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:24,515
- All right. So we need something.
- Yeah.

383
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:28,214
How about this:
I say, "How's it going?"

384
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:32,357
"How's it going?" Beautiful.

385
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:35,390
- Come on. We were just on a roll now.
- All right.

386
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:37,392
- Did you get that line?
- "How's it going?"

387
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:40,430
- Did you write it down?
- I'm writing it. "How's it going?"

388
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,961
- Real good!
- What?

389
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:46,465
You know how much money
you cost me today? $429.

390
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,107
- What, how?
- I got Sandra transferred...

391
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,038
...to another office upstairs, okay.

392
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,270
So she blabs to Lippman about
my long-distance calls to Europe!

393
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,814
- What calls?
- I made a friend when I was in Europe.

394
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:01,147
And we've been in touch,
and Sandra told Lippman!

395
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,615
Did she say anything else to you?

396
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,685
Anything else? What do you mean,
"anything else"?

397
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,654
So she just left the office...

398
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:11,661
...didn't say a word to you
about anything?

399
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:15,399
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

400
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,230
Why is that beautiful?

401
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:19,894
Oh, no. Not beautiful.

402
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,733
It's $429!

403
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:23,842
Hey, look, I'm gonna pay for that.

404
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,535
- No, no.
- No, I insist.

405
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,942
I was the one that encouraged you
to fire her.

406
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,844
- The whole thing was all my...
- Okay.

407
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:32,575
Fault.

408
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:34,845
Do you smell smoke?

409
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,689
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you
to meet my new friends here.

410
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,694
This is Luis, Jorge and Umberto.

411
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:47,059
- Hey.
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.

412
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:49,963
Yeah, we're heading up
to Westchester. Gonna hit the links.

413
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:52,832
- Yeah.
- Hey, isn't that your...?

414
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,939
Oh, yeah. Okay. We're going.
All right.

415
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,343
Hey, what are you reading?

416
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,081
The Falconer, by John Cheever.
It's really excellent.

417
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:11,416
John Cheever. You ever read
any of his stuff?

418
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,082
Yeah, I'm familiar with
some of his writing. You know.

419
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,363
Look, we gotta get back to work.
We just had a big breakthrough.

420
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,364
- Okay. I'll leave you two alone.
- Okay.

421
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:23,763
Maybe I'll visit my mother.

422
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:28,532
She just bought me some new panties,
and they're all laid out for me.

423
00:22:42,722 --> 00:22:45,213
There's this whole
talking-during-sex business.

424
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:47,052
I mean, what are we doing here?

425
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:48,988
The question is...

426
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,356
...does the talking really
improve the sex?

427
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,020
Or is the sex act now...

428
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,599
...just there to spice up
the conversation?

429
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:59,236
Eventually, I'm sure people will get
too lazy even for phone sex.

430
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:02,135
They'll start having
phone machine sex.

431
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:06,341
"Yeah, I want you really bad.
Just leave it on the tape."

432
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:10,848
Then, I guess, the phone company
will come out with sex-waiting.

433
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:12,882
That'll be the new thing.

434
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:15,077
"Yeah, hold on, honey.
I got another call.

435
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:16,551
Oh, hi, baby. One second.

436
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:19,555
Honey, I've gotta take this.

437
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:21,784
Yeah, I've got sex-waiting
on the other line...

438
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:24,054
...and I've got to take this."
